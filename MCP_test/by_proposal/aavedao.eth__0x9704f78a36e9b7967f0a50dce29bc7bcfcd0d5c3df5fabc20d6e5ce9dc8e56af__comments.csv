<h1><a name=""p-58512-summary-1"" class=""anchor"" href=""#p-58512-summary-1""></a>Summary</h1>
<p>The proposal aims to onboard MetaMask mUSD stablecoin to the Aave v3 Core Instance on Ethereum and Linea.</p>
<h1><a name=""p-58512-motivation-2"" class=""anchor"" href=""#p-58512-motivation-2""></a>Motivation</h1>
<ul>
<li>MetaMask USD (mUSD) is designed to act as connective tissue across MetaMask - making it easier to ramp, swap, bridge, and spend in one seamless flow. Upcoming integrations will extend that foundation, with greater composability across MetaMask products.</li>
<li>Aligning with Aave DAO’s commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand assets, onboarding MetaMask USD mUSD will enable users to leverage MetaMask’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. The initial launch of mUSD is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and attract more mainstream users, contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a name=""p-58512-specification-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#p-58512-specification-3""></a>Specification</h1>
<p>Contract addresses will be added once mUSD is fully launched. - Risk parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers as soon as possible, and the ARFC will be updated with that feedback.</p>
<h1><a name=""p-58512-disclosure-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#p-58512-disclosure-4""></a>Disclosure</h1>
<p>TokenLogic is not directly affiliated with MetaMask and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.</p>
<h1><a name=""p-58512-next-steps-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#p-58512-next-steps-5""></a>Next Steps</h1>
<ol>
<li>If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.</li>
<li>If the Snapshot outcome is <strong>YAE</strong>, escalate the proposal to the ARFC stage.3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community &amp; service provider feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.</li>
<li>If the ARFC Snapshot outcome is <strong>YAE</strong>, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.</li>
