<h3><a name=""p-58571-date-2025-08-25-3"" class=""anchor"" href=""#p-58571-date-2025-08-25-3""></a>Date: 2025-08-25</h3>
<h3><a name=""p-58571-summary-4"" class=""anchor"" href=""#p-58571-summary-4""></a>Summary</h3>
<p>We propose the onboarding of USDG, a USD-backed stablecoin issued by Paxos, on Aave V3 Core Instance. This listing would initially enable users to deposit USDG to earn yield and borrow USDG as a stable asset. Collateral usage will be considered at a later date following review by Aave’s Risk Management teams.</p>
<h3><a name=""p-58571-motivation-5"" class=""anchor"" href=""#p-58571-motivation-5""></a>Motivation</h3>
<p>USDG is a regulated stablecoin backed 1:1 by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries, designed with regulatory compliance and transparency as core principles.</p>
<p>As a trusted stablecoin from Paxos, a regulated financial institution with a strong track record, USDG has gained significant adoption across various platforms, demonstrating market confidence and growing utility.</p>
<p>Key differentiators:</p>
<ol>
<li>Global Dollar (USDG) is issued by Paxos Digital Singapore, which is a Major Payments Institution supervised by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. USDG is issued in the EU by Paxos Issuance Europe Oy (PIE), an Electronic Money Institution regulated by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA). USDG is fully compliant with the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA).</li>
<li>Transparency: Regular attestations verify USDG’s reserves are fully backed by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries.</li>
<li>Chainlink price feed: Live and available for use in Aave integrations.</li>
</ol>
