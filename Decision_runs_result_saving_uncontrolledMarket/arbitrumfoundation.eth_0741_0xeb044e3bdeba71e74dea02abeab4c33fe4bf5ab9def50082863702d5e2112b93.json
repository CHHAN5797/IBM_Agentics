        "body": "Type: Constitutional AIP\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes to upgrade Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to ArbOS 40 “Callisto”. Callisto adds support for relevant Execution Layer (EL) changes from Ethereum’s upcoming [Pectra upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7600) (H1 2025) and a small Arbitrum Stylus related fix. Among the EL changes include a way for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to execute smart contract code directly from their addresses (via [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)) and new pre-compiles to efficiently perform operations over the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, including those for BLS signature verification (via [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)).\n\nWhile the goal of the proposed ArbOS 40 “Callisto” upgrade is to eventually be available for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain, this proposal only concerns the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains, as these two chains are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be interpreted as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject over in Arbitrum ArbOS upgrades [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\nPlease note that ArbOS Version 40 “Callisto” is a proposed upgrade that builds upon ArbOS version 32 which has been previously adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 40 instead of 33 due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability as explained [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/arbos-upgrade#step-3-schedule-the-arbos-version-upgrade).\n\n## Changes that will be included in ArbOS 40 Callisto:\n\n### [EIP-7702: Set EOA Account code ](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)\n\nEIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to set executable code adding account-abstraction functionality to EOAs such as delegation, batching, sponsorship, and privilege de-escalation. In terms of batching, multiple operations can be combined (ex. token approval, token spend) in an atomic transaction. Transaction sponsorship or paymaster support can also be extended to EOAs. Discrete permissioning can also be enabled with the use of sub-keys.\n\n### [EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)\n\nThis EIP introduces precompiles for performing cryptographic operations on the [BLS12-381 curve](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/) and focuses on enhancing the efficiency and security of those operations. This cryptographic primitive unlocks 120+ bits of security for operations over the pairing-friendly curves, compared to the existing BN254 precompile which only provides 80 bits of security. BLS signature verification is the primary use case for this EIP, though many other applications that rely on point additions, multiplications, and pairing operations stand to gain from this proposal; examples are zkSNARKS, cross-chain interactions, randomness beacons, and vector commitments.\n\n### [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)\n\nThis EIP proposes storing a wider window of block hashes in the storage of a dedicated system contract. Bundling historical block hashes within the state enables efficient data retrieval for applications that require extended access to historical block hashes, like stateless clients. If approved, ArbOS 40 will adapt this EIP to the L2 and store the same number of L2 block hashes that are generated in the time it takes for 8192 L1 blocks to be built - this is approximately 27 hours worth of L2 block hashes.\n\nType: Constitutional AIP\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes to upgrade Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to ArbOS 40 “Callisto”. Callisto adds support for relevant Execution Layer (EL) changes from Ethereum’s upcoming [Pectra upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7600) (H1 2025) and a small Arbitrum Stylus related fix. Among the EL changes include a way for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to execute smart contract code directly from their addresses (via [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)) and new pre-compiles to efficiently perform operations over the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, including those for BLS signature verification (via [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)).\n\nWhile the goal of the proposed ArbOS 40 “Callisto” upgrade is to eventually be available for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain, this proposal only concerns the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains, as these two chains are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be interpreted as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject over in Arbitrum ArbOS upgrades [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\nPlease note that ArbOS Version 40 “Callisto” is a proposed upgrade that builds upon ArbOS version 32 which has been previously adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 40 instead of 33 due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability as explained [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/arbos-upgrade#step-3-schedule-the-arbos-version-upgrade).\n\n## Changes that will be included in ArbOS 40 Callisto:\n\n### [EIP-7702: Set EOA Account code ](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)\n\nEIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to set executable code adding account-abstraction functionality to EOAs such as delegation, batching, sponsorship, and privilege de-escalation. In terms of batching, multiple operations can be combined (ex. token approval, token spend) in an atomic transaction. Transaction sponsorship or paymaster support can also be extended to EOAs. Discrete permissioning can also be enabled with the use of sub-keys.\n\n### [EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)\n\nThis EIP introduces precompiles for performing cryptographic operations on the [BLS12-381 curve](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/) and focuses on enhancing the efficiency and security of those operations. This cryptographic primitive unlocks 120+ bits of security for operations over the pairing-friendly curves, compared to the existing BN254 precompile which only provides 80 bits of security. BLS signature verification is the primary use case for this EIP, though many other applications that rely on point additions, multiplications, and pairing operations stand to gain from this proposal; examples are zkSNARKS, cross-chain interactions, randomness beacons, and vector commitments.\n\n### [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)\n\nThis EIP proposes storing a wider window of block hashes in the storage of a dedicated system contract. Bundling historical block hashes within the state enables efficient data retrieval for applications that require extended access to historical block hashes, like stateless clients. If approved, ArbOS 40 will adapt this EIP to the L2 and store the same number of L2 block hashes that are generated in the time it takes for 8192 L1 blocks to be built - this is approximately 27 hours worth of L2 block hashes.\n\nMinor Stylus fix to correct caching behavior for contracts that do not exist\n\n### Minor Stylus fix to correct caching behavior for contracts that do not exist\n\nCurrently, Stylus will cache results from calling account_code and account_code_size for a contract that does not exist. We would like to propose a fix to address this so that the call returns the correct information that properly reflects the latest state of the contract’s code or code size. This change will not increment the Stylus version and so a re-activation of already-deployed Stylus contracts will not be required.\n\n## Pectra changes that are not included in the proposed ArbOS 40 Callisto Upgrade\n\nSupport and implementation for the following EIPs are not planned to be part of ArbOS 40 Callisto:\n\n* All Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) Pectra changes (EIP-6610, EIP-7002, EIP-7251, EIP-7549, EIP-7691) because Arbitrum chains do not have a beacon chain and therefore do not have a peer-to-peer layer like Ethereum does.\n* [EIP-7623: Increase calldata cost](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623): because block size variance is less of a concern on Arbitrum chains. This is because of two reasons. First, Arbitrum chains do not require nodes to send blocks over the network through its peer-to-peer layer and instead rely on the parent chain’s RPC to retrieve block data. Secondly, because Arbitrum block sizes are already limited to ~100KB and so increasing calldata cost is not expected to reduce Arbitrum block sizes.\n* [EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685): because Arbitrum chains do not have a beacon chain and, therefore, there is nothing to request from the EL on Arbitrum chains.\n* [EIP-7840: Add blob schedule to EL configuration files](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840): because Arbitrum chains do not support posting blobs on the rollup (but otherwise still does support posting blobs to Ethereum L1).\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nMore detailed information about the specific implementation and versions will be provided closer to the date of the formal on-chain Tally vote. However, this proposal will roughly follow the below steps:\n\n1. An AIP outlining the proposed upgrade and specification is proposed to the ArbitrumDAO Forum for discussion (this post)\n2. A temperature check vote is held on Snapshot\n3. Engineering work to scope out and implement the relevant changes for ArbOS 40 Callisto into the Nitro node software, relevant rollup contracts, and associated upgrade actions (this work has already begun).\n4. A security audit of all ArbOS 40 relevant changes is conducted by a third-party (Trail of Bits) and the audit report is published for public consumption.\n5. A new version of Nitro and nitro-contracts is released that support ArbOS 40 Callisto.\n6. Should the Snapshot vote pass, then ArbOS 40 Callisto will be deployed to both private devnets & Arbitrum Sepolia for testing.\n7. A formal AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote.\n8. If the Tally vote passes, ArbOS 40 Callisto will be activated on Arbitrum One and on Arbitrum Nova following the required waiting periods and phases, as outlined in the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution for a Constitutional AIP](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal).\n\n### **Note on Pectra hard fork timelines:**\n\nSimilar to the [ArbOS 20 Atlas upgrade](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos20) and the [Ethereum Dencun hard fork](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/02/27/dencun-mainnet-announcement) in March 2024, the activation timestamp for ArbOS 40 Callisto will be targeted for roughly the same timestamp as when Ethereum Mainnet hard forks. At the time of writing and as of the latest [All Core Devs Consensus (ACDC) Call #150 held on Feb 6th, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-150-february-6-2025/22703), the timestamp of the Ethereum Mainnet fork for Pectra is targeted for April 8, 2025. The tentative dates for Ethereum Holesky and Ethereum Sepolia to upgrade to Pectra are Feb 24, 2025 and March 5, 2025, respectively. The exact slot for mainnet Ethereum is expected to be chosen on March 6, 2025.\n\nGiven that the L1 client teams are planning to release their Pectra-supported versions by Feb 13, 2025 and that the required steps for a [Constitutional AIP can take up to ~41.4 days](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal) (not including engineering and audit), there is a strong likelihood that ArbOS 40 Callisto will be activated on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova after Ethereum Mainnet upgrades to Pectra (if the ArbitrumDAO votes to adopt this proposal). We will endeavor to keep this proposal updated as timelines become more concrete.",

        "body": "Request Non-Emergency Security Council Action\nAbstract\nThe transaction fee paid by users is composed of two parts, L2 fees and L1 fees, which together include the execution cost for running the transaction on Arbitrum alongside the cost of posting data to Ethereum (to learn more about this, read the deep dive on the subject 1).\n\nHistorically, the rollup fee market has been dominated by the L1 cost component. With the Dencun upgrade soon being enabled on Ethereum, the current pricing structure may no longer be optimal. The ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade is a step towards better consuming the new data availability affordances offered by Ethereum, but will also potentially require further adjustment once EIP-4844 has been deployed and tested.\n\nThere was an oversight during the ArbOS Version 20 “Atlas” upgrade where two configuration should be updated for users when the Dencun upgrade occurs:\n\nL1 surplus fee. Reduce the surplus fee per byte from 32 gwei to 0.\nL2 base fee. Reduce the minimum from 0.1 gwei to 0.01 gwei.\nIn both cases, the configuration changes will match what is currently implemented in Arbitrum Nova. As evidenced by the recent surge of transactions in Arbitrum Nova, the network can handle the increased transaction throughput while offering lower fees for users in general under that configuration.\n\nImpact on the ArbitrumDAO’s revenue\nThe L2 base fee change will impact the revenue received by the ArbitrumDAO. The potential impact based on the past 30 days of activity was calculated, which if the changes had been implemented (ignoring potential changes in demand based on lower fees), would have resulted in overall profit going from 816.13 ETH → 79.89 ETH\n\nWhile the fee reduction will result in lower revenue for the ArbitrumDAO in the short term, it will ensure that the Arbitrum One network continues to offer competitive costs to its users and in turn it can lead to an increase in transaction traffic.\n\nSince the parameter change affects the revenue generated, it is important to carry out a temperature check for the ArbitrumDAO to discuss and ultimately vote on the change. If it is approved by the ArbitrumDAO, then the Security Council will be requested to initiate a non-emergency action to execute the configuration change. The goal is to ensure the fees are changed as soon as possible in line with the Decun upgrade.\n\nImplementation details\nThe following configured values will be changed in the ArbOwner smart contract that can be viewed in Contract Address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000006b | Arbiscan.\n\nThe following governance action smart contracts will be used to initiate the action:\n\nArbOneSetAtlasL1PricingRewardAction | Address 0x36D0170D92F66e8949eB276C3AC4FEA64f83704d | Arbiscan\nArbOneSetAtlasMinBaseFeeAction | Address 0x849E360a247132F961c9CBE95Ba39106c72e1268 | Arbiscan\nThe security council will separate the two parameter change actions to enable the ArbitrumDAO to decide whether to accept one, both, or neither. The ability to decide will be reflected on Snapshot using a ranked voting with the following options:\n\nSet L1 surplus fee and L2 minimum base fee.\nSet only L1 surplus fee.\nSet only L2 minimum base fee.\nSet neither option and cancel security council action.\nTimeline\nThe ArbOS v20 “Atlas” upgrade is due to be activated on the 14th of March, and the following schedule will be pursued to address the configuration issues in a timely manner:\n\n5th March - Temperature Vote on Snapshot\n5th March - Initiate non-emergency security council action\n18th March - Activate configuration change to reduce fees\nA non-emergency security council action is viewed as ideal as it exists primarily to approve and implement routine software upgrades, routine maintenance and other parameter adjustments in a non-emergency setting.\n\nTemperature check: Snapshot 3\nSecurity council transaction: [update shortly]\n\nTaking this route will mean that Arbitrum One network will have higher than anticipated fees for 5 days.\n\nThe following governance calls will also enable the community to discuss the technical changes:\n\n6th March - Wednesday at 6pm EST\n7th March - Thursday at 9am EST\nBoth calls will be added to the governance call and more calls can be arranged if necessary.",

        "title": "[Constitutional] AIP: Constitutional Quorum Threshold Reduction",
        "author": "0xd333Bc5c9670C9cEb18f9A2CF02C6E86807a8227",
        "body": "# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes a reduction of the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5%, lowering it from 5% to 4.5% of the [total Arbitrum votable tokens](https://dune.com/queries/4629041/7761813). The goal is to ensure that well-supported proposals can successfully conclude by aligning quorum requirements with current levels of voter participation, reducing the risk of legitimate initiatives failing due to quorum thresholds not being met.\n\nFor non-constitutional proposals, the existing 3% quorum threshold will remain unchanged.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past year, the 5% quorum threshold for constitutional proposals within the ArbitrumDAO has been challenging, despite support from a broad range of delegates. As the circulating supply of $ARB continues to grow and voter turnout remains relatively flat, quorum requirements are becoming increasingly difficult to meet. \n[ARDC research on governance risks analysis](https://loving-bank-303.notion.site/Part-2-Governance-Risks-Analysis-1b605ac99aec80c282c7fa0105f13ce7) suggest that quorum on constitutional proposals could reach 300M (in base case) in about a year, while participation rate as % of votable supply has gone down from 8% in early 2024 to 4-5% in early 2025. Reducing the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5% provides a short-term adjustment that enables critical governance to move forward while longer-term reforms are considered and developed.\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nArbitrumDAO is governed by the principles of decentralization, participation, and credible neutrality. This proposal balances those principles by modestly reducing the constitutional quorum threshold to better reflect the current governance environment without undermining the legitimacy of approved proposals. This proposal also would not require any upgrades to existing smart contracts, helping maintain community trust and operational simplicity.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction was selected as a conservative adjustment that is expected to meaningfully improve the likelihood of well-supported proposals reaching quorum, while still maintaining a high enough threshold to deter governance attacks.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Constitutional Proposal: A type of proposal within the ArbitrumDAO that modifies governance structures outlined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. These require higher quorum thresholds than non-Constitutional proposals.\n\n* Quorum: The minimum number of tokens required to participate in voting for a proposal to be valid and eligible to pass. In this context, it is calculated as a percentage of the total $ARB votable tokens.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal updates the constitutional quorum threshold from 5% of the total votable tokens to 4.5%.\n\nAs of April 2025, with ~4.3B ARB in votable tokens (formula is total supply of ARB token, which is 10B, minus the amount delegated to the [exclude address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b86)), the quorum reduction would decrease the requirement by approximately 25 million ARB tokens, bringing the effective quorum from ~215M to ~190M ARB.\n\nNo upgrades to core governance smart contracts are required. Instead, this proposal will include an action contract that uses existing functionality to modify the quorum constant used in the calculation of constitutional quorum thresholds. The action contract will need to be audited, and this is expected to take 1 day.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction represents a minimal-risk, fast-to-implement interim solution, while other long-term solutions can be considered, such as flexible quorum, or franchiser contract.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal will follow these steps:\n\n1. Forum discussion: This AIP is posted to the ArbitrumDAO forum for discussion and feedback from the community. [DONE]\n2. Temperature Check: An informal offchain vote is conducted on Snapshot to gauge community support. [ON-GOING]\n3. On-Chain Vote: A formal Constitutional AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote. This proposal itself will be subject to the existing 5% quorum to pass.\n4. Update Governance Parameters: If passed, the new 4.5% quorum requirement would take effect immediately for all future constitutional proposals.\n\nNo smart contract changes or audits are required, which reduces implementation complexity and cost.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThis AIP does not request any grant or budget allocation. It introduces no operational, technical, or recurring costs and does not require smart contract upgrades or audits. Governance configuration changes are handled via on-chain proposal execution and incur only the standard gas costs associated with DAO transactions.",

        "title": "[Pyth Network] Arbitrum LTIPP Extension Request",
        "author": "0xB933AEe47C438f22DE0747D57fc239FE37878Dd1",
        "body": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks a 12 weeks extension (until November 30\\) of the Pyth Network’s [previously approved LTIPP grant](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003).\n\nInitially, the Pyth Network was allocated 1,000,000 ARB through the LTIPP process. To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.\n\nWe are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.\n\nFor existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20).\n\nThanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14\\.\n\nBefore the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.\n\nPyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.\n\nThe request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.\n\nThis strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.\n\nIt’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nFurthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nThis proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx\n\n# Specifications\n\n* 13 weeks duration  \n* 175,000 ARB\n\nThe proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.\n\nThis increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.\n\nAs during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525), and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.\n\nSince this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.\n\nIf approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.\n\nThe proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThe cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.\n\nWe are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWe have been actively seeking feedback and advice from [@Matt_StableLab](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_stablelab) to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.\n\nOur interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10).\n\nCurrently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.\n\nPlease note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.",

        "author": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD",
        "body": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power \n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay \n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1) The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n2. The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n\nIncreasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n\nOn the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n2) The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n\n3) The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 6 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n**RFC -** January 11th to January 18th\n\n**Snapshot -** January 18th to January 25th\n\n**On-Chain Vote:** January 30th to February 13th\n\n**Execution Delay:**\n\n- February 13th to February 16th - L2 Waiting Period\n- February 16th to February 23rd - L2-to-L1 Message\n- February 23rd to February 27th - L1 Waiting Period\n\n**Please note the aforementioned timeline is tentative and the actual timeline might be slightly different.**",
