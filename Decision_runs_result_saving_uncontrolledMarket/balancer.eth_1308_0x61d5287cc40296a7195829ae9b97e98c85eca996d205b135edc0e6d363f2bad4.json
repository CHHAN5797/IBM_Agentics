It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development. This proposal deals with the Administrative and Operational (Admin & Ops) element of the OpCo. It has been discussed in detail in this [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Admin & Ops should be considered as a part of this proposal.\n\nThe Product Development element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal.\n\n## Administrative & Operations\n\nServing as the operating entity with which third-party Service Providers to the Balancer DAO will contract, submit invoices to, and from which they will be paid whether that be in fiat or in tokens. This role is integral to the decentralised operations of the Balancer ecosystem, and in practice supports the healthy long term functioning of the DAO and the Balancer Protocol, and helps the DAO achieve its goals.\n\nThe Balancer OpCo will operate under the direction of the Balancer Foundation, which will oversee / have responsibility for governance, corporate administration and operations. This includes hosting and managing software subscriptions and login credentials for the OpCo team and certain ecosystem-wide platforms and social media accounts. An addition for year two is in-house Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that the Ecosystem Council proposes be retained by OpCo as a new addition to the OpCo budget. As a reminder, the Foundation operates under the governance of the DAO.\n\nA little more on GRC: given their experience with the Balancer Ecosystem, we are proposing Warburton continue this role. Hours are reduced under this proposed budget. In terms of scope, Warburton will provide GRC advice to support the [Balancer Ecosystem Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409) which includes major service providers (SPs). Warburton will provide reporting to the Ecosystem Council as requested and protect confidentiality so Balancer has the ability to defend itself from unnecessary disclosure in litigation or government inquiries.\n\nGRC services will be focused on protecting the resiliency, and facilitating the growth, of the ecosystem through the Council members (and major SPs). GRC efforts will protect Balancer by focusing on further decentralization strategy and implementation, US regulatory risks and Balancer objectives to understand and proactively protect against potential threats from legal/regulatory changes. GRC will also include keeping the Ecosystem Council current on matters of regulatory changes and sentiment, monitoring the GRC program including review of marketing/comms, conflicts of interest, VASP, sanctions and exemptions/exclusions from other evolving global requirements, assessment and negotiation of material contracts for disclosed council members and SPs and management of regulatory inquiries, investigations and/or litigation and strategy for Ecosystem Council with external counsel as needed. GRC will be handled “in-house” to extent practical to minimize external counsel costs and time. Please note that this is an internal facing role that will report to the Ecosystem Council including OpCo, not directly to the DAO. The scope of hours may be expanded to cover needs as pre-approved by OpCo. Warburton would operate on a 30-day notice period.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nOne year - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through June 2024 (Q2 FY24) divided into four quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be returned to the Balancer Treasury, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal or other SPs.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![opco1.png](ipfs://bafkreiftgnzjubhz7bobic73bm46y7tsnkazaj6dxrupm53gpq4ctzf4x4)\n    \n\n### Requests for USDC transfers:\n\nThe OpCo holds funds due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3. We propose that USDC funding needs for OpCo be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the twelve months of the OpCo budget based on current information.\n\nQ3 FY23 - USDC 76,379 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ4 FY23 - USDC 55,979 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ1 FY24 - USDC 61,991 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ2 FY24 - USDC 55,989 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nAdmin & Ops has no BAL requirements.\n\n### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe projected spend associated with this proposal (and that of the Product Development Team for a possible 9-month proposal) can both be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.\n\nFor objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 4% of combined current unallocated OpCo funds and current Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).\n\n### Non-People Costs - Operations & Administration\n\nThe main items in this section are legal and compliance costs (more below), monthly bookkeeping service (we continue to perform the “CFO” element in house for the foreseeable future in order to keep costs down). We have included a $20,000 estimate in Q3 for Directors and Officers insurance - actual costs could be materially different. Software subscriptions included here are for operations (G-suite, QBO) and ecosystem-wide services such as Dune Analytics, Discourse, Slack, Notion and Asana. Q3 2023 includes a one-off amount of $10,000 in case a deposit is required for a new bank account.\n\nThe largest increase relates to in-house Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that the Ecosystem Council proposes be retained by OpCo as a new addition to the OpCo budget, effective 1 August, 2023. As mentioned, we are proposing Warburton continue this role. Hours are reduced under this budget compared with year one, to a fixed monthly fee of $10,500, or $115,500 for 11 months. If this needs to be revisited it will be dealt with in a future proposal.\n\nThe total amount sought for Non-people costs, Operations and Administration is USDC 250,338. Broken down by category:\n\n* Administrative costs: USDC 11,800 - Registered Office/Agent, Registrar of Companies Fees, Annual Compliance Services, Bank fees, Gas fees, hardware wallet if needed.\n\n* Directors’ and Officers’ insurance: USDC 20,000 (estimate)\n\n* Establishment of new banks account(s): USDC 10,000 (estimate)\n\n* Internal GRC - total for the year (11 months in this case) USDC 115,500. This represents the minimum internal GRC support required for the items mentioned in the proposal - that is - the day-to-day of the operations. To keep the budget lean, we have removed the proposed buffer budget that was in the previous draft. \n\nThe fixed part of the proposed GRC amount represents 20 hours per month (roughly 5 hours per week) at USCC 525 per hour. This is the USDC 10.5k per month. For baseline, Warburton is currently contracted to Balancer at 20 hours per week (not through OpCo) and is fully occupied. This budget is a 75% reduction in time, and therefore yet to be seen how it works. We have edited this proposal to remove the buffer, and will raise a specific proposal should the need arise on a specific matter.\n\nThere is a cost benefit of having someone experienced that can cover multiple issues, jurisdictions, entities and topics - for illustration one person’s hourly rates vs having multiple specialists and having two or more lawyers on a call, all charging per hour. With this proposed arrangement, GRC would support the Foundation, OpCo, B Labs, Beets, Maxis and other members of Ecosystem Council as well as major SPs. This resource would not just be dedicated to providing services to one entity.\n\n* The estimate for external GRC is USDC 24,000 for the year. \n\n* Bookkeeping / Accounting services estimated at USDC 24,000 for the year (USDC 2,000 per month). This also is a very low budget given industry comparables, but we are hopeful of achieving this.\n\n* Software services for the Ecosystem and OpCo administration USDC 45,038\n\n# ETH Address to Receive Funds:\n\nNot necessary as this proposal can be covered by funds currently held at the Balancer OpCo.\n\n# Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this is internal / for the OpCo itself.",

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/334)\n\nAuthored by: @gareth & @Tristan345\n\n# Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nThis proposal deals with the Product Development element housed in the OpCo. The initial discussion is at [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Product should be considered as a part of this proposal. This proposal has been adapted to incorporate feedback from that forum discussion and includes more details around the evolution from Front-end and Design to a more holistic Product model. In particular, a Product Vision section has been added and the Goals section has been updated to align our work more closely with protocol objectives. The proposal period has been reduced from 12 months to 9 months, and the budget has been tightened.\n\nFor reference, the Administrative and Operations element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923).\n\nThe revised proposal for Product seeks approval for 723,525 USDC, compared with 1,139,544 USDC for the previous version. The table below shows the bridge between the previous proposal budget and the revised proposal. Reducing the period to 9 months cut the forecast by 316k USDC down to 824k USDC. This also reduces the BAL request from 38,020.83 BAL to 28,958.33 BAL. We have further trimmed the proposal by 100k USDC to a final figure of 724k USDC.\n\n \n![bip351-1.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvwwaoop35udm3bqga4nnd6vir45n4kfwcymhnwe5t7bw3mxmri)\n    \n\nThe $100k reduction for the 9-month period comprises:\n\n* Dropping the FX buffer for non-USD payroll from 5% to 3%. Note that I have updated the FX rates from the mid buy/sell on xe.com to the rate used by the payroll provider in June, which moves against us slightly.\n* Cutting the allowance for unconfirmed increases in January of up to 5% down to 0%.\n* Cutting the payroll buffer for variances from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working, and hardware to zero.\n* Cutting the budget for TRM API calls of $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.\n\n# Product Development Workstream\n\nThis section has been removed from snapshot to adhere to the max. Character limit. Read about the full details on the forum.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nNine months - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through March 2024 (Q1 FY24) divided into three quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these three quarters. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be available to the DAO, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal.\n\nWe note that the Product team are employees/contractors under OpCo. Should DAO Governance vote to restructure the Product team, for example, change who maintains the front-end or for OpCo to cease hosting the front-end, OpCo policy is to provide staff severance equal to the requirements of local labour law in their jurisdiction, subject to a minimum of one month’s notice.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![bip351-2.png](ipfs://bafkreidscjaz2kkqlxc43hzv2orkewcycoswtzve5p7uxbje2ij5ndxrla)\n    \n\nA breakdown of the Product Dev People costs is here:\n\n \n![bip351-3.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvr76puowmubfmhlobuiegc5m5ponjpckhmmttdcdicqoch5ksi)\n    \n\n### Requests for USDC:\n\nThe OpCo holds funds saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3 FY23. We propose that USDC funding needs for Product be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the nine months of the Product proposal.\n\nQ3 FY23 - USDC 240,744 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ4 FY23 - USDC 241,975 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ1 FY24 - USDC 240,775 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nQ3 FY23 - 28,958.33 BAL - for transfer after the snapshot vote, if successful.\n\n### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe projected spend associated with this proposal can be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb from year 1, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.\n\nFor objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 12.3% of combined current unallocated funds at OpCo, and current DAO Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).\n\n### People Costs - Product\n\nPeople Costs are comprised of remuneration and employment costs for the developers. Remuneration is currently denominated in USD, AUD, GBP, and EUR. Exchange rate fluctuations against the US Dollar will impact the actual results. We have built a 3% buffer on FX rates.\n\nThere is also a buffer to cover small unexpected variances in employment costs. As mentioned, this has been cut from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working and hardware to zero. Any unused amounts will either be rolled into the next funding proposal or returned to the DAO.\n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting 28,958.33 BAL for the nine-month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. These BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 4-year vesting period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff, or return to the DAO Treasury.\n\n### Non-People Costs - Product\n\nNon-People Costs Product consists of software subscriptions to front-end development tools and TRM. These costs have reduced significantly from year one. New additions to the cost structure relate to the design element, proposed to be housed in OpCo from 1 August 2023.\n\nAlchemy is the largest line item at $2,945 per month or $35,340 for the period. The TRM annual subscription runs until May 2024. The annual renewal (est $30k) is outside the period of this proposal and is therefore excluded. In addition, the team is cutting the budget for TRM API calls from $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.\n\nThese and the other software costs depend on certain variables, including, for example, the number of users, log-ins, number of entities in the community that have access, and service calls. Some are billed monthly and others quarterly or annually, hence the changes in costs from one quarter to the next. We have estimated these figures using the best information available as of now, and recognise there will likely be variances during the year as more accurate data becomes available and actual costs become known. The team continues to monitor the usage of these services in order to reduce fees, and where possible negotiate more favourable rates - noting that material negotiations were undertaken in year one that we continue to reap the benefits of.\n\n# ETH Address to Receive BAL:\n\n0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693, a multisig controlled by the Balancer OpCo.\n\n# Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this entity is internal.

        "body": "# Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves three primary functions: (1) Administrative and Operational; (2) housing Ecosystem and Protocol infrastructure; and (3) Product Development.\n\nThe OpCo budget is approved until the end of June 2024 under [[BIP-349]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-349-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-administrative-and-operational-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923). This proposal deals with changes to the Administrative and Operational (Admin & Ops) element of the OpCo, that goes hand and hand with the Foundation, seeking additional budget allocation to shift personnel currently being funded in [the Maxis](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420) and services previously budgeted under the [Product](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927) team.\n\nThe changes introduced this quarter present cost-savings opportunities to the ecosystem as a whole, reducing the Treasury’s burn rate. For full reference, please refer to these funding proposals from this round:\n\n* [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-year-three-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/5627)\n* [Maxis](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2024/5625)\n* [OpCo (product)](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-fund-opco-product-team-april-sept/5617)\n\n### Protocol Infrastructure\n\nThese are third party services that are used throughout the ecosystem and are critical to the ongoing operation of the protocol and DAO’s infrastructure. It made sense to show them separately from the Product proposal, where they were previously reported under “Non-People Costs”. They include RPC providers, domain hosting, Gitbook and Github, cloud storage and many other essential tools and services to the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nNon-People Costs related to Protocol Infrastructure have now been removed from the Product budget, and shown [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-fund-opco-product-team-april-sept/5617). This proposal allocates them more correctly for a better overview of costs, both of the product team and the broader Balancer protocol ecosystem.\n\nNote that this is supplementary to the ecosystem subscriptions/services that were already accounted for in OpCo’s Year 2 funding on [[BIP-349]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-349-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-administrative-and-operational-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923#impact-on-the-treasury-8).\n\n### Operations\n\nFrom Q2/24, the responsibilities of the Foundation’s CEO (to be deprecated) are being proposed in the Foundation [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-year-three-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/5627) to be handed over to @Danko8383 as a service provider for operations and administration at the direction of the board, also bringing over other ecosystem-wide domains of operations currently under the scope of the [Balancer Maxis](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420).\n\nSuch tasks on these domains are often delegated to community contributors knighted as “Ballers”. By doing so, the DAO incentivizes organic community engagement and decentralized contributions on general inquiries, moderation and user support. These activities are intrinsically related to the protocol infrastructure and ecosystem, which corroborates to the cost-center shift as well.\n\nThe Ballers are currently being held on the following domains, living under the Balancer Maxis umbrella to fulfill tasks under Danko’s leadership:\n\n5. Community Engagement\n\n* Managing community interactions\n* Discord user support\n* Balancer weekly report ([Newsletter](https://medium.com/@balancer.ballers))\n* Governance report (weekly Twitter posts)\n\n7. Outreach and Anti-Scam Oversight (see latest report [here](https://dubstard.com/Balancer/February2024/))\n\n* Leading efforts against scam activities within the Balancer ecosystem.\n* Pen-testing of security infrastructure\n* Take down of scam sites\n\n## Accounting and Bookkeeping\n\nFrom [[BIP-349]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-349-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-administrative-and-operational-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923#impact-on-the-treasury-8), the Balancer OpCo allocated $2,000 USD/month for accounting and bookkeeping. This budget was never used in full, seeing some cost-saving opportunities driven by GroundWorks and a bookkeeper taking on this role. This approach worked during the market down-cycle, but is not sustainable going forward.\n\nTo further decentralize the DAO, the OpCo is contracting with [Lemma](https://www.lemma.solutions/), an accounting firm based in the Cayman Islands specialized in DAO services. This will also bring more substance to the activities in our current jurisdiction, given the ops/admin will be outsourced elsewhere.\n\nDuring commercial negotiations, Lemma has agreed to take a portion of payments in BAL allocations, on a proportion of 4/1 ($1600 USDC and $400 worth in liquid BAL tokens), signaling they’re alignment with Balancer’s success, showing no intention of selling in the short-term.\n\nThis budget projects the spending is USD, while also accounting for a supplement of $500 USD for extraordinary hours and a professional bookkeeper.\n\n## Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards\n\nYES\n\n## Length of Engagement & Budget: Q2’24\n\nThe proposed budget for this quarter supplements the allocations made in BIP-349 (ruling from Q3’23 to Q2’24)\n\n$46,414 for non-people costs (Protocol Infrastructure);\n$12,000 + 750 BAL to be locked/vested (Ballers);\n$1,500 for accounting and bookkeeping;\n\nTotal supplement for Q2’24: 59,914.00 USDC + 750 BAL\n\n## Impact on the Treasury\n\nBalancer OpCo holds enough USDC and BAL to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by SPs vs their original budgets. For that reason, no token transfer is required from the DAO for this proposal.\n\nThe table below summarizes where costs were previously budgeted, and where they are now being proposed. In addition, the changes proposed by the restructuring will introduce $76,716 USD annualized net savings to the DAO (based on current projections):\n\n \n![bip-567-1.png](ipfs://bafkreigrwznk3blqr7kaqwwfuwcyt7kwwzgabfl4a55tejcjko5jmifnry)\n    \n\n## ETH Address to Receive Funds:\n\nNot necessary as this proposal can be covered by funds currently held at the Balancer OpCo.\n\n## Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this is internal / for the OpCo itself.",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the funding of the Balancer Foundation for year three.\n\nAs a recap, the Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work in a decentralized environment, and supports resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate. It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts, and is able to take certain actions that a DAO is unable to perform on its own behalf.\n\nThe Foundation and its operating subsidiary (Balancer OpCo Limited) act as facilitators of the Balancer Ecosystem. This governance structure, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, the front-end team or other technology providers.\n\nIn short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the DAO and part of the DAO’s governance within the structure of the traditional business world.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.\n\n# Specification - Foundation expenses and reserves\n\nThe budget identified for the Foundation is line-item specific and includes very few estimates. The Foundation has, however, assisted in achieving meaningful savings elsewhere in the ecosystem, mainly by optimizing costs across many different service providers.\n\nThe Foundation’s independent Cayman director reviewed these projections in comparison with a number of foundations similar portfolio to the Balancer Foundation, and sees the Balancer Foundation achieving a material cost saving overall with its proposed figures.\n\nThis proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2024 running through March 2025. This proposal does not request any change to the self-insurance reserve, currently covered by the approval of [BIP-198](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409).\n\n## Foundation Expenses\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, and introduces a few changes to our Cayman/BVI structure without compromising our footprint in these jurisdictions, significantly reducing our USDC burn.\n\nThe current CEO (Tristan Relly) has given notice and the Foundation Board, with support from team leaders in the Ecosystem-Council, has identified @Danko8383 to perform the operational and administrative roles for both the Foundation and Balancer OpCo, deprecating the “CEO” title.\n\nDanko is a seasoned Balancer community member, part of the Balancer Maxis and has been a Director on the Foundation Board since Dec 2022. From Q2 and beyond, this proposal would also see other daily operational duties of the DAO (currently held from within the Maxis) move into the Foundation/OpCo setup, reallocating this scope of work (see more on the Maxis funding proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2024/5625));\n\nIn order to replace Tristan Relly’s signing authority in the Cayman Islands, the board has carried out discussions with independent directors based in the Cayman Islands, and would like to propose that the Foundation retain the services of an additional professional director provided by Leeward Management Limited (“Leeward”) that is being offered at a competitive price. The budget includes an element of operational and legal support for the Foundation on a monthly basis. Leeward and their personnel are drawn from recognized industry professions, are experienced in governance and compliance matters for Cayman Islands foundation companies, and act for many leading projects and some of the largest DAOs. This particular candidate has a legal background that will be useful to the Foundation well in reviewing legal contracts.\n\nThe Foundation Board proposes that the appointment is effective immediately on the conclusion of voting should the proposal pass. According to article 5.3 of Balancer’s Foundation Articles of Association: “The Token Holders have the power, by Governance Resolution, to appoint or remove Directors.”\n\nBoard meetings held on-site in the Cayman Islands are also accounted for in the budget, given last epoch’s were paid from savings. The meetings with a totality/majority of the members present are considered a great advantage for jurisdictional substance.\n\nIf approved, we propose that year three be funded from funds already held by Balancer OpCo due to savings achieved there, rather than additional funding from the DAO. If budget changes are requested, they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.\n\nThe Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, and one will see annual fees due around December/January that lead to higher funding needs in those quarters. The year two budget accounted for two years worth of annual fees and professional director's fees due to the timing of payments. That was a one-off and now the budget aligns with those payments once a year.\n\n \n![bip-566-1.png](ipfs://bafybeih7eugdbewp5tvybhddvtezyere76nouepmyjznssklxuqrggncqm)\n    \n\n# Detail\n\nFor reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.\n\n### Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)\n\nAnnual registered office and registrar fee (US$3,207.00). These fees are due in January each year and are based on current figures, with a 10% uplift. Includes:\n\n- providing the registered office and registered agent\n- maintaining the statutory registers\n- preparation and submission of annual returns\n- filing economic substance notifications\n- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same\n\n### Annual Secretary Fee\n\nUnder Cayman Law, a Foundation Company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). These fees are due in January each year and are based on current figures, with a 10% uplift.\n\nNeither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise (see “Legal Counsel” below).\n\n### Legal Counsel\n\nThe Foundation may seek counsel on matters of Cayman law and industry standards as they evolve. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to an additional Cayman legal team rather than the in-house service team.\n\nAny additional corporate requests (e.g. requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc) are here included as a buffer and will also be charged separately.\n\nTentatively, if the budget is available, the Foundation will seek counsel regarding MiCA developments in Europe and tax legislation, focusing on U.S. fiscal and regulatory overreach.\n\n### Governance/Supervisory Services\n\n#### Director and Supervisor Responsibilities\n\nUnder the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.\n\n“Supervisor”, for a Foundation Company, means a person, other than a member, who under the Foundation Company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.\n\nThe non-executive Director responsibilities are:\n\n* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors\n* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation\n* To work with the wider board of directors to:\n  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;\n  * set an agenda for board meetings;\n  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate\n* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate\n* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission\n* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary\n* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director\n\nThe contracted fees for these services are in line with industry standard, and less than certain providers. The fees are due in full in January each year.\n\nIn this present proposal, as presented above, the Foundation is budgeting for the appointment of a 4th Director to the board in replacement to Tristan Relly, allocating a maximum of 5 hours/mo (hourly charges incurred per hour capped), which should be sufficient for the Board needs.\n\n#### Community Board Member duties\n\nThe Directors have ultimate responsibility for the oversight of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:\n\n* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require\n\n* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;\n\n* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;\n\n* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;\n\nThe contracted fees for these services are in line with industry standard, and less than certain providers. The fees are due quarterly.\n\n#### Operational and administrative duties\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is currently responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation.\n\nFrom Q2/24, the Foundation Board has identified these responsibilities to be handed over to @Danko as a service provider for operations and administration at the direction of the board, accumulating other ecosystem-wide domains of operations, currently under the scope of the [Balancer Maxis](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420), taking the Ballers (community contributor) inside the OpCo subsidiary.\n\nThe cost-center shift will see an increase in Danko’s monthly compensation due to increased responsibilities, specially being a go-to signatory for the Foundation/OpCo while also acting behalf of the DAO, carrying a portion of his locked BAL package (1.2k BAL/quarter). Danko is a seasoned Balancer community member, having support from team leaders in the ecosystem-council to take on this responsibility (see detailed below). The changes introduced here and other restructuring proposals, account for most of the introduced cost savings to the DAO as a whole, reducing the Treasury’s burn rate.\n\nThe handover role of day-to-day management currently carried by the Foundation’s CEO (to be deprecated), includes:\n\n1. Liaising with the board on budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary\n* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, program operations, employee matters,\n* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance regarding the carrying out of the Foundation’s purpose under its Memorandum and Articles.\n\n2. Manage Finances and Service Providers\n\n* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.\n* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.\n* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord).\n* Contracts with BVI for service providers.\n* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account\n* Setting up and managing token custodian for the Foundation\n* As directed, overseeing vendors as needed.\n\n3. Compliance\n\n* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters.\n\n4. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.\n\nUnder the Balancer Maxis, Danko is carrying the following domains and tasks with the assistance of the Ballers:\n\n5. Community Engagement\n\n* Managing community interactions\n* Onboarding new contributors and service providers\n* Planning ecosystem meetups and events (ONsites) and handling logistical arrangements\n* Discord user support\n* Balancer weekly report (newsletter)\n* Governance report (Twitter)\n\n6. DAO Treasury and Risk Management\n\n* Overseeing budget, payments, and financial transactions.\n* Due diligence for new service providers.\n* Risk inventory and assessment with GRC\n\n7. Outreach and Anti-Scam Oversight\n\n* Leading efforts against scam activities within the Balancer ecosystem.\n* Pen-testing of security infrastructure\n* Take down of scam sites\n* Services and subscriptions admin (Discord, Notion, etc.).\n\nSee the supplementary budget proposal for the Ballers at the Balancer OpCo [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628).\n\n## Software, hosting, admin\n\nExpenses for day to day operations, including payment processor fee (crypto credit card, off-ramp solutions, banks etc.) and accounting software for bookkeeping (Xero)\n\n# Impact on the Treasury\n\nBalancer Foundation/OpCo holds enough USDC and BAL to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by SPs v. their original budgets. For that reason, no token transfer is required from the DAO for this proposal.\n\nThe table below summarizes where costs were previously budgeted, and where they are now being proposed. In addition, the changes proposed by the restructuring will introduce $76,716 USD annualized net savings to the DAO (based on current projections):\n\n \n![bip-566-2.png](ipfs://bafkreigrwznk3blqr7kaqwwfuwcyt7kwwzgabfl4a55tejcjko5jmifnry)\n    \n\n## ETH Address to Receive Funds:\n\nNot necessary as this proposal can be covered by funds currently held at the Balancer OpCo.\n\n## Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this is internal / for the OpCo itself.",

        "author": "0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3",
        "body": "Authoured by: Tristan, Mkflow#7938, Xeonus#4620, Gareth and Tim.\n\n## Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x05d36e7cb6f2f63ac84eb279ff7bb274eb6375a81429edc77655212c79d6d0ae) corporate structure supporting the BalancerDAO, and is intended to serve two primary functions:\n\n### Administrative & Operational\n\nServing as the operating entity with which third-party Service Providers to the BalancerDAO will contract, submit invoices to, and from which they will be paid whether that be in fiat or in tokens. This role is integral to the decentralized operations of the Balancer ecosystem, and in practice has to be in place for the healthy long term functioning of the DAO and the Balancer Protocol. The Balancer OpCo is also intended to host certain ecosystem-wide shared resources.\n\n### Front-End Dev and Engineering Workstream\n\nAs a continuation of the effort to thoughtfully decentralise the Balancer Ecosystem, we are proposing that the Balancer OpCo also house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO in the medium term. The Balancer OpCo will employ or contract the Front-End Development Team that will service the BalancerDAO. The Balancer OpCo will hold the software subscriptions for the necessary UI and marketing tools, and will host the Balancer.fi website.\n\nThe developers identified to fill these roles are drawn from top talent who have a proven track record performing development for the Balancer Ecosystem via Balancer Labs, and are transitioning over to the more decentralised structure of the DAO. They are passionate about the project and committed to its long-term success. The intention is to recruit additional talent to bolster the team, starting with 5 FTEs and moving to 6 FTEs in Q4 of 2022. There is one part-time contractor included in the headcount below. This is the staffing level determined necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the existing Balancer app, and to continue to expand the scope of the app to support the changes and improvements of the Balancer protocol.\n\nWe note for clarity’s sake that this is the proposal mentioned in the [Funding Proposal for the Balancer Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x05d36e7cb6f2f63ac84eb279ff7bb274eb6375a81429edc77655212c79d6d0ae).\n\n## Leader(s):\n\n### Administrative / Operations\n\nThe Balancer OpCo will operate under the direction of the Balancer Foundation, which will oversee / have responsibility for governance, corporate administration and operations. This includes managing software subscriptions and login credentials for the OpCo team and certain ecosystem-wide platforms and social media accounts.\n\n### Technical Lead for the Front-End Development Workstream\n\nBalancer OpCo's front-end development workstream is led by Gareth Fuller (@garethfuller) and by Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson).\n\nGareth joined Balancer in March of 2021 and quickly rose to lead the front-end team and the launch of Balancer's V2 app. He has over 10 years engineering experience and previously worked at Bitbond as a Senior Full-stack Engineer where he was involved in full-feature development for the P2P Bitcoin lending platform. In 2019 he played an integral engineering role in launching Bitbond's STO (Security Token Offering), one of the first in Europe. Gareth has been professionally involved in the crypto industry since early 2017.\n\nTim joined Balancer in September 2021. He has 15 years of development experience in many different languages, teams and locations. He's been involved in the decentralization space since 2017 initially focused on decentralized social media. Prior to that Tim was a senior developer at Cloud 9 IDE which was acquired by Amazon in 2016. At Amazon he worked on AWS Cloud9 and AWS Robomaker for 4 years before jumping full time into web3.\n\n## How the Front-end team will build the gateway to the Balancer Protocol:\n\nThe front-end team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol, as well as providing UI components and software tools for developers to easily build their own UI’s for Balancer related projects. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\n1. Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\n\n* The front-end team is responsible for the main Balancer website and application. We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to invest, trade, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n* We ensure this UI works across all devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n* We will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit and E2E (End to End) tests.\n* We will continually optimize and improve this front-end so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer gains in the future.\n* Whenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n\n2. Maintain API and caching services to retrieve Balancer information\n\n* The front-end team maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information, as well as providing a SOR interface that services such as CowSwap use to calculate the best trade routes through Balancer pools.\n* This API is hosted on AWS using serverless technology, however it will never be a central point of failure as the front-end can always fall back to using on-chain data. It is also completely open source and deployable via a CDK script so anyone can set up their own API service if they wish.\n\n3. Integrate the front-end with other app stores and services\n\n* As wallets and DeFi app-stores (such as Coinbase wallet, Sia Skynet, or the ethOS phone) become a more common way for users to interact with DeFi applications, we will work with providers to ensure Balancer is available in requested and approved locations.\n\n4. Provide tools that allow anyone to self-host the Balancer front-end\n\n* As Balancer is about maximizing decentralization and permissionless-ness, we seek to avoid the front-end being a centralized point of failure or control. As such we provide docker images and documentation for users to run the front-end locally using their own data providers. We will continually maintain these and make them easier to use over time.\n\n5. Provide documentation, resources and help to allow others to implement their own custom UI's for their project\n\n* Many projects integrate with Balancer smart contracts, such as Aave, Element Fi, CopperLaunch, Aura Finance, Olympus DAO, Gyro Protocol and more. Many more are constantly requesting integrations. We provide them with the UI elements and tools they need to be able to quickly create their own custom UI for their application, accelerating Balancer’s growth in the DeFi space.\n\n## How the Front-end team will measure success\n\nThe overarching goal is a world-class experience for Balancer users, which is seamless and always improving. The key metrics that measure this are:\n\n1. Minimal errors reported to Sentry\n2. 99%+ uptime of core features (pools information, investing, trades)\n3. All new Balancer features that require UI support will be available in the UI within 1 month of launch.\n4. At least one new version of the front-end will be released to production each week.\n\n## Front-end Team’s past achievements\n\nThe front-end team has seasoned web-3 qualifications. They built the Balancer Website and Application and all its current functionality from scratch and made it usable with all networks that Balancer has been deployed to. This included:\n\n* Building the Balancer Website, providing an overview of the service.\n* Building the core balancer app, providing the ability to invest, withdraw, trade tokens and claim rewards.\n* Deploying the balancer app on Arbitrum and Polygon chains.\n* Adding integration with Gnosis for gas-free, mev-resistant trades.\n* Building a pool creation UI so users can quickly and easily create their own custom pools of any tokens they like.\n* Building an API service that Cowswap can use for routing trades through balancer pools, and eventually being a caching service to speed up the front-end.\n* Adding the veBAL voting and staking system and all statistics and information related to that.\n* Supporting new core Balancer pool types as they are launched such as Boosted pools.\n* Adding graphs, APR’s and other information that give users a good indication of earning potential with Balancer.\n* Integrating with many new wallets and services such as Coinbase Wallet and Tally Wallet.\n* Providing a docker image and information for users to run their own front end + API service. Adding one-click deploy to Digital Ocean for this image.\n\n## Front-end Team’s future goals:\n\nWe aim to bring Balancer to as many relevant networks and places as possible, make it easier for developers to take UI components to build their own front-ends, and provide better statistics and analytics for our users.\n\n1. Separate the logic from the UI in the front-end, and move the logic to the Balancer SDK\n\n* We’re turning common queries into simple functions and classes in the SDK. This will allow other projects to more easily integrate with Balancer using these functions. Other projects can implement the logic they need using the SDK, and take visual components they need from the front-end.\n* This will allow the front-end team to iterate faster as we can focus purely on the UI and adding new functionality and speed optimizations while the SDK team handles the underlying logic.\n* The front-end team will also be contributing to the Balancer SDK providing improvements, fixes and new features as they are required for the UI.\n\n2. Improve the overall speed and experience of using the Balancer App\n\n* After much of the logic is moved to the SDK we plan to make the API use that same code to constantly load and cache the latest pool and token information, then provide an easy, fast API the front-end can use to load all the information it needs. This should decrease page loading speeds by more than 80%.\n* For maximum decentralization, the front-end will always have a fallback to using the graph + on-chain data in case this API is ever unavailable.\n* We plan to continually refine and optimize the app over time based on user feedback.\n\n3. Maintain and improve the Balancer app’s reliability and security\n\n* We plan to cover the app’s critical functionality with E2E tests.\n* We will continually add to and improve the app’s unit test coverage.\n* We will keep app dependencies as up to date as is reasonably possible.\n\n4. Make Balancer work seamlessly across all chains it supports\n\n* Currently the front-end is deployed to a separate domain for each network. We plan to consolidate all of this to app.balancer.fi and allow for network switching within this app.\n* Along with this rework we plan to make adding a new chain as easy as adding a new config file, so we can support many different Layer 2's and other chains quickly and easily.\n\n5. Provide better statistics and information to users\n\n* We've started improving Balancer APR's and Graphs to provide more information to our users on past investment performance and how much they can expect to earn. We plan to continually add more features and information to make Balancer a more useful investment dashboard.\n* We’re adding support for pools and tokens that generate yield or rebase in different ways, and ensuring all our statistics around them are correct.\n\n6. Support all the new features Balancer Ecosystem creates\n\n* There are some features in the pipeline such as single asset investing and withdrawing into boosted pools, managed pools etc. We will continually add new UI's to support these features and refine them based on user feedback over time.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n## Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nOne year - July 2022 (Q3 FY22) through June 2023 (Q2 FY23) divided into four quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. As per normal, each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be returned to the Balancer Treasury, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal.\n\nWe’re starting in July to account for the set-up and legal fees around the Balancer OpCo structure and compliance fees. It is envisaged that staff will transfer into the OpCo in Q4 2022.\n\n### Requests for USDC transfers:\n\nQ3 FY22 - USDC 62,219 - actual expenses incurred through the end of July 2022 and forecast for August & September June 2022 - immediate payment requested\n\nQ4 FY22 - USDC 418,691 - for transfer 25 September 2022\n\nQ1 FY23 - USDC 464,068 - for transfer 15 December 2022\n\nQ2 FY23 - USDC 533,217 - for transfer 25 March 2022\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nQ3 FY22 - BAL 116,678.08 - for transfer after the snapshot vote, if successful.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n![|624x335](upload://oMyEzVoRf3ueKQQr1VxWVuCQttX.png)\n\n### People Costs - Engineering\n\nPeople Costs are comprised of remuneration and employment costs for the developers. Remuneration is currently denominated in USD, AUD, GBP, and EUR. Exchange rate fluctuations against the US Dollar will impact the actual results. We have built a 5% buffer on FX rates and plan to hedge against this where practical by converting USD or USDC into reserves in those currencies.\n\nThe Front-end Development team is expected to be onboarded in Q4 with five full-time equivalent engineers, looking to hire one more by the end of Q4 and a possible additional team member in Q2 of 2023.
