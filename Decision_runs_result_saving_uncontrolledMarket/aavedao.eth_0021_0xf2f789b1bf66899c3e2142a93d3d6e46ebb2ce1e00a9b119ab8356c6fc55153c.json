Adding XAUt to Aave v3 would:\n\n1. Diversify the protocol's offerings with a historically stable store of value\n2. Enable users to use gold-backed tokens as collateral or for lending, creating new DeFi use cases\n3. Allow users a hedge against market volatility through exposure to physical gold\n4. Attract traditional finance users who are familiar with gold as an asset class\n\nThe addition of XAUt aligns with Aave's goal of expanding DeFi accessibility while maintaining strong risk management practices through the use of established, well-backed assets.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nTicker: XAUt\n\nContract address: \n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\n### **Disclosure**\n\nACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not afiliated with Tether and has not received compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright**",

Regulatory compliance: USD1 is structured to meet stringent U.S. financial regulations and disclosure standards.\n2. Chainlink Proof of Reserves: USD1 will be the first stablecoin to implement Chainlink’s PoR natively, providing real-time transparency of backing assets.\n3. Chainlink price feed: Live and available for use in Aave integrations.\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers and proposal will be updated accordingly.\n\nUSD1 Overview:\n\n- Ticker: USD1\n- Fiat backed stablecoin\n- Issuer: World Liberty Financial (WLFI)\n- Backing assets: USD cash and short-term U.S treasuries.\n- Audits: PeckShield\n- Price Oracle: Chainlink\n- USD1 Listed on: Binance, ByBit, KuCoin, BitGet, MEXC, HTX.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n1. Deposits enabled for yield generation\n2. Borrowing enabled as a low-volatility asset\n\n### Incentives:\n\nWLFI plans to provide incentives to grow adoption and improve the competitiveness of borrowing rates for USD1 relative to other stablecoin assets on Aave. \n\nSpecific programs will be shared with Aave DAO contributors and the community in ARFC stage.\n\n### Disclosure\n\nThe current proposal has been powered by Skywards. ACI is not afiliated with WLFI and has not received compensation for the creation and edit of this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of TEMP CHECK to gather community & service providers feedback, and escalate to TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n2. Publication of a standard ARFC, if TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed, to continue collecting community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

Benefits of listing: \nslisBNB is the native yield bearing and liquid staking token for BNB, built by Lista DAO. slisBNB appreciates against BNB in line with BNB’s staking APR, allowing users have the freedom to earn additional yields on different DeFi platforms while earning staking rewards passively.\n\nslisBNB is the largest BNB LST in terms of TVL (~$225M) and holders (350,262), listing slisBNB can bring both Aave and Lista communities the opportunities to enjoy the passive yield of supplying slisBNB on Aave as well as the Lista token airdrop. \n\n2. Chain to be deployed: BNB Chain\n3. Proof of Liquidity: Lista DAO is open to provide $2500 weekly incentives, last for 8 weeks to bootstrap the liquidity of slisBNB on Aave. \n4. Useful links: https://lista.org/\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\nThis proposal is powered by core contributor of ListaDAO.\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lista DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n**Next Steps**\n1.If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2.If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3.Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Users contribute ETH and receive tETH, redeemable for their initial ETH plus additional yield. This yield comes from a dynamic strategy that balances staking rewards and interest rate arbitrage on lending protocols. For tETH, this ensures baseline yields equivalent to native ETH staking while capturing additional returns from rate inefficiencies. These assets are composable across DeFi, enabling broader usability.\n\nBy onboarding tETH to Aave V3 Prime Instance, we can:\n\n- **Enhance capital efficiency**: Users can borrow against tETH, unlocking liquidity while continuing to earn restaking rewards.\n- **Increase protocol revenue**: More borrowing activity leads to higher interest income for Aave.\n- **Expand Aave’s influence in restaking finance**: Positioning Aave as a central lending hub for LRTs.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n> Risk Parameters have been updated by Risk Service Providers and ARFC has been updated accordingly. 2025-05-05\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | tETH |\n| Isolation Mode | N/A |\n| Borrowable | No |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 20,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | - |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 0.05% |\n| LT | 0.10% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n| Variable Base | - |\n| Variable Slope1 | - |\n| Variable Slope2 | - |\n| Uoptimal | - |\n| Reserve Factor | - |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | tETH/wstETH |\n\n**E-Mode**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | tETH | wstETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 92.00% | - |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 94.00% | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 2.00% | - |\n\n**tETH/WETH CAPO**\n\n| **maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent** | **ratioReferenceTime** | **MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 12.04% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n## Useful links\n\nhttps://www.treehouse.finance/\n\nhttps://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol/teth/introduction\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is directly powered by ACI (Aave Chan Initiative).

This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow SCR, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Scroll token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nScroll is an Ethereum Layer 2 chain which already has an Aave instance deployment and SCR is the governance token for the Scroll L2. By onboarding SCR to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding SCR’s liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing this token:**\n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their SCR to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow SCR against other collateral allowing them to participate in Scroll governance.\n\n**Market Impact:**\n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding SCR except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding SCR as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new L2 ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:**\n\nScroll.\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:**\n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage. \n\nAs disclosed by Marc Zeller, founder of ACI, the ACI Multisig has received 510K SCR on behalf of Aave DAO. Those funds will be coordinated with Karpatkey and Tokenlogic to define best usage of this airdrop. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-11-25\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Network | Scroll |\n| Isolation Mode | N/A |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 360,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 180,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.0% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Scroll website](https://scroll.io/)\n- [Scroll docs](https://docs.scroll.io/en/home/)\n- [[TEMP CHECK]Onboard SCR to Aave V3 Scroll Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-scr-to-aave-v3-scroll-instance/19568)\n- [[TEMP CHECK Snapshot] Onboard SCR to Aave V3 Scroll Instance](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x900027a0dc30946b463ce8e57a8901b5fc1158546b4d00acae4d2d823d8de732)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
