        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy stataUSDC GSM on Base\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2025-02-05\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying a stataUSDC GHO Stability Module (GSM) on Base supported by a facilitator on Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal recommends deploying a GSM on Base to enhance GHO's price stability during market fluctuations and facilitate new circulating supply issuance.\n\nIntroducing a GSM shortly after launch will help mitigate volatility caused by thin secondary market liquidity while providing users with an alternative way to acquire GHO. Given the various yield opportunities for GHO on Base, limited supply could push GHO above $1.00, as seen during its launch on Arbitrum.\n\nDeploying a stataUSDC GSM would allow users to exchange USDC for GHO, with USDC deposited into Aave Protocol. Each unit of GHO transferred to a user increases the circulating supply, helping to balance market demand.\n\nThe chart below compares USDC deposit rates across Aave v3 instances on Ethereum Core, Arbitrum, and Base. Notably, the USDC deposit APY on Base closely aligns with that of Ethereum Core.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 16.41.37](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ8A4MbFkg.png)\n\nAll GHO issued by the GSM is backed 1:1, ensuring GHO is always over-collateralised.\n\nThe Aave DAO will receive the following revenue streams from the aUSDC GSM:\n\n* Swap Fees;\n* Surplus aToken Yield; and,\n* Any incentives distributed to USDC deposit on Aave v3.\n\nThe aToken yield acts as a proxy for the GHO Borrow Rate. GHO issued by the GSM generates aUSDC yield and GHO Borrowed on Aave v3 generates interest. \n\nThe aUSDC revenue is available every block as it accrues, which is unlike the interest accruing from GHO debt that is only received when a user's loan is repaid.\n\n# Specification\n\n![IMG_6164.PNG|1920x1042](upload://zXNHS4ODhgvChU0vLGVhdcHs4iz.jpeg)\n\nThis instance of the GSM enables users to exchange GHO and USDC at a 1:1 fixed-ratio, with surplus USDC used to mint stataUSDC tokens to earn yield. \n\nThe GSM can mint and burn stataUSDC in exchange for USDC based upon user demand. \n\n![IMG_6150.PNG|1920x1371](upload://7LMwHDLRsayPDz1PS0Qn3W3RLb4.jpeg)\n\nThe ARFC shall incorporate feedback from the community and service providers and detail the final configuration setup before the Snapshot is submitted.\n\n## Ethereum <> Base Facilitator\n\nA facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum specifically to support Base. GHO is considered to have entered circulating supply when users exchange USDC for GHO via the GSM on Base. \n\nThe initial configuration for the Base GhoDirectMinter facilitator as shown below:\n\n| Parameter  |     Value      | \n|    ---     |     :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |   10M Units    | \n\nThis is to be implemented by setting the `newFacilitatorBucketCapacity` to to 10M.\n\nReference: [GhoDirectMinter](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-ghodirectminter/20040)\n\n## CCIP Configuration \n\nWith the launch of GHO on Base now at AIP voting stage, the CCIP Bucket Capacity will be increased by 10M units, matching the GHO supplied to the GSM. \n\n| Paramater | Current | Proposed |\n| --------- | :-----: | :------: |\n| GHO_Bucket_Capacity | 20M | 30M |\n\nThis publication does not include any changes the CCIP Rate Limit Capacity (300,000) and Refill Rate (60/sec).\n\nReference: [GHO Deployment](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=240)\n\n## GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the stataUSDC GSM to be deployed on Base. \n\n| Parameter                | Value  | \n| ------------------------ | :----: | \n| GHO Bucket Cap           | 10.00M |\n| USDC Exposure Cap        | 10.00M |\n| Freeze Lower Bound       | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound       | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee             |  0.00% |\n| Burn GHO Fee             |  0.00% | \n\nWith GHO being minted on Ethereum and being transferred to the GSM, the Mint() function on the Ethereum instance of stataGSM is to be replaced by Transfer() functionality. Pre-minted GHO held by the stataGSM on Base is to be transferred when USDC is received. \n\n## GHO Steward\n\nA new GhoGsmSteward role shall be deployed on Base enabling the GHO Stewards to tailor the GSM configuration to reflect the prevailing market conditions.\n\nReference: [GHO Steward v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-steward-v2-upgrade/19116) \n\n## stataUSDC Revenue\n\nA bot, deployed as part of Dolce Vita will periodically claim the revenue to the DAO's treasury.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the AIP stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Base ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Base to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Base.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Base will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Base network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Base.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Base ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Base ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Base, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Base protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Base ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Base and Optimism ecosystem have provided a large commitment already. The DAO has [previously voted](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x15cbc6b6c5b4ef76a1fb8cf8747460bf327c459fa01b69907fab0119457939a8) for a continued incentives program and matching of the OP Retroactive Grant, that can be used to launch GHO on Base.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Base |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 2,500,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 2,250,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[ARFC: Merit Base incentives and SuperFest matching](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-base-incentives-and-superfest-matching/18450)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Avalanche ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Avalanche to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Avalanche.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Avalanche will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Avalanche network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Avalanche.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Avalanche ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Avalanche ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Avalanche, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Avalanche protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Avalanche ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Avalanche ecosystem has [previously signaled](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci) a large commitment to supporting GHO’s launch on the network.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Avalanche |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 4,500,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Avalanche's Proposal on Temp Check: Rollout Plan for Cross-Chain GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Onboard GHO and Migrate Streams to Lido Instance\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-11-04\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes the following:\n\n* Onboarding GHO to the Lido instance of Aave v3;\n* Providing initial GHO liquidity from the Treasury; and,\n* Migrating Service Providers streams to GHO from Lido instance.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Onboard GHO Lido Instance\n\nWith the circulating supply nearing 180M and nearly 50M in DEX liquidity on Ethereum, this publication proposes adding GHO to the Lido instance of Aave v3.\n\nAdding GHO to the Lido instance of Aave v3 would provide the DAO with several opportunities:\n\n* Mint GHO through a Facilitator and deposit it into the Reserve to generate revenue; \n* Enable Aave DAO to earn yield on existing GHO holdings; and,\n* Establish a GHO reserve that provides an organic deposit yield.\n\nEach of these options offers clear advantages for the Aave DAO and GHO users. GHO is to be onboarded as a borrow-only asset, similar to the current configurations of USDC and USDS.\n\n## Deploy GHO from Treasury\n\nFrom observing the USDC reserve on the Lido instance, it is apparent that GHO would benefit from some initial liquidity. With passive GHO held in the Treasury, this publication proposes depositing available GHO into the new Reserve. With the GHO expected to earn a yield the DAO will benefit from a new revenue source.\n\nA separate proposal will recommend minting and depositing GHO into the new reserve via a new Facilitator on Ethereum to futher help bootstrap the reserve. The addition of sUSDe to the Lido instance is expected to provide strong demand for stablecoin debt.\n\n## Migrate Service Provider Streams\n\nWith the GHO being deployed into Lido, several Aave DAO service provider streams are to be amended to draw GHO from Lido instance. \n\n* Chaos Labs;\n* Aave Labs;\n* LlamaRisk; and,\n* Aave Chan Initiative.\n\nWhen the AIP is submitted, new streams will be created to replace the streams being cancelled. With several streams are soon to expire during December, these streams are not migrated to Lido instance and sufficient GHO will remain in the treasury to facilitate payment to these teams.\n\nWithin this publication, the Aave Grants DAO GHO Allowance is to be cancelled. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below details the parameter configuration of the GHO Reserve on the Lido instance of Aave v3.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled| No |\n|Supply Cap | 20M|\n|Borrow Cap | 2.5M|\n|Debt Ceiling| - |\n|LTV| - |\n|LT| - |\n|Liquidation Bonus| - |\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n|Variable Base| 4.50% |\n|Variable Slope1| 3.00% |\n|Variable Slope2| 50.00% |\n|Uoptimal| 92.00% |\n|Reserve Factor| 10.00% |\n|Flashloanable | Yes |\n|Siloed Borrowing | No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n\nThe below table shows the GHO balance at time of writing for reference only:\n\n| Treasury Asset | Holding      |\n| -------------- | :----------: |\n| GHO            | [7,295,678.65](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) |\n\nNote: The September funding update is to acquire GHO and transfer 5M GHO to Arbitrum to be deployed into the GHO reserve to earn yield.\n\nSufficient GHO shall remain in the Treasury to support streams with a 2024 expiry date, with the balance to be deposited into the Lido instance of Aave v3. This will be confirmed and detailed in the comments just prior to submission of the AIP. \n\nThe following Service Provider streams are to be migrated to using GHO from the Lido instance.\n\n|Service Provider         | StreamID | \n| --------------------    | -------- | \n| Aave Chan Initiative    |  100034  |\n| Aave Labs               |  100039  |\n| Chaos Labs              |  100046  |\n| LlamaRisk               |  100048  |\n\nCancel Aave Grants DAO GHO [Allowance](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-from-aave-grants-winding-down-agd-1-0-and-what-s-next/18707). \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Core & Base - BTC Correlated Asset Update\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2025-02-04\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal focuses curating LBTC for growth across Core and Base instances of Aave v3. Several initiatives are included:\n\n* Onboard LBTC on Base;\n* Create LBTC/cbBTC eMode on Core instance;\n* Create LBTC/fBTC eMode on Core instance;\n* * Create LBTC/tBTC eMode on Core instance;\n* Create LBTC/cbBTC eMode on Base instance; and;\n* Amend cbBTC Borrow Rate.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLombard has demonstrated consistent growth, surpassing $1.8B in TVL, and has established itself as the leading BTC LST in the market. Its initial onboarding, coupled with the first liquid eMode alongside WBTC, quickly reached supply caps, highlighting strong demand for leverage loops between LBTC and BTC wrappers. \n\nOn Aave’s Core instance, cbBTC is the second-largest BTC wrapper. While it experienced strong growth post-listing, the absence of borrowing opportunities has limited its potential. The onboarding of LBTC introduces a new growth avenue for both LBTC, cbBTC, tBTC and fBTC. The new liquid eModes will allow users to loop LBTC exposure while offering attractive deposit rates for cbBTC and fBTC holders, incentivizing them to supply liquidity and fuelling this strategy.\n\nSpecifically to fBTC, a points program will be applied to users who deposit fBTC and also, to different users who borrow fBTC. Leveraging LBTC/fBTC is expected to stimulate demand for fBTC.\n\nTo support this growth strategy, the optimal utilization rate (Uoptimal) for cbBTC and fBTC should be increased from 45% to 80%, aligning them with wBTC. The initial Uoptimal was set when cbBTC had minimal borrowing demand, but the introduction of this liquid eMode is expected to significantly boost cbBTC borrowing activity, warranting this adjustment. For fBTC, not yet listed, the opportunity between Lombard and Ignition developed relatively recently.\n\nAdditionally, Base has emerged as the second-largest platform for cbBTC growth. Onboarding LBTC to Base will replicate this successful dynamic, with LBTC users leveraging existing cbBTC liquidity. For Lombard, Base is already the third-largest ecosystem (after Mainnet and Berachain), with over $117M in TVL, making it an ideal environment to extend this growth strategy.\n\n# Specification\n\nUpdated to include feedback from Risk Service Providers.\n\n## Core Instance\n\n### Amend cbBTC Borrow rate Uoptimal\n\n|Description |Current |Proposed| Change |\n| ---------- | :----: | :----: | :----: |\n| Borrow Rate Uoptimal | 45%  |  80% | +35% |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 60% | -240% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20% | 50% | +30% |\n\n### Amend Proposed fBTC Borrow rate Uoptimal\n\n|Description |Current |Proposed| Change |\n| ---------- | :----: | :----: | :----: |\n| Borrow Rate Uoptimal | 45%  |  80% | +35% |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 60% | -240% |\n\n### Amend Proposed tBTC Borrow rate Uoptimal\n\n|Description |Current |Proposed| Change |\n| ---------- | :----: | :----: | :----: |\n| Borrow Rate Uoptimal | 45%  |  80% | +35% |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 60% | -240% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20% | 50% | +30% |\n\n### Liquid E-modes\n\n| Parameters | Value | Value \n| --- | :---:| :---:| \n|Asset   | LBTC | wBTC |\n|Collateral| Yes | No | \n|Borrowable| No  | Yes | \n|Max LTV| 84% | - | \n|Liquidation Threshold |86%| - | \n|Liquidation Bonus |3.00%| - | \n\n| Parameters | Value | Value | \n| --- | :---:| :---:| \n|Asset   | LBTC | cbBTC |\n|Collateral| Yes | No | \n|Borrowable| No  | Yes | \n|Max LTV| 84% | - | \n|Liquidation Threshold |86%| - | \n|Liquidation Bonus |3.00%| - | \n\n| Parameters | Value | Value | \n| --- | :---:| :---:| \n|Asset   | LBTC | tBTC |\n|Collateral| Yes | No |\n|Borrowable| No  | Yes |\n|Max LTV| 84% | - | \n|Liquidation Threshold |86%| - |\n|Liquidation Bonus |3.00%| - | \n\n| Parameters | Value | Value | \n| --- | :---:| :---:| \n|Asset   | LBTC | fBTC |\n|Collateral| Yes | No |\n|Borrowable| No  | Yes |\n|Max LTV| 84% | - | \n|Liquidation Threshold |86%| - |\n|Liquidation Bonus |3.00%| - | \n\n*Note: This ARFC assumes fBTC has already been listed on Aave by the time the Snapshot vote has finished.
