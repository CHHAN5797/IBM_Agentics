        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] TokenLogic Proposal \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-08-25\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication present the Aave Community the opportunity to onboard TokenLogic as a service provider. TokenLogic shall focus on Aave DAO finances and support GHO adoption.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nMembers of the TokenLogic team have been contributing to Aave Protocol since mid 2020. More recently, the team has been expanding in preparation to better support our three focus areas:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* Safety Module modelling\n* GHO Adoption\n\nTokenLogic is a developer focused team with a proven track recorded dating back to March 2023 when the delegation platform was annouced. During this time we have delivered the following:\n\n* 5 AIPs, 6 payloads, several GHO related BIPs\n* [GHO liquidity pools analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n* Coordinated [7.7%](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071) veBAL support for GHO's launch\n* Stoodup an analytics platform \n* Launch of [GHO Analytics frontend](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n\nThe team is growing and we onboarded an accounting team to start developing a Aave Financial Reporting (genesis to date) frontend, launch date mid/late Q4 2023.\n\n# Current & Future Areas of Focus\n\n The below provides a high level overview of our **key focus** areas:\n\n* **Treasury Management**\n    * Improving the risk adjusted return of DAO's assets\n        * Aave v2 to v3 migrations\n        * Swap long tail assets to ETH / stable coins\n    * Improving capital efficiency\n        * Convert wMATIC to MaticX & stMATIC\n    * Managing strategic assets\n        * Upgrades to Strategic Asset Manager v1 functionality as required\n    * Modelling asset purchase / bribe\n        * Participate in Quest/Bribe v acquiring asset\n    * Engage, collaborate and support community lead initiatives\n        * Example: How best to optimise CRV holding\n    * Oversee Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) deployment\n        * If DAO elects to provide POL, ensure Boost is directed to holding to optimise returns and maintain the strategy through claiming and swapping/locking rewards.\n    * Design and create a contract for managing DAO's POL\n        * Perform swaps, claim incentives, transfer assets etc...\n    * Claim Aave Protocol revenue fees at the end of each month\n        * This bot is currently operated by Llama\n\n* **GHO Liquidity / Incentives Management**\n    * Create Liquidity Management Committee / Budget\n        * Provide modelling to support Committee decision making\n    * Liquidity Incentive Optimisation Analysis (Strategic Assets)\n        * Target pool sizes & APRs \n    * Explore synergies with Safety Module diversification\n        * Potential to include GHO liquidity pools\n        * We will lead this effort after Llama's contract finishes\n* **Financial Reporting**\n    * Runway forecast\n        * Specifically tracking asset balance and drawdown rates to show when other assets require being swapped to fund the DAO\n    * Budget and resource allocation\n        * Work with ACI and others to develop a DAO budget\n    * Transparent accurate, third party reviewed, accessible financial statments\n        * Launch a financial statment frontend mid/late Q4 2023\n        * Cover Ethereum, Polygon (PoS), Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche initially and expand over time.\n        * Quarterly financial publications \n    * Revenue per Reserve v time charts\n        * Daily or Hourly data showing revenue being generated per Reserve on each Aave v2 and v3 iteration\n        * Users will be able to select an asset and see total revenue noiminated in the underlying or select an instance of Aave and a specific asset.\n        * Data will be displayed graphically with some ability to interact with the charts\n* **Supporting GHO Adoption**\n    * Collaborate with other teams to support GHO adoption\n        * Promote utility and velocity\n    * Continual development of GHO Analytics frontend\n    * Promote adoption through DeFi integrations\n        * Examples include working with teams to build real yield strategies, structured products and list GHO as collateral\n* **Safety Module Improvements**\n    * Model the SM performance during shortfall events\n        * Create a frontend that show historical performance for swapping certain amounts of each asset instantly (not dutch auction) via an aggregator\n    * Model / forecast emission budget\n        * AAVE emissions are finite, GHO is better\n        * Capital efficiency could be improved through adoption of quests and/or acquiring assets that control the emission schedule of another protocol\n    * Advocate for diversification and reducing the reward budget\n        * Introduction of stable coins, ETH and other assets to reduce reliance on AAVE during shortfall events\n    * Collaborate with others to refine to enhance the SM's effectiveness at providing a backstop for Aave Protocol\n        * BGD to implement on-chain upgrades\n        * Model liquidity pool assets to be added to SM\n        * Work with ACI, BGD, Llama and others to determine a target coverage, implementation of proposals and refine the asset blend\n\nEach of the areas detailed above is interwoven and has a material affect on the DAO's financial status. TokenLogic is committed to working with other DAO contributors collaboratively and constructively to better the Aave Protocol. \n\nTo support the initiatives aboves, we have created an analytics platform. The GHO dashboard is our first analytics initiative. Beyond GHO, we plan on using the analytics platform to provide the DAO with near live revenue data stream for each asset reserve on supported networks. We seek to always incorporate community feedback and build out any requests from the community.\n\nOur team is very well connected across defi and we intend to support Aave and GHO where ever we can. To this end, we are already working with several teams looking to integrate GHO and have been working with @0xbilll at AGD with targeted spending initiatives.\n\nTo ensure continuation of active work scopes, TokenLogic will continue to manage the migration of users on Polygon v2 to v3. This includes either fortnightly or monthly parameter adjustments. We encourage another service provider to pick up the Avalanche v2 migration. However, if required, we are happy to support provided it doesn't impact our key focus ares which we will be measure against.\n\n# Prior Work\n\nThis section, we will focus on what TokenLogic has delivered to Aave DAO:\n\n* [TokenLogic Delegate Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n* Asset Listings\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX to Aave V3 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-to-aave-v3-ethereum/13051)\n    * [[AIP] Add FRAX Ethereum Aave v3](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/260/)\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX Arbitrum Aave v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-arbitrum-aave-v3/13222)\n    * [[AIP] Add ARB to Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/273/)\n* GHO Liquidity\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] GHO Liquidity Pools](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655)\n    * [[ARFC] GHO Liquidity Pools: Primary Pools Initial Strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n    * Coordinated veBAL and vlAURA support for the launch of GHO\n* GHO Analytics Dashboard\n    * https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/\n* GHO Yield Strategy\n    * Supported **Sommelier** with development of real yield strategies that manage GHO liquidity across several DEXs.

With several developers, strategists and accountants apart the team, we are mostly manned up and ready to take on a more involved service provider scope. \n\n# Budget\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of 350,000 USD for an initial 6 month period to support our initiatives.\n\nThis budget will contribute to covering operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure plus the resources required to deliver our work.\n\nThe payment terms are as shown below:\n\nUpfront Transfer: ~~210,000~~ 0 GHO\nStream: ~~140,000~~ 350,000 GHO\n\nThis is a ~~60/40~~ 0/100 split of upfront/streamed.\n\nAddress: `eth:0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nSimilar to ACI, TokenLogic is to be included in the [Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gas-rebate-for-recognized-delegates/13290) program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts and deployment costs.\n\nTokenLogic commits to not receiving any funds from other entities for creating proposals and publishing AIPs on Aave Protocol.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nThe below provides an overview of how the DAO can assess TokenLogic's performance:\n\n* Migrate Aave DAO funds from v2 to v3\n* Create Liquidity Committee with funding\n* Optimise GHO liquidity incentives \n* Strategic Assets are being actively used\n* Runway funding sustained (>6 months of the correct assets)\n* Convert Treasury assets to LSTs\n* Launch financial statement frontend\n* Continual flow of new GHO Dashboard features\n\nAs DAOs are dynamic, when more urgent priorities emerge TokenLogic will support and proactively work with other service providers to act in Aave's best interest. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf the [TEMP CHECK] is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal [ARFC] submission to governance.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining transparency throughout the process and providing regular updates the community on our progress.\n\nWe thank everyone for considering our proposal and appreciate your support. We look forward to working together and driving success to the Aave Protocol.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "title": "[ARFC] Aave Treasury Proposal for RWA Allocation",
        "author": "0x62a43123FE71f9764f26554b3F5017627996816a",
        "body": "**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA\n\n**Author:** @Khan \n\n**Date:** Sep 12, 2023\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal brings on Centrifuge as a service provider to the Aave DAO to setup a legal structure to support RWA investments, develop RWA specific management and governance processes, and allocate $1M of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings to a liquid US T-Bill fund on Centrifuge, as a proof of concept investment.\n\nThis is a first step towards a long term effort for Aave to develop and launch an RWA Facilitator that will back GHO with Real World Assets. With this proposal Aave can earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in the RWA industry.\n\nThe proposal minimizes upfront cost and completely recoups the initial investment within 6-12mo and starts earning yield for Aave within the first 3mo. It locks up no long term capital and leaves the DAO in full control over the treasury allocation.\n\nThe main results of this proposal:\n1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave protocol to invest in RWAs.\n1. Through Prime, the Aave Treasury will allocate $1M of USDC to the Anemoy LTF, a short-duration US treasury bill pool on Centrifuge.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, ignoring the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets for various reasons.\n\nToday, with roughly 17% of the treasury in stablecoins (~13m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of recurring revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment. These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.\n\nBeyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime is purpose-built for DeFi native organizations, offering the critical services and infrastructure necessary to onboard a diverse portfolio of RWA through a single interface.\n\nCentrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams.\n\n### **Specification**\n\n#### **Setting up the Aave DAO Legal Conduit**\nThis proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure for the benefit of the Aave DAO that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave token holder vote.\n\nThe process for establishing the legal framework is as follows: The Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Aave DAOs interests. The legal structure itself will be established per the previously discussed legal framework developed by Centrifuge. The defining documents and legal agreement team will be created to incorporate specific processes around the DAOs interaction with the foundation company. The results of this work will be presented to the Aave DAO, an analysis from the external counsel will be provided, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, likely via Snapshot or other requisite process as requested by the community.\n\nThe legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance through a process defined in the legal documents, is capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO full legal recourse to their investments. The legal counsel, while required under local Cayman law, is retained for the purposes of having an independent legal party to protect Aave’s interest.\n\nThe structure defines the actions the foundation can take, such as initiating investments or redemptions. Any action can be made only with approval from the DAO and providing a DAO approved “resolution” to the Foundation entity described above instructing the Foundation to act in accordance with the resolution. The specific details of this process will be developed alongside the Aave community.\n\nThis framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures 1. There, the same structure is used to support a >$1.2B debt ceiling, with >600m+ actively deployed.\n\nMore information on the fund, the legal framework, and the processes described here can be found in the [on going FAQ discussion here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n\n#### **Initial pilot investment in Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund**\n\nOnce the legal structure has been defined and implemented, a specific DAO resolution will be presented to the DAO that instructs the Foundation to perform a 1M investment into the Anemoy LTF and transfers 1M USDC from the DAOs treasury into the Anemoy pool onchain.\nCentrifuge will work with Aave to do an initial test investment and then a partial redemption to test out the complete rails.\n\n#### **Scaling beyond the first transaction**\n\nIt is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. This proposal creates an initial deployment into the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund of $1M (pending DAO approval at the time investment). It is up to the community to initiate further investments, but we recommend keeping RWA allocations at a fixed cap of the overall Aave balance sheet until the community is more comfortable.\n\nFrom there on, further investment and redemption actions are in full control of the Aave DAO. The process can easily be integrated to support portfolio and allocation decisions made through a more formal treasury management process, either manually or programmatically. Centrifuge is committed to supporting these efforts for the duration of this proposal’s stream.\n\nOutside of US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes in the future:\n\n| Bucket| Description | Target Return | Liquidity\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Liquid | Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds| 5-6% | Daily\n| Preservation | Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc. | 6-8% | 3-6 months\n| Acceleration | Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets | 8-20% | 3-24mo |\n\n#### **Summary Process**\nIn summary, the following process will be executed through this proposal:\n1. Acquire Caymans Legal Counsel\n1. Conduct initial legal research and analysis alongside counsel, share to forum\n1.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module Upgrade Part IV - Incentives Management Upgrade\nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @dydymoon & @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-04-13\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication focuses on how incentives are distributed to reduce the overall AAVE spend and enhance the profitability of the Aave DAO.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe current SM incentives budget is 1100 AAVE/day. These rewards allow Aave to attract deposits, where up to 30% can be used to insure the protocol in case of shortfall event. At the moment, 100% of these incentives are spent in liquidity mining from the Ecosystem Reserve, which represents $89.3K daily or $32.6M yearly expense for the DAO.\n\nThis publication presents the community with an opportunity to reshape how AAVE incentives are distributed to significantly improve Aave’s economics and enhance the capital efficiency of the SM.\n\n* Increased Backstop Value\n* Decreased AAVE Spend\n* Increased Yield for depositors\n* Improved Profitability and Financial Sustainability\n\nThis publication focuses on how incentives are distributed to reduce the overall AAVE spend without exceeding the current AAVE budget & shares the estimated results from the strategy.\n\n# Rationale\n\nA quick recap of proposed from the current design so far:\n\n* Part I - SstkABPT update proposal (Part I)\n  * Support of the migration to a new BPT B-80-AAVE-20wstETH\n\n* Part II - Categories implementation (Part II)\n  * Single assets, volatile BPTs and stable BPTs.\n\n* Part II- Slashing update (Part II)\n  * Each category will have a different max slashing parameter\n\n* Part III -BPT positions staked on the SM - smBPTs (Part III)\n  * Create gauges for smBPTon staked assets and enable users to receive to avoid incentives dilution, Introduce smBPT wrapper, and explain Aura Finance strategy to receive BAL & AURA rewards.\n\nThis publication presents a revised outlook on how the majority of the current AAVE budget could be distributed as vote incentives for smBPT gauges. Additionally, the DAO could decide to optimize its strategic voting power to reduce the SM costs.\n\nDo note the APR generated from depositing into the SM has dependencies such as the BAL, AURA and AAVE token prices. If this proposal is approved, several solutions can be explored to reduce this risk. If it becomes unprofitable over time because of BAL or AURA prices, a fallback option can be added to switch back to the current LM design if needed until finding a better optimization.\n\nThe design is flexible enough to accommodate various market conditions and for Aave to pivot from AAVE to GHO rewards over time. This represents a shift on the base incentives from Aave governance token distribution to yield derived from cash flow sustained by the business.This will allow to improve the fallback option to always optimize the best yield between direct profit sharing distributed or used to leverage more yield through votes incentives.\n\n## veBAL Voting Power\n\nLlama recently published a proposal to deploy the BAL holdings. This proposal will help provide a better understanding of why Llama recommended the community to vote for acquiring veBAL.\n\nOverview of the veBAL position if locked today:\n\n![|566x186](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2xlP4WbgttqDygSf06fk1AyRlqdq8JgW_xVGyPyZnkcNpN9EEGFfY_H_VMcVozZY9mrdzrQrp37PxbXQkSUxTjHYvsavlxyvvFFGqoHp80eLqjc7owdYdFugJ40Tp7xs2nbYZoKnNRk7dWkO9wzx5CA)\n\nETH needed and the LP tokens amount received are verified with https://balancer.tools/veBAL.\n\n![|414x79](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LECeCOxUTEB4UlvHAyEaCa3FEImGhUYGdDxKUCULK_eqW7dU9V4MaEF70AH6pJFHOMSjM-KaCjcJ-T_l8qG_sSu-L611Ctjk6JejFn6pDxWe1r13IIa9dsVQ2mYsgykdgYqIyFO2LqE73491CcNtjE0)\n\nThe table above shows how much weekly BAL emission is controlled, assuming the DAO uses only its owned veBAL voting power (i.e. without creating vote incentives).These calculations are based on the BAL emission in April 2023: 121,930 BAL/week instead of 145,000 until March 2023.\n\nAave DAO voting power is a good start and can be utilized to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Boost the Staked aTokens gauges\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimize the yield on treasury strategies\n\nHowever, due to the limited veBAL holding size relative to Aave’s aspirations, the community will need to choose between the choices above. Several other possibilities to increase the strategic voting power accumulation in addition to the reserve factors earnings are presented below:\n\n* [Deploy treasury strategies to farm BAL/AURA with stables & ETH](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-ethereum-collector-contract/12205)\n\n* [Acquire more BAL/start acquire AURA with the treasury to lock it ](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813)\n* Potential Grants from Aura & Balancer\n\n## Safety Module Cover Overview\n\nAssuming that 100% of the Aave TVL was covered by the SM, the DAO would pay 30,02% on its insurance.\n\n![|602x59](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_4IccaU07Rbv86PhERhDx1iYKoJDNE01HRG31zy3tSaqw0OAn_RY8AufyPgdDFLddVifzmD4xQmow_tzDYmH7yzg7gTbRUEu94dP_AgnVEl5sbwx5GviMWSSMue0ulB1eFAn5HTE0QgBNF4rBqGWgSI)\n\n(1.43% of the TVL is currently covered and the DAO which pays 30,02% APR on these funds). The new strategy aims to increase the Safety Module coverage above 2.00% while also reducing insurance costs by at least 30%.\n\n## Incentives Distribution Upgrade\n\nNote that all TVLs below have been added to estimate the max capacity of the SM with the current budget by maintaining the APR in range.\n\n### Single Assets\n\nThis publication features continuing the rewards with 25% of the current budget for single assets. At a later date, the community can explore progressively replacing AAVE with GHO rewards.\n\n* AAVE: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n60% of the current stkAAVE TVL\n\nWe estimate a reduction of the TVL due to the APR lowered by the budget reallocation\n\n(200 AAVE/day until GHO is live vs 550 AAVE/day at the moment.) .\n\n* ETH / stETH: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n75k ETH / stETH\n\n(Llama proposes to allocate a budget of 75 AAVE/day to reward ETH and/or stETH deposits until GHO is live)\n\nThis means reducing the liquidity mining by focusing it on single assets only, since it’s not possible to add gauges for it. The remaining AAVE currently being spent in LM to incentivize both veBAL & vlAURA voters on Warden Quest, which allows to redirect rewards on smBPTs gauges, in a better proportion than LM.\n\n## What is Warden Quest?\n\nWarden Quest by Paladin, offers a new approach to Gauge Weight vote acquisition for Curve & Balancer. Instead of offering an arbitrary amount of rewards to influence voters, Quest allows players to set parameters & rewards for each weekly vote period.\n\nAfter the rewards distribution to voters, if the total budget wasn't spent (i.e.,if the objective wasn't reached), Quest creators can redeem the unspent budget minus the fees.\n\nAdditionally, Quest now offers the possibility for vlAURA holders to claim rewards from veBAL quests, allowing Aave DAO to create vote incentives for both at once.\n\nFinally, with the estimated budget of this post, Quest fees would be at 2,8% instead of 4%.\n\nNote: This proposal doesn’t plan to create vote incentives on the StakedATokens gauges, but the DAO could vote to do it later. In such a case, the Quest weekly volume would lead to the lowest fee possible: 2%. More information on Warden Quest can be found [here](https://doc.paladin.vote/warden-quest/introduction).\n\n## Volatile & Stable BPTs\n\nThe SM Upgrade strategy aims to maintain the volatile BPTs APR in the 8 to 12% range, and the stable BPTs APR in the 18 to 22% range. The BAL & AURA rewards could be distributed weekly to SM depositors.\n\n* B-80AAVE-20wstETH: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n* B-80GHO-20wETH: Max TVL estimation used: $50M$\n\n* B-GHO-3Pool: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n![|602x132](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SpKMcUQtiB4wEV4_28TEmzln1kV-XvgxaMWl8b7Gskws4NyE3R4_s4sGxGCBSzI8EDv254g8Jep_kTdi74E4OEEzYijcNq56-6Kxp-0KGO2_NrquOGi0ll3R-RtSEB9XO2oAqzoR9sFhHQWkGr6Gpfw)\n\nThese estimations demonstrate the possibility of reaching the APR targets outlined above.\n\nThe vlAURA votes amount needed is defined by a target in veBAL votes, which is why the total exceeds 100% of the vlAURA supply.The veBAL votes target can be reached by creating vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, veTETU and sdBAL, all supported on Quest.\n\nNote: veTETU vote incentives would require more management as veTETU on Polygon, so we’ve excluded it from this proposal for now. sdBAL vote incentives are also excluded because of the small veBAL holdings.\n\n![|602x152](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/64YqdC6KmmZAUULAUOg71tPIv1c0B1bLlomXQ6jJVgcwf18mWUMAcZhdcBvdLhi7NjPLJYoTftfl2YPxsZ179v8u_ogbq0Es3U61gptCID7YD1QnxsNL61f3bfMhaRz4N1669rUJTy9jGyy4SyjN4R0)\n\n(Yellow cells are manually added & Orange cells are max estimated TVL. The remaining data are calculated or imported from Etherscan and CoinGecko data in real time, so numbers are changing very often depending on all the variables).\n\n## smBPTs Quests Results Overview\n\n![|602x83](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xmMXkpyZUu4J7HJC9r_b0lZyKGiWp-_LXkst-HVh9QRFTuHuMXCiWC0aNI_aOdckGrvTfu1Zt6Q9uLKFDRfqaFT9vZUOLIbsDe04lrjVEppw9sb8li1bbpVKsTkZZc3ACHIhUQkcQzx_6z1mEokw7bM)\n\nThe cost per vlAURA/round is from [Llama Airforce](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/rounds/hh/aura-bal/8).\n\nThe vlAURA votes are priced 2% above the last round's prices, as this market does fluctuate a lot (1 round = 2 weeks). Aave would need to control ~30,08% of the veBAL voting supply on the SM gauges to reach the target APRs shown above.\n\nThe table above demonstrates that Aura is way more interesting than Balancer without max boost. Creating the same vote incentives but farming on Balancer would not be profitable.\n\nIn this strategy, the SM depositors would earn $194,000/round ($97,000/week) in extra BAL & AURA rewards directed with votes incentives compared to AAVE tokens liquidity mining distribution.\n\nWhile the TVL max estimations are high in this proposal, this helped define the max capacity of this strategy with the current budget, evaluate the yield possibilities, and learnt the communities sentiment. However, the goal is to progressively increase the TVL target & associated votes incentives budget.\n\nThe requested amount of votes and rewards requires an active management to optimize the Quests, which is why this publication leans away from using Snapshot to determine Aave’s veBAL gauges votes and instead recommends considering different options to optimize the votes, which will be presented in the voting framework proposed in the coming days.\n\nIf the Quests are not filled, the unspent rewards can be redeemed by the DAO (minus the fees) and used for the next round. In this case, a fallback budget should be planned to temporarly compensate part of the yield in liquidity mining initially, then in GHO over time. .\n\nTo avoid this to happen, the strategy considers paying slightly more per vote than the market based on previous round price, to align the economic interest of the protocol and the voters to make sure the votes target are reached. OTC deals could also be discussed with important voters in this ecosystem.\n\n![|706x118](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zTMjQiAa0TUwZ5MiVQPW9OROSRkoRj1XhD6LuEFdL0hK_TGp713OdJOv1R7a9SZuuWJP3Dm9wlXoPSf878NSzbr9Q9E74Yd3iwpRfNwwNc-uQjPLTwlVTK85No_OmJ3wdVjiROx1ocIh1pCauoAGGE4)\n\nThe AAVE amount spent in vote incentives in the table below is changing very often as defined by several parameters, such as the amount of votes required, the price for veBAL & vlAURA votes, the AAVE token price, the TVL in the smBPT gauges, and later on, governance updates on the SM design proposed if the budget is changed.\n\nWith the above estimations, there is a reduction of the daily LM budget, which can be accumulated as a fallback budget to avoid the unfavorable situation explained above.\n\n![|368x81](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7RQIzjSHyb9w7XIsffWS78g0smGilUe8Dco3vuymbmWPRBTak9Darub-3m7FLuDTULG17gYabPNiAoq3DDScnWkttSAJJzx7-s28LQBjBEtlSJYRWpqm0kIwyLBtwF5BUsmmfoqQuwcyTEt4PuMpH-I)\n\nAs expected, the cover cost (insurance APR) is also reduced by half, which validates the last goal of this proposal.\n\n![|515x271](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tR9EqP3W5s0SMSNuM5QnBfwq_dSnrZm3OAlylx5AAG7ExYpDgSNDLizhWMpukSfKhEEWtUw9yBxr-_xHvcBSeFkPpaLKDoFgl_7LYBO0t2Wh7TpMxxxzbN8rRhAPPE7ec-Vzh5HalS1-xsdsEZ3Lkag)\n\nThe last table in Part IV and the 2 above demonstrate that with current market metrics & estimated TVL, the APRs reached on Aura are in the range expected, as well as the average insurance cost reduction from 30,02% to 17,23% and the cover increase from $119M to $175M.\n\nAlso, considering that this strategy will help with both growing the SM (TVL & Cover) and improving the liquidity for Aave tokens, other incentive budgets for GHO liquidity or liquidity mining on StakedATokens could be used for the same strategy.\n\nActions related to the strategic voting power and votes incentives management will be defined by the framework proposal defined in part V, such as:\n\n* Lock veToken assets into Balancer and Aura to generate increased rewards.\n* Create votes incentives on Quest\n* Update the boost power, delegate or sell it on Warden if unused.\n* Vote on gauges & proposals decisions\n* Claim protocol fees\n\n# Technical Implementations:\n\n* Enable weekly distribution for Stable & Volatile BPT rewards\n* Whitelist the AAVE token on Quest as reward (No extra proposal needed)\n* Define the Aave voting framework (Part V)\n\n# Voting options:\n\nYAE - Update the incentives management strategy\nNAE - Continue classic liquidity mining\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.

        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is a delegate platform dedicated to actively participating in Aave governance and contributing to the protocol's success. As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward.\n\nTo continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact.\n\n## **ACI's current & future areas of focus**\n\n1. **Governance and AIP Development**\n    - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes\n    - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs\n    - Engaging with the community on forum discussions\n    - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders\n2. **Treasury Efficiency and Management**\n    - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management.\n    - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors.\n    - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation.\n    - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users.\n3. **Protocol and Ecosystem Development**\n    - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs\n    - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis)\n    - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral\n    - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for “Real Yield” revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO\n    - Support the expansion of Aave markets in “new Frontiers” networks\n4. **Research and Analysis**\n    - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments\n    - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community\n    - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions\n    - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n5. **Team Expansion and Operations**\n    - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better\n    - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure\n    - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement\n    - Start a “Meta-Governance” focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered “Aave-Maximalist,” there’s a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other “professional” delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem.\n6. **Independence & Transparency**\n    - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power.\n   - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol.\n   - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely.\n   - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO.\n\n## **Previous Work**\n\nHere are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative:\n\n- **Governance Coordination**: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly **ZERO** AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022.\n- **AIPs**: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave.\n    \n- **Governance improvement**: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible.\n- **Delegators & contributor coordination:** The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous “co-authorship” synergies with other DAO actors.\n\n## **Requested Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us:\n\n- Sustainably continue our current work\n- Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work\n- Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the “One-Man Army” meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation\n- Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem\n\nBy securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposal's specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal.\nWe commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal. We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to drive the success of the Aave protocol.",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes to renew our engagement with the Aave DAO, providing our full suite of risk management products and services, covering all of Aave, including V2, V3, and GHO, across all current and future deployments.\n\nOur current annual engagement is set to end on November 7th, 2023.\n\n# Background\n\nIn November 2022, Chaos formally joined the Aave DAO as a service provider specializing in risk management and parameter optimization. This partnership began with our original [engagement to cover V3 markets](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025), followed by an [extension to cover V2 markets formally](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/), with an additional [engagement amendment](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-scope-and-compensation-amendment/14407) approved by the community in August 2023 to adjust the scope and compensation for the remainder of the original term. \n\nDuring this time, we have consistently demonstrated our unwavering dedication to the DAO, covering all aspects of the protocol across all deployments and providing the community with proactive risk parameter recommendations alongside reactive analyses and risk-mitigating strategies in light of significant market events. Chaos has initiated over 60 ARFCs and supported nearly 100 additional proposals and community discussions, including parameter optimization, onboarding of new assets and new deployments, deprecation of V2 and migration to V3, GHO launch, and community support during major market events.\n\nDuring our engagement, the protocol incurred minimal bad debt while facing major market events, namely the USDC depeg in early March 2023. \n\n💡 A full overview of Chaos Labs’ activities through the past year can be found in our monthly community updates [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-monthly-community-update/11174/6).\n\n## Highlighted previous work and resources\n\n### Products:\n\n- [Aave Risk Monitoring and Alerting Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/overview)\n- [Chaos Labs Asset Protection Tool](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-asset-protection-tool)\n- [Parameter Recommendations Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations)\n- [GHO Risk Monitoring Dashboard](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/GHO)\n\n### Methodologies:\n\n- [Chaos Labs’ Research](https://chaoslabs.xyz/research)\n- [Chaos Labs -

Our methodologies are rooted in an integrative approach, offering protocol robustness and protecting funds from market risks through dynamic risk parameter recommendations. We provide a holistic approach encompassing software and services to mitigate risks in volatile markets, countering economic attacks on the protocol and ensuring the secure preservation of user funds.\n\n## Scope\n\n### **Risk Parameter Optimization**\n\nDeploying our custom agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors. Chaos Labs will thoroughly analyze the ecosystem and build custom agent-based simulations. These simulations leverage protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. Thorough system analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven optimization and risk management recommendations. \n\nCoverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.\n\n**Parameter Recommendation Platform**\n\nThe Chaos Labs Parameter Recommendation Portal is designed to provide the Aave community with a comprehensive understanding of the simulation outputs and underlying data to optimize risk parameter settings. By providing a clear and intuitive interface that highlights the impact of different parameter settings on risk and return, we can foster a more informed and engaged community, facilitating ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing. \n\nIn addition to presenting the data outputs from the Chaos Simulation Engine, the Parameter Recommendation Portal offers users unparalleled access to the underlying simulation mechanics and implications, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the simulations and their results.\n\n### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWe offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health. \n\nAs part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.\n\n### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3\n\nChaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the 'Background' section. \n\nAs we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2. \n\nGiven the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.\n\n### **Protocol Growth**\n\nChaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n\nAs we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol's expansion and sustainability.\n\n### GHO\n\nFollowing the initial launch of GHO, Chaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:\n\n- **Parameter Optimization** - we will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.\n- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.\n- **Facilitator's Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - we will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.\n- **And more**\n\n### Chaos Team Support\n\nAs part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.\n\nOur team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response. In the event of any incidents or issues, our team will be on hand to provide timely and effective incident response, minimizing the potential impact on the protocol and its users.\n\n**Ongoing and Proactive Risk Management**\n\nThis includes detailed analyses of new asset onboarding, assessing the potential risks and benefits of launching in new markets and providing a thorough understanding of parameter recommendations, including qualitative data and position analysis. \n\n**Incident Response**\n\n This includes supporting various events, including liquidity changes, asset depegs, price volatilities, etc. Our team provides ongoing support in these events, including market monitoring and alerting, ad-hoc risk analysis, and recommendations on risk-mitigating actions.\n\nOur team of experts brings a wealth of experience in risk management and data analysis, enabling us to provide the insights and recommendations necessary to navigate even the most challenging market conditions. By working closely with the community, we can provide the support and guidance necessary to promote Aave’s long-term success and sustainability.\n\n## Communications:\n\n- Our team will share our recommendations and analyses through dedicated governance forum discussions, maintaining transparency and facilitating effective communication with the community.\n- We commit to providing a monthly update post, highlighting completed work and outlining our future areas of focus.\n- We are consistently available for community calls and regularly schedule check-up calls with Aave delegates. These calls primarily focus on addressing risk-related inquiries, offering insights into existing proposals, and gathering general feedback.\n\n## Terms\n\n- 12-month engagement, November 13th 2023-November 13th, 2024\n- $1.6M, streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n    - Given community preference, we suggest the full amount to be paid in GHO but are open to any composition of stables/AAVE tokens.\n\n## Specification:\n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (`0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0`) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 1,600,000 aUSDC or GHO for a 12-month duration.\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and Tashi. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, we are targeting a Snapshot vote on November 1st, 2023.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) on November 8th, 2023.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
