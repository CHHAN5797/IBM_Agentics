Users would be unable to mint GHO and arbitrage the price back to $1 (mint 1 GHO and swap >$1).\n    \nWith many liquidity pools to be created and rewards distributed across, it is important the DAO can swiftly increase the GHO Borrow Cap to mitigate GHO trading above $1. The GHO Stewards will be able to increase the GHO Borrow Cap swiftly to mitigate GHO trading above peg. The GHO Stewards can increase the GHO Borrow Cap up to a threshold of 50M units. \n\n## Borrow Rate\n\nThe GHO Stewards will replace ACI's ability granted via [AIP-381](ipns://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/381/) and will implement the Borrow Cap adjustment via an admin role without needing to push an AIP to vote.\n\nThe Borrow Rate is to be adjusted gradually to enable the ecosystem to expand in a safe way. The criteria is outline below:\n\nIf the trailing 30 day average price of GHO stays outside a $0.995<GHO>$1.005 price range, the GHO Stewards are able adjust the Borrow Rate no more than 100bps per 7 day period, up to a maximum 9.5% APR.\n\n## GSM Parameters\n\nDetails on each of the GSM features can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-stability-module/13927) on the governance forum and [here](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/pull/361/files#diff-01739da53781eee5a30dd9a60e87949d0f6d516480f17534f1a8d575fc87e719) on Github. In short, the GHO Steward can customise the GSM parameters to suit prevailing market conditions.  \n\n# Specification\n\nGHO Stewards will consist of the following Service Providers:\n                                    \n* @karpatkey_TokenLogic - @Sisyphos and @MatthewGraham\n* @ACI - @MarcZeller\n* @ChaosLabs - @OriN\n* @Gauntlet - @Pauljlei\n\nThe GHO Stewards will determine if and how much to adjust the following:\n\n1) GHO Borrow Cap (up to a maximum of 50M units)\n2) GHO Borrow Rate\n3) GSM Exposure Cap\n4) GSM Bucket Capacity\n5) GSM Price Strategy \n6) GSM Fee Strategy \n7) GSM Price Range (Freeze, Unfreeze)\n\nDecisions are made when 3 of 4 above are in agreement whereby @karpatkey_TokenLogic will be using a nested multi-sig (2 of 2).\n\n@karpatkey_TokenLogic will gladly share these decisions and their rationale in this thread.\n    \n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] GHO - Increase Borrow Rate\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & ACI - @MarcZeller\ncreated: 2023-10-30\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes increasing the GHO Borrow Rate from 3.00% to 4.72%, the proposed sDAI rate.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past week, the GHO peg has been gradually declining, while the supply has been increasing. Users have been minting GHO and subsequently exchanging it for other assets.\n\nIncremental interest rate hikes have not had the desired effect, evident by GHO price continuing to trade lower. The GHO borrowing rate remains significantly lower compared to other stablecoins.\n\nThis publication suggests aligning the GHO borrowing rate with the proposed sDAI rate, 4.72%. The aim is to reduce the borrowing discount of GHO relative to other stablecoins before returning to periodic 50bps increases.\n\nThe chart below shows the general GHO price downwards trend. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByIPGWaz6.png)\n\nThe below shows the borrow rate of GHO relative to other stable coins. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryZgQWazp.png)\n\nThe main types of collateral backing GHO are wstETH (29.68%), wETH (28.84%), wBTC (20.44%) and rETH (8.94%). For reference, sDAI makes up 2.07% of the collateral supporting GHO debt with a current APR of [5.0%](https://daistats.com/#/ecosystem) which is expected to adjust lower to 4.72%. A large portion of the collateral backing GHO is generating yield which acts to offset borrowing costs.\n\nBy increasing the borrow rate to 4.72%, the goal is to improve the peg by reducing the incentive to mint GHO relative to other stable coins. As a result, GHO's growth is expected to slow. This publication prioritises returning GHO to peg over growth. \n\nAfter implementing this proposal, the community can continue with the current plan, [direct-to-AIP process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/349/). \n\n# Specification\n\nAsset: GHO\nContract Address: [0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f)\nCurrent Borrow Rate: [3.00%](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1255fC8DC8E76761995aCF544eea54f1B7fB0459#readContract)\nProposed Borrow Rate: 4.72%\nNew discounted Borrow Rate: ~3.31%\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\nThe Aave Facilitator Bucket Level is to remain at 35.00M units\n\nThe AIP will be submitted by @marcZeller and the ACI team.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2) In 5 days scalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage.\n3) If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.\n\nWith market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.\n\nDo note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.\n\n| Asset | Current RF| Recommended RF | \n| ---  | ---    |---     |\n| 1INCH| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| AMPL | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BUSD | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BAL  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| BAT  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CRV  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CVX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| DAI  | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| DPI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENS  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENJ  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FEI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FRAX | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| GUSD | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| KNC  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| LINK | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| LUSD | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| MANA | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| MKR  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| RAI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| REN  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| renFIL| 35.00%| 99.99% |\n| SNX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| sUSD | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| SUSHI| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| TUSD | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| UNI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| USDC | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| USDP | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| USDT | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| UST  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| wBTC | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| wETH | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| YFI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ZRX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n4) Subsequent AIP submission are expected to follow every 14 days thereafter\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nThe below details various proposals reflecting Llama's efforts to date:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n* [ARFC MaticX Polygon v3 Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555)\n* [ARFC MaticX SupplyCap Increase Polygon v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-supplycap-increase-polygon-v3/12217/12)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nThe below chart shows the growth of MaticX supply on both Ethereum and Polygon. The recent spike in Polygon circulating supply is the result of the previous Supply Cap discussion on Aave v3 governance forum and the resulting outreach to various whales. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HzidlG1.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7KgR8XR.png)\n\nThe chart shows a clear growth since 16th February when SD rewards were initiated. There is a clear link between SD emissions on Aave v3 and MaticX growth.\n\nUsing the [Chaos Labs Updated Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-updated-supply-and-borrow-cap-methodology/11602) the MaticX Supply Cap can be increased from 17.2M units to 34.4M units. Doubling of the Supply Cap is acheived by overlooking the limitations of circulating supply and focusing on liquidity which follows the rational of the previous Supply Cap adjustment. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xW01WDf.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iMHRNbO.png)\nRatio exceeds 2.0 and thus, maximum increase in the Supply Cap is 100%.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave's exposure to MaticX over time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters have been proposed by Llama for the community to review and discuss in the comments section.\n\nTicker: MaticX\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0xfa68FB4628DFF1028CFEc22b4162FCcd0d45efb6`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6)\n\nOption 1 - 19.6M Supply Cap\nOption 2 - 29.3M Supply Cap\nOption 3 - NAE\nOption 4 - ABSTAIN\n\nOption 1 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\nOption 2 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\n\nPlease do read over the comments on the governance forum and review the vote linked [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) before casting a vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "**Title: [ARFC] GHO Steward: Agile Parameter Changes**\n\n**Author: [@AaveCompanies](https://governance.aave.com/u/aavecompanies)**\n\n**Date: 12th July 2023**\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes implementing the dedicated GHO Steward as a dynamic parameter change mechanism to ensure efficient risk management and support the peg of Aave Protocol’s native multi-collateral stablecoin GHO during the initial stages.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nAs the Aave DAO prepares for the introduction of GHO, it is crucial for the community to consider implementing a mechanism that offers greater agility to adjust risk parameters in the initial stages of launch.\n\nTo support the maintenance of the peg, the proposed GHO Steward multisig acts as a dynamic parameter change mechanism. It enables swift adjustments to risk parameters in the form of scoped governance delegation where the full governance process could potentially be time-consuming and hinder timely response to evolving circumstances.\n\nBy employing this mechanism, the Aave Protocol ensures transparency and enables flexible parameter changes through decentralized governance. This approach reinforces commitment to preserving the peg and effectively addressing market challenges that may arise upon the launch of GHO.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\nThe “bucket capacity” refers to the maximum amount of GHO that can be minted by a Facilitator. The ability to adapt the bucket capacity by adjusting supply supports stability by ensuring that available supply meets demand.\n\nThe “borrow rate” refers to the interest rate paid when borrowing GHO. The borrowing rate may also be used to support stability because of its impact on demand.\n\nYou can learn more about GHO in the docs [here](https://docs.gho.xyz/).\n\n### **GHO Steward Permissions**\n\nAave V3 provides a high level of granularity around permissions. Building on the concept of [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/4), it is proposed that a dedicated GHO Steward multisig be introduced to support the initial GHO governance risk mechanism to enable the implementation of agile parameter changes in the form of scoped governance delegation.\n\nThe GHO Steward multisig would be 2/2 and would include the DAO’s risk providers Chaos Labs and Gauntlet.\n\nThe GHO Steward would be capable of adjusting predefined parameters including: increasing the bucket capacity (by up to 100%) and changing the borrow rate (by up to 100 basis points in either direction) in a single change. Parameter updates could only occur once every 5 days per the parameter.\n\nIt is proposed that the GHO Steward would be deactivated 90 days after the passing of this proposal. However, the DAO can vote to renew the GHO Steward for another 90 days if deemed necessary. The DAO can also vote to remove the GHO Steward at any time.\n\n### **Governance Process**\n\nThis proposal emphasizes the importance of decentralization and community involvement in the decision-making process, fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem. The GHO Risk Steward would enable agile parameter changes for GHO; however, decisions shouldn’t be made in isolation and should go through a lean governance process.\n\nThe proposed lean process is as follows:\n\n1. Proposal on the Governance Forum explaining the rationale of the proposed action.\n2. Snapshot requirements:\n    \n    a. 24-hour duration starting from the posting of the proposal\n    \n    b. Quorum 250,000 AAVE\n    \n    c. A minimum of 70% of votes FOR the change\n    \n3. Change can be enacted as soon as the proposal passes Snapshot.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the GHO Steward serves as an initial agile parameter change mechanism driven by decentralized governance. It highlights the Aave Protocol’s commitment to maintaining GHO stability and addressing market challenges during the launch period.\n\nWhile the proposal acknowledges the potential for a more dynamic rate-changing governance model in the future, the current framework allows the DAO to effectively manage GHO’s parameters in the short term.\n\n## **Specification**\n\n### **Capabilities:**\n\n1. **Capacity Increase:** It can increase the bucket capacity by up to 100%. This is strictly an upward adjustment; the capacity cannot be decreased by the GHO Steward.\n2. **Borrow Rate Adjustment:** It can adjust the borrow rate by up to 1%, either upwards or downwards.\n\n### **Configuration:**\n\n1. **Permissions:** The GHO Steward is granted PoolAdmin in the Aave Protocol and BucketManager for the GHO token.\n2. **Risk Council:** This Multisig is solely responsible for triggering actions through the GHO Steward contract. The address of this entity cannot be changed.\n3. **Execution Time Delay:** Any parameter change made by the GHO Steward contract, such as increasing bucket capacity or adjusting the borrow rate, is limited to once within the time delay period. e.g.,GHO Steward can only change a parameter once 5 days have passed since the last parameter change for that specific parameter.\n4. **Lifespan:** The GHO Steward contract will initially only have a lifespan of 90 days. The lifespan is designed to ensure regular review of the necessity of this approach.\n5. **Steward Lifespan Extension:** The DAO can extend the lifespan of the GHO Steward for additional 90-day periods as many times as it wants.\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nN/A\n\n### **Links**\n\n- Codebase: [GitHub](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/src/contracts/misc/GhoSteward.sol)\n- Audit Report: [GitHub](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/13-06-2023_SigmaPrime_GhoSteward.pdf)\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to AIP stage.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
