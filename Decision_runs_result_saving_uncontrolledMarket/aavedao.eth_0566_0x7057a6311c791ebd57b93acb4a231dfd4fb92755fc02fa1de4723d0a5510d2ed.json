Enabling borrowing with a reasonable BorrowCap and the introduction of borrowing rewards, will lead to significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. \n\nThis proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards are expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below proposals details are applicable:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nIn support of the upcoming liquidity rewards distribution, this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap, enable borrowing and introduce a BorrowCap sufficient to create a notable deposit yield.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GSWOAxP.png)\n\nDetailed analysis can be found on the governance forum, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters are being proposed and have been reviewed by [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555/6).\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Loan To Value|58.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|67.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|SupplyCap|8.6M units|\n|Borrowing|Enabled|\n|BorrowingCap|5.2M|\n\nThe following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Slope1|4.00%|\n|Slope2|150.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |0.50%|\n|Stable Slope2 |150.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |2.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00%|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2022-12-17\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1]. As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode.\n\nThis proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens.\n\nUtilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 72.5%. At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAO’s revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost.\n\nIncreasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300%. Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility.\n\nThe breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative.\n\nThe capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3].\n\nBased upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65%. It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65%. The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZloZ51jG8cSo9pK37apk9xqwSnyM2T6WwKWEaimSNA8sVpcxxsRrQBYPf9F6DAFMzXPdlhRWwNePF_5kZrTEoZu8-rfk3CmDtTivdrrwTTQGrAe-ZoZ1to1PlsAaFfbkmQLeRdOAy0qukls3wJAXFgKgCA6TUd6jP2w6mbO4WWKOguI0RjWEQ7BkIg \"Chart\")\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the wMATIC Reserve.\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n|---|---|---|\n|Uoptimal|45%|75%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|6.1%|\n|Slope2|300%|100%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|20%|\n|Supply Cap|32.88M|47M|\n|Borrow Cap|9.23M|39.95M|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx\n[3] https://lido.fi/\n[4] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [4].",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @scottincrypto\nDated: 2022-12-17 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend BAL interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3 and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere is currently a high demand for borrowing BAL (interest rate = 28.18% on Polygon v3) across all Reserves. The BAL liquidity pools offer poor capital efficiency, with the utilization of the Reserve ([48.27%](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x9a71012b13ca4d3d0cdc72a177df3ef03b0e76a3&marketName=proto_polygon_v3) on Polygon v3) often near the Optimal point of 45%.\n\nBy changing the interest rate curve across all three active Liquidity Pools, this proposal is expected to improve capital efficiency by lowering interest rates on markets where borrowing is disabled and enticing capital to move to where borrowing demand generates an attractive yield. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and generate significant capital efficiency within the BAL Reserves.\n\nDue to the ongoing incentives offered by Aura Finance, any new deposits are expected to be borrowed. Users are able to borrow and deposit BAL into [Aura Finance’s staking contract](https://app.aura.finance/) to earn a yield of around 45% at the time of writing. This creates an arbitrage opportunity of 16.82% taking into account the liquidation risk, auraBAL peg and additional Smart Contract risk.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUsers are expected to continue borrowing BAL to earn yield whilst interest rates permit and, in doing so, will create ongoing borrowing demand for BAL. Changing the interest rate curve by amending the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will improve the capital efficiency of Reserves. However, with borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it is rational for profit driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield.\n\nThe three charts below show the most recent 5 month historical BAL interest rate across each BAL Reserve. The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 28.18% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14% which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pyLdQvS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6sNc6ku.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eAG1lOG.png)\n\nIn addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at 0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a BAL interest rate similar to the SNX interest rate curve which has a base 3%, slope 1 12% and slope 2 100%.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b3kks7y.png)\n\nUtilization of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 73.33% assuming users can borrow BAL and are willing to pay an interest rate of 13%, which is less than the current borrowing rate of 28.18%. With a borrowing cost of 14% at the Optimal point, depositing BAL into Aura Finance’s auraBAL staking contract or B-80BAL-20wETH / auraBAL gauge will remain lucrative for users. If the utilization exceeds the Uoptimal point, a follow up proposal will propose increasing the interest rate further.\n\nThe improved capital efficiency of the BAL Reserve is expected to lead to an increase in BAL liquidity on-chain. The more on-chain liquidity there is, the more expensive it is to manipulate an oracle feed. Based upon the @ChaosLabs Borrow Cap formula, Llama proposes increasing the Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 from  96,798.00 units to 256,140.00 units.\n\nWith respect to the Polygon v3 deployment, assuming the BAL Reserve remains at $979,230, the revenue generated at the Optimal point for the DAO will increase from $6.17k to $20.4k, or 230%.

This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled.  \n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, $279k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the more conservative of the two risk service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.56B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.81B) and ETH ($1.39B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Arbitrum. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and $279k during January 2023.\n\n\n\n\nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum. The parameters shown below are a combination of Gauntlet’s and Chao’s work and utilise the same interest rate proposed by Llama for wstETH on Arbitrum.\n\n\nGauntlet’s and Chao’s combined but differing risk assessments can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-arbitrum-aave-v3/11387/7).\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled| Yes|\n|Supply Cap (in tokens)| 1,200|\n|Borrow Cap (in tokens)| 190|\n|Debt Ceiling| 0|\n|LTV| 70.0%|\n|LT| 79.0%|\n|Liquidation Bonus| 7.2%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee |10%|\n\n\n### ETH eMode Category\n\n\n|Category|Assets Included|Loan to Value|Liquidation Threshold|Liquidation Bonus|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ethereum Correlated|wstETH wETH|90%|93%|2%|\n\n\n### Borrow Rates\n\n\n|Category|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Slope1|4.50%|\n|Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. \n\nThis proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch). The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aave’s wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YQpHY0c.png)\n\nThe market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below:\n\n* Structured products charge a fee\n* Additional smart contract risk\n* Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity\n\nOur analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed.\n\n\n\nThis proposal intends to reduce the Slope1 parameters on the v2 market to 3.8% and introduce a Base of 1%. The borrowing rate at the Upotimal point is reduced from 5.75% to 4.8% (Base + Slope1). Introducing a Base, with a Lower Slope1 (4.8% < 5.75%) parameter, acts to reduce the gradient between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal compared to having a Slope1 = Base + Lower Slope1. \n\nThe graphic below shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curves.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/72v0mJr.png)\n\nThe graphic below shows the proposed interest rate with Base, Slope1 and Slope2 parameters detailed.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BKd9DUk.png)\n\nIt is worth noting that borrowing wETH becomes slightly more expensive at lower utilization compared to the current wETH interest rate. When utilization is less than 41% borrowing costs are higher, ranging 0 to 0.98%, and when utilization is greater than 41% borrowing costs are lower, ranging 0 to 0.95%. Current utilization is 46% on the v2 deployment which means the borrowing costs would be reduced.\n\nThe chart below shows the relative change in borrowing costs for users, comparing the current versus the proposed interest rate curve.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6XyC2Hn.png)\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curve for the Ethereum v2 and v3 deployment.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|80.00|80.00|\n|Base|0.00|1.00|\n|Slope1|5.75|3.80|\n|Slope2|80.00|80.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00|15.00|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
