This is an updated proposal based on the feedback that was received. The main changes that has been made from the previous proposal are:\n\n* The Events & Sponsorship budget and activities have been removed.\n* Swapping the AAVE portion of funding with stables.\n* Introducing a $20k max grant size.\n\n# Summary\n\nAn opportunity to continue Aave Grants DAO (AGD) for 6 months by preserving the current AGD treasury holdings, providing $400,000 of new funding in ARB, and increasing AGD’s stablecoin allowance by $328,000.\n\nThis proposal will enable AGD to deliver and improve upon the top tier grants program the Aave ecosystem has had over the past 2+ years and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem. AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the previous proposal, AGD has:\n\n* Awarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.\n\n* Engaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.\n\n* Proliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.\n\n* Exercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.\n\nThis proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:\n\n* Providing new funding of $400,000 in ARB (~18% of the total ARB received by Aave DAO)\n\n* Increasing AGD’s stablecoin allowance by $328,000.\n\n# History\n\n![Timeline|1280x490](upload://8UmNLA3q2rDe51LE1bpp2iCpUOh.jpeg)\n\nSince its inception in May 2021, AGD has awarded $4,852,753 across 249 grants.\n\nFrom the last AGD proposal in January 2023 to now, AGD has awarded 50 grants and awarded 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties across four different hackathons.\n\n*Note: All $ cost amounts are calculated at time of payment, pre/post token value fluctuations are not included unless otherwise specified. Pending payments are not included.\n\nThis is the fifth proposal for AGD:\n\n* The[ initial proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-community-grants-program/3642) launched AGD in May 2021 with $1 million of total funding over two quarters.\n\n* The[ second proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-update-and-renewal/6371) was executed at the end of December 2021 and funded AGD for three months with $2 million of funding.\n\n* The[ third proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-dao-update-and-renewal/7842) was executed at the end of May 2022 and funded AGD for six months with $3 million per quarter.\n\n* The[ fourth proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289) was executed at the end of January 2023 and funded AGD for six months with $1.625 million per quarter.\n\n# Mission\n\nAGD is a community-led grants program that supports the growth of the Aave ecosystem by:\n\n(1) Funding innovative projects backed by strong teams with creative ideas that benefit and strengthen the Aave ecosystem through products and initiatives which:\n\n* Increase TVL or other protocol metrics\n\n* Expand the capabilities of the platform and utility of Aave\n\n* Empower the community with accessible and novel insights\n\n* Engage new users and enhance retention of current users\n\n* Grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity\n\nAND\n\n(2) Fostering a strong and inclusive culture around Aave. Aave's culture leads to:\n\n* Attracting and retaining the best contributors, and\n\n* Encouraging the development of new and creative solutions to key areas in the Aave protocol and Aave DAO.\n\n# Metrics\n\n**Grants Provided:**\n\n* Since May 2021: 249 grants worth $4,845,753\n\n* Since Jan 2023: 50 grants worth $885,020\n\n* Breakdown of grants by category:\n\n  * Category - $cumulative cost - number approved\n\n  * Applications and integrations - $2,664,556 - 108 grants\n\n  * Code audits - $82,000 - 3 grants\n\n  * Committees & DAOs that serve Aave’s ecosystem - $703,780 - 18 grants\n\n  * Community (marketing and educational) - $698,550 - 52 grants\n\n  * Developer tooling - $415,000 - 13 grants\n\n  * Events / Hackathons / Sponsorships - $185,000 - 14 grants\n\n  * Other - $294,900 - 12 grants\n\n  * Protocol development - $474,200 - 21 grants\n\n**Status of all Grant Projects Awarded:**\n\n* Complete/Live - 67.6%\n\n* In-progress - 24.8%\n\n* Inactive - 7.6%\n\n**Growth in Community Engagement Since Last Renewal Proposal (Jan 2023):**\n\n* Substack subscribers: 1,748 → 1,805 (+ 3%)\n\n* Twitter followers: 13,300 → 13,400 (+ 0.75%)\n\n* Telegram members: 643 → 719 (+ 12%)\n\n* Lens followers: 2,828 → 8,801 (+ 211%)\n\n* Mirror subscribers: 169 → 546 (+ 223%)\n\n**Key Stats Since Inception:**\n\n* Participated in 14 hackathons, awarding $150,000 in Aave and GHO specific bounties to 58 teams.\n\n  * Many of these teams have continued building or contributing to Aave and GHO, including five projects that went on to receive grants.\n\n* Achieved a Net Promoter Score, a measurement to gauge the experience of grantees, of 83 based on 77 responses.\n\n  * Average response to “How likely are you to recommend AGD?” is 4.8/5.\n\n* Processed 1,944 applications with an average turnaround time from application submission to grant decision of 9.6 days, shrinking over time.\n\n* Consistently accepted applications and awarded grants to builders:\n\n![AGD Proposal Received Since Inception - As of Sept 4 2023|2000x368](upload://n03ZA93GH9RxzfcLaBSYBdBnLoX.jpeg)\n\n![Grants accepted by quarter - As of Sept 4 2023|2000x371](upload://za6UB8Bgrv5fm25iKl2Zb0ePqZw.jpeg)\n\n# Since the Last Proposal\n\nThe community has been kept up to date with AGD’s[ activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-recent-work-updates/11585), the[ Halfway Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-april-2023-halfway-updates/13683), and through AGD being added to[ Llama’s treasury dashboard](https://community.llama.xyz/aave/grants). The [AGD website](https://aavegrants.org/) houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.\n\nThe GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.\n\n## AGD Budget\n\nAGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,450,895. Part of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.\n\n![Average Grant Size Over Time.png|1606x984](upload://A28z92ug5DZZaQFNkv39J3DBzU5.jpeg)\n\nHere is a breakdown of AGD’s spend versus what was budgeted:\n\n![Budgeted vs Spent|1280x395](upload://yxP25hD2WEZRrNTbH6wYOefQMG1.jpeg)\n\nHere is AGD’s spend over the course of the previous proposal:\n\n![Q6 & Q7 Breakdown|1280x485](upload://uwGvstmQoJAemBhNw11vhTndBLi.jpeg)\n\n## Other Initiatives\n\n* **Increasing Grantee Accountability.** There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently [Defi Simulator](https://governance.aave.com/t/introduction-defi-simulator/13166), [Projection Finance](https://governance.aave.com/t/introduction-blockchain-education-network-aave-tutorials-learning-content/14448), and [Aave Alarm](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-mobile-notifier-app/14082)) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.\n\n* **‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs).** [A pilot project has been introduced](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-request-for-grants-by-aave-grants-dao-gho-governance-op/14125) to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.\n\n* **AGD Operations and Best Practices.** Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:\n\n![Process|1280x466](upload://AbmHHvqATIWjmJubiH87yZgGKvX.jpeg)\n\n# Grantee Highlights\n\nSince AGD’s last proposal, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.\n\n![Grants by Category|1280x856](upload://p42bwb2ZXMR7EZCIoR8rgS3v76B.jpeg)\n\nHere are some recent highlights from grantees:\n\n**[Dullahan](https://dullahan.paladin.vote/)**\n\nDesigned and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and has over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.\n\n**[Sommelier Finance](https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Real-Yield-ETH/manage)**\n\nEnables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.\n\n**[AAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools](https://dapp.cian.app/strategy/maticleveraged/create)**\n\nExpands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.\n\nOther applications include: [DeFi Simulator](https://defisim.xyz/), [Aave Alarm](https://github.com/nebolax/aavealarm), [Projection Finance](https://aavev3.projection.finance/) and [Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard](https://aave.karmahq.xyz/).\n\n**[IntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO](https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/metrics/ethereum/aave_gho)**\n\nHelps the community understand GHO's activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.\n\n**[Xenophon Labs](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-raising-the-safety-module-s-slashing-percentage/14167)**\n\nPerformed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year\n\n**[Butter](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732/19)**\n\nFacilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.\n\n**[Senate](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb5da30d8d949c3f00f4a34cd68cdddba9e64dfaf47f75ab3bd8d164fcd001279)**\n\nReducing the friction of engaging with Aave governance by implementing their notification and alert system in the governance forum.\n\n**[Flexible aToken Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting/blob/master/src/ATokenFlexVoting.sol)** ScopeLift\n\nUnlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.\n\n**[AwesomeQA](https://home.awesomeqa.xyz/)**\n\nStreamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.\n\n# Operational Focuses for this Proposal\n\nThe path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:\n\n**Finish Establishing Legal Entity**\n\nEstablishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.\n\nAGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.\n\n**Revamping Review Committee**\n\nAGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. [One idea AGD will explore](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-further-decentralising-the-aave-grants-dao/14452/22) is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.\n\n**AGD and Service Provider Alignment**\n\nWith the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.\n\n**Measuring Impact**\n\nAGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as [Spindl](https://www.spindl.xyz/) to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.\n\nStarting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.\n\n# People\n\nAGD now has ten members.\n\n* Lead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.\n\n* Review Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:\n\n* Corbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys\n\n* Calvin Chu - Impossible Finance\n\n* Francis Gowen - Flipside Crypto\n\n* Lawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics\n\n* Kakashi - Symphony\n\n* Andrew Allen - Coinbase\n\n* David Truong - [x23.ai](https://x23.ai/), ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev\n\n* Operations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.\n\n* Analyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\n* Lead: $9k/month\n\n* Review committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week\n\n  * Reviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.\n\n* Analyst: $5k/month\n\n* Operations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month\n\n* Designer and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements\n\nThe roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.\n\n# Proposed Budgets\n\nThis proposal's total budget will be split between a Grants Budget, an Events & Sponsorship Budget, and an Operations Budget. In total across all three budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:\n\n* $400,000 in ARB\n\n* $328,000 increase in AGD’s stablecoin allowance\n\nThis would make AGD's treasury, including allowances 64.6% in stables, 11.5% in AAVE, and 23.9% in ARB & OP.\n\n$292,000 that was previously allocated to 'Digital Marketing' spend has been reallocated to this budget.\n\nNotably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to [swap AGD's DAI allowance with GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-replace-agd-s-dai-allowance-with-gho-allowance/14631). AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.\n\n## Grants Budget\n\n|                    \t| Carry Forward | Ask    \t| Tokens for Ask |\n|------------------------|---------------|------------|----------------|\n| Developer Grants   \t| $614,980  \t| $300,000   | Stables    \t|\n|                    \t| $133,000  \t| $0     \t| OP         \t|\n|                    \t| $0        \t| $400,000   | ARB        \t|\n| **Grants Total Budgeted Cost** | **$747,980**\t| **$700,000**   |            \t|\n\n\n\nThe OP is based on the 100,000 OP[ allocated to AGD during the previous proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-allocation-of-300k-op-received-by-aave-grants-dao/12820). In line with the total amount of OP AGD has (300,000 OP), AGD is requesting $400,000 in ARB tokens to support the growth and development of projects building on top of Aave on Arbitrum. This is equivalent to ~18% of the total ARB received (at current prices) and is in line with the[ community’s preference](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xea8b9cc41076ba43c8a66dfd40ce539b3126af049639babce6c1fa3e62585b79) to allocate the full amount of ARB received across multiple options. Any ARB unspent during this proposal will be kept in the AGD treasury and allocated to future proposals.\n\nAGD will introduce a new $20k max grant size for all grants and double down on kickstarting the growth of new teams building on top of Aave and GHO.\n\n## Operations Budget\n\n|                                             \t| Carry Forward | Ask   \t| Tokens for Ask |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Compensation                                \t| $20,150   \t| $300,000  | Stables    \t|\n| Maintenance: Tooling, subscriptions, gas reimbursements | $526     \t| $20,000   | Stables    \t|\n| Legal Buffer                                \t| $69,984   \t| $0    \t|    \t|\n| **Operations Total Budgeted Cost**          \t| **$90,660**   | **$320,000** |            \t|\n\n\nIncreasing the overall amount allocated to operations, especially compensation, is necessary for AGD to grow its resources and operate more independently.\n\n\n# Next Steps\n\n* Get community feedback on TEMP CHECK\n\n* **Snapshot vote** <- we are here\n\n* If Snapshot is successful then move to AIP",

Currently, the SM is overly concentrated in AAVE via direct AAVE staking and ABPT staking which is a Balancer v1 80/20 AAVE/wETH liquidity token.\n\nThis publication seeks to explore the community's appetite to diversify the SM asset base and vary the portion of users' funds which can be auctioned in the event of a shortfall. Currently, 30% of user deposits are at risk when depositing into the SM.\n\n# Motivation\n\n@bgdlabs is currently proposing to upgrade the [SM architecture](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12148) to support the launch of GHO, by enabling stkAAVE holders to access cheaper GHO borrowing rates. Further to this, Llama has kick started the conversation around migrating AAVE liquidity from Balancer v1 to v2 in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-safety-module-update-part-i-migrate-aave-weth-balancer-v1-pool-to-balancer-v2/12748).\n\nSeveral comments relating to the AAVE concentration and auction mechanism have been made on the forum which can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/size-x-aave-auction-safety-module/11984), [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-extend-safety-module-coverage-to-polygon-v3/11876/4).\n\nThis publication presents three distinct categories for inclusion in the SM.\n\n* Single Asset\n* Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions\n* Stable Asset Liquidity Positions\n\nThe net change to the existing implementation is the introduction of a third category, Stable Asset Liquidity Positions. The existing AAVE and ABPT represent Single Asset and Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions.\n\nAlthough any Liquidity Provider (LP) position can be included, G-Uni, crvLP, BPT etc… This publication will initially focus on the overarching concept and how BPTs could be integrated.\n\nBPTs were selected due to Aave’s relationship with Balancer DAO and the veBAL holding which the community may elect to utilize here. It should be stressed, Aave DAO will elect which assets are to be included and the varying levels of slashing for each category.\n\nAssets considered for inclusion should have minimal counterparty risk and display great on-chain liquidity amongst other considerations such as price correlation with Aave Protocol’s TVL during varying market conditions.\n\nLlama proposes three initial asset categories to be created within the SM.\n\nThe slashing parameters update aims to reduce the price impact on the AAVE token in the case of a shortfall event. We propose adding different levels of slashing to each category, as follows:\n\n## Single Assets\n\nThe current single asset, with 30% slashing, is AAVE. This proposal introduces other assets to this category with the goal of reducing the concentration of AAVE inside the insurance fund.\n\nPossible assets for consideration inside the SM Single Asset Category include, not limited to:\n\n* AAVE\n* ETH and/or wstETH\n\nIf the community elects with the introduction of additional assets other than AAVE, then each asset could be considered individually. This publication retains the 30% slashing feature for Single Asset.\n\nThe inclusion of wstETH may attract additional incentives from Lido DAO, therefore Llama prefers having the ability to distribute multiple rewards types with external teams able to distribute their own token. Something similar to the Emission Admin role on Aave v3 will suffice.\n\nLlama preference is for wstETH over wETH due to improved capital efficiency by enabling users to earn an overall higher APY from being a SM depositor. wstETH has become a major trading pairing token on Balancer and it has ample liquidity across various pools to route swaps through. Additionally, the stETH-ETH discount has reduced significantly (0.9938:1 for 100K ETH sold, which also demonstrates [very deep liquidity](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=ethereum&from=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&to=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).\n\nLlama would also encourage Lido DAO to indicate any potential support for this type of integration between the two protocols as inclusion in the SM would act to help retain or grow wstETH adoption via the creation of a unique use case for wstETH relative to other LSTs.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 30% retained for single assets.\n\nInitial assets proposed: AAVE / ETH and/or stETH\n\n## Risks Considerations\n\nIf LSTs (such as wstETH) are included in the SM, it creates a price divergence risk which, if sustained, can reduce the cover in the SM and create an unfair distribution of the rewards between ETH & wstETH. Post redemption the main risk consideration for LSTs becomes counterparty risk which if it materialized would lead to a significant discount to the LST price in ETH terms.\n\n* To limit the de-peg risk, the SM could stop incentivizing below a defined ratio, so the total value would then be deduced from the total cover value. This acts to mitigate counterparty risk without requiring governance intervention.\n\nBased upon technical feedback relating to the ease of implementation, Llama may revise this section of the publication.\n\n## Volatile Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn addition to the replacement pool for the 80/20 AAVE/wETH pool on Balancer v1, to be determined by an earlier publication. This publication presents two other pools of strategic importance to Aave DAO for inclusion in the SM.\n\nThis publication presents the prospect of creating an 80/20 GHO/wETH (or wstETH) which offers less impermanent loss than a 50/50 pool whilst also providing very deep liquidity for risk off events which see spikes in stable coin swap volumes which can often lead to stable coins trading above $1.\n\nFor the following categories, up to 75% of the current budget could be allocated.\n\nMax slashing proposed 45% for volatile BPTs\n\nInitial volatile BPTs proposed: B-80AAVE-20wstETH (or Part I proposal results) & B-80GHO-20WETH\n\nEven if not yet created, this is probably the most interesting addition to this category as the trading volume of this pool will generate an important yield for LPs. The second pool could also be converted into a [Balancer Core Pool](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) by replacing ETH by IBTs as described in Part I.\n\n## Stable Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn this third category, this publication presents an initial pool consisting of the Balancer [3pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x79c58f70905f734641735bc61e45c19dd9ad60bc0000000000000000000004e7) and GHO. Like other categories, in the future, additional assets can be added. If the community elects to launch BB-A-USD/GHO on Balancer or a stable coin pool on Curve, then this section can pivot to include the Curve pool.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 60% for stable\n\nInitial Stable BPT proposed: B-3Pool/GHO\n\nThis pool introduces a stable asset to the SM design and generates a significant amount of the coverage as 60% of the TVL can be slashed with very low price impact across the broader ecosystem. This is especially the case if something like Cowswap’s auction mechanism was to feature in the new SM auction mechanism.\n\nBy integrating a GHO pair to the SM, Aave is essentially helping bootstrapping GHO adoptions through incentivised liquidity. Aave will also earn revenue from the GHO borrowing rate.\n\nIf the community elects to proceed with 3CRV/GHO, then this would increase the SM smart contract surface area through diversifying exposure concentration away from Balancer to include Cuve Finance and potentially Convex Finance risk as well.\n\nThere is also the option of adding additional pools which could include GHO, MAI, LUSD, FRAX and others once live like crvUSD etc…\n\nThis proposal can be implemented independently from the following parts. In this case, “classic” gauges would be advised. Otherwise, the strategy & smBPT gauges discussions will be outlined & discussed in Part III.\n\n# Technical Specifications:\n\n* Remove the BPT 80/20 from the current main module (30% slashing)\n* Deploy two other modules on the SM for the new categories (45% & 60% slashing)\n* Implement the new assets voted on Part II for the new categories\n* Create the new pools depending on vote results\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Implement Changes\nNAE- Rework Proposal\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH.\n\nLSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.\n\nOnboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.\n\nAave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.\n\nRocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem.\n\nSpecification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal.\nIncreasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions.\n\nthe ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators.\nRocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH\nrETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH.\nThe rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time.\nSimply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.\nWithout a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.\nRocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold.\nAbstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nrETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.\nrETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.\nrETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.\nrETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.\nrETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years.\nThe Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021.\nrETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2\nThe Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool — Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2\n5. How is the rETH token currently used?\n\nBalancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M\n\nUniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity\n\nrETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI\n\nimage\nimage\n1231×203 17.2 KB\nIt’s likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding.\n\nSee the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\nrETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\nThe Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities.\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $287 118 738\n24H Volume ~$3.75M\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\n\nExchanges:\n\nBalancer (main source of liquidity)\nUniswap\nCurve\nBancor\nFurther information here: Rocket Pool Explorer 4 2 and Dune 1\n\n9.

Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.\n\nBorrowable - Yes\n\nWe are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aave’s markets.\n\nLT - 74%; LTV 67%\n\nWe recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we’ve identified above.\n\nLB - 7.5%\n\nWe recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH.\n\nRF - 15%\n\nLPF - 0.1\n\nDebt Ceiling - NA\n\nSupply Cap - 10K\n\nBorrow Cap - 1200\n\nOur analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets.\n\n| Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap |\n| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |\n| rETH   | NO             | YES        | YES                | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A         | 10K       | 1200      |\n\n\n## Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor\n\nrETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later.\n\nParameter | Recommendation\n--------- | -------------\nBase | 0\nSlope 1 | 0.07\nUoptimal | 0.45\nSlope 2 | 3.0\nReserve Factor | 0.15\n\nUnder these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI). From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.",

This partnership began with our original [engagement to cover V3 markets](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025), followed by an [extension to cover V2 markets formally](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/), with an additional [engagement amendment](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-scope-and-compensation-amendment/14407) approved by the community in August 2023 to adjust the scope and compensation for the remainder of the original term. \n\nDuring this time, we have consistently demonstrated our unwavering dedication to the DAO, covering all aspects of the protocol across all deployments and providing the community with proactive risk parameter recommendations alongside reactive analyses and risk-mitigating strategies in light of significant market events. Chaos has initiated over 60 ARFCs and supported nearly 100 additional proposals and community discussions, including parameter optimization, onboarding of new assets and new deployments, deprecation of V2 and migration to V3, GHO launch, and community support during major market events.\n\nDuring our engagement, the protocol incurred minimal bad debt while facing major market events, namely the USDC depeg in early March 2023. \n\n💡 A full overview of Chaos Labs’ activities through the past year can be found in our monthly community updates [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-monthly-community-update/11174/6).\n\n## Highlighted previous work and resources\n\n### Products:\n\n- [Aave Risk Monitoring and Alerting Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/overview)\n- [Chaos Labs Asset Protection Tool](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-asset-protection-tool)\n- [Parameter Recommendations Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations)\n- [GHO Risk Monitoring Dashboard](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/GHO)\n\n### Methodologies:\n\n- [Chaos Labs’ Research](https://chaoslabs.xyz/research)\n- [Chaos Labs -

These simulations leverage protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. Thorough system analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven optimization and risk management recommendations. \n\nCoverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.\n\n**Parameter Recommendation Platform**\n\nThe Chaos Labs Parameter Recommendation Portal is designed to provide the Aave community with a comprehensive understanding of the simulation outputs and underlying data to optimize risk parameter settings. By providing a clear and intuitive interface that highlights the impact of different parameter settings on risk and return, we can foster a more informed and engaged community, facilitating ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing. \n\nIn addition to presenting the data outputs from the Chaos Simulation Engine, the Parameter Recommendation Portal offers users unparalleled access to the underlying simulation mechanics and implications, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the simulations and their results.\n\n### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWe offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health. \n\nAs part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.\n\n### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3\n\nChaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the 'Background' section. \n\nAs we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2. \n\nGiven the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.\n\n### **Protocol Growth**\n\nChaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n\nAs we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol's expansion and sustainability.\n\n### GHO\n\nFollowing the initial launch of GHO, Chaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:\n\n- **Parameter Optimization** - we will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.\n- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.\n- **Facilitator's Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - we will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.\n- **And more**\n\n### Chaos Team Support\n\nAs part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.\n\nOur team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response. In the event of any incidents or issues, our team will be on hand to provide timely and effective incident response, minimizing the potential impact on the protocol and its users.\n\n**Ongoing and Proactive Risk Management**\n\nThis includes detailed analyses of new asset onboarding, assessing the potential risks and benefits of launching in new markets and providing a thorough understanding of parameter recommendations, including qualitative data and position analysis. \n\n**Incident Response**\n\n This includes supporting various events, including liquidity changes, asset depegs, price volatilities, etc. Our team provides ongoing support in these events, including market monitoring and alerting, ad-hoc risk analysis, and recommendations on risk-mitigating actions.\n\nOur team of experts brings a wealth of experience in risk management and data analysis, enabling us to provide the insights and recommendations necessary to navigate even the most challenging market conditions. By working closely with the community, we can provide the support and guidance necessary to promote Aave’s long-term success and sustainability.\n\n## Communications:\n\n- Our team will share our recommendations and analyses through dedicated governance forum discussions, maintaining transparency and facilitating effective communication with the community.\n- We commit to providing a monthly update post, highlighting completed work and outlining our future areas of focus.\n- We are consistently available for community calls and regularly schedule check-up calls with Aave delegates. These calls primarily focus on addressing risk-related inquiries, offering insights into existing proposals, and gathering general feedback.\n\n## Terms\n\n- 12-month engagement, November 13th 2023-November 13th, 2024\n- $1.6M, streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n    - Given community preference, we suggest the full amount to be paid in GHO but are open to any composition of stables/AAVE tokens.\n\n## Specification:\n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (`0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0`) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 1,600,000 aUSDC or GHO for a 12-month duration.\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and Tashi.

        "body": "This proposal seeks to add KNC (Kyber Network Crystal) to Aave v3 on Ethereum.\n\nAuthors: Maxax; Shane\n\nDate: 12/09/2023\n\n## References\n\n* Project website: https://kyberswap.com/\n* Documentation: https://docs.kyberswap.com/\n* Github / source code: https://github.com/KyberNetwork\n* Ethereum contracts: [0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202)\n* Chainlink Oracle - KNC/USD Price Feed :[ 0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/knc-usd)\n\nAudits:\n\nBecause we are limited in the number of links, please find more information on our docs.\n\n* KyberDAO & KNC audit by Hacken\n* KyberSwap Elastic protocol audit by ChainSecurity\n* KyberSwap Classic protocol audit by ChainSecurity\n\n## Summary\n\nKyberSwap (Kyber Network’s flagship product) is a multi-chain DEX aggregator + concentrated liquidity platform, which aims to offer superior rates for traders and capital efficient returns for liquidity providers.\n\nKyber launched on Ethereum in February 2018 and is a pioneer in the DeFi space, developing one of the earliest decentralized exchange protocols (DEX) with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor. The team spearheaded the launch of WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) - the most popular ERC20 version of Bitcoin today (and a collateral asset on Aave V2 & V3), as well as developing liquidity pools on KyberSwap that offers concentrated liquidity and capital efficiency for any token pair. Kyber was the most used DeFi protocol in 2019 according to Binance Research and also part of the pioneer batch of Alliance DAO/DeFi Alliance mentors and Asia DeFi Network. Today, KyberSwap is one of the most popular DEX aggregators and liquidity platforms on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Base, and other chains.\n\nThis proposal aims to list the **[Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token]** as a supply and borrow collateral asset on Isolation Mode on Aave V3 Ethereum Market.\n\n## Motivations\n\nKyberSwap is one of the oldest and most popular DEX aggregators with an average of 500K web visitors per month. KyberSwap has already been deployed on 14 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and Base. Total trading volume has crossed $21B+ and current total value locked (TVL) on all chains is $60M+.\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on proposals to improve KyberSwap. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap and other ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated.\n\nKNC is a liquid asset with many token holders. KNC holders may want to obtain additional liquidity without selling KNC so that they can still capture potential upside in token value. With KNC supported on Aave, KNC holders can borrow funds e.g. GHO for a wide variety of DeFi use cases, such as margin trading or for new investment opportunities, all without selling their current holdings.\n\nWe are keen on a long-term, strategic relationship with Aave and adding KNC as a supply and borrow collateral asset in isolation mode is a good first step towards this objective.\n\n### Isolation mode\n\nAdding support for KNC on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow KNC holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their KNC position, attracting new KNC Deposits.\n\n### Specification\n\n**1- What is the link between the author of the TEMP CHECK and the Asset?**\n\nShane and Maxax are from the DAO & KNC Strategy team at Kyber Network, managing Kyber’s strategic efforts regarding the KyberDAO and KNC tokenomics for KNC holders.\n\nEmails: shane@kyber.network ; max@kyber.network Telegram: @shaneHk , @maxaxeth Twitter: shaneMkt, 0xmaxax\n\n**2- Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.**\n\nKyberSwap is Kyber Network's flagship product, a multi-chain DEX aggregator + liquidity platform offering optimal trade routes and returns for liquidity providers.\n\nBenefits\n\n* Traders: Enjoy superior swap rates as KyberSwap aggregates liquidity from various DEX pools, including KyberSwap's pools. KyberAI, an on-chain analytics tool created by the Kyberswap team, identifies potential trending tokens and trading opportunities, while providing insights into those tokens. Limit Orders help traders swap tokens at desired rates.\n* Liquidity Providers: LPs deposit tokens into liquidity pools and earn compounding fees. Pools are flexible and have features such as anti-sniping and concentrated liquidity, mimicking higher levels of liquidity and achieving better capital efficiency, volume, and returns. Compared to a typical AMM DEX, KyberSwap offers much better slippage for an equivalent pool and trade size and liquidity on KyberSwap would result in a much bigger positive impact on swap rates. AAVE token LPs can consider setting up a pool on KyberSwap to enjoy these advantages.\n* Developers: can integrate KyberSwap pools/farms and aggregation API into their wallets and DApps, providing superior rates for users.\n\nGeneral Stats\n\n* 60+ DeFi/GameFi Dapp integrations\n* $21 Billion+ lifetime trading volume\n* 500K web visits (Average last 3 months)\n* 7,000 average DAU\n* 15,000 average daily transactions\n* Current total TVL on all KyberSwap pools: $60M+\n* Total TVL from aggregated DEXes: $29B+\n\nAbout KNC\n\nToken Contract (Ethereum): 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on KyberDAO governance proposals that determine KyberSwap improvements, protocol upgrades, fee adjustments, and other crucial decisions.\n\nIn return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading activity on KyberSwap. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated. KNC stakers are also eligible for gas refunds when they meet certain trading requirements.\n\nKNC investors include: Hashed, Signum, ParaFi, HyperChain, and Stake Capital.\n\n**3- Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nKNC is the governance and utility token for KyberSwap, a leading DEX and Aggregator in DeFi.\n\nBy supporting KNC on Aave V3 Ethereum, we would give an additional utility to KNC holders by allowing them to borrow stables like GHO against their collateral token. In addition, users could lend or borrow KNC for leverage trading by using Aave protocol.\n\n* KNC is a highly liquid token but is still not on many decentralized lending platforms. Aave can easily be the biggest venue for KNC to be used as a borrow/collateral asset.\n* KNC price feeds are supported by Chainlink on Ethereum, as well as Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum.\n* KNC has over 16,000 token holders on Ethereum, including crypto VCs and other DeFi projects.\n* By supporting deposits of KNC as collateral, users can borrow stablecoins against their KNC to be used in various activities.\n* By supporting KNC as a borrow asset, KNC holders would be able to lend KNC to earn interest instead of selling their tokens. On the other hand, borrowers can borrow KNC for staking and voting on Kyber governance proposals or for liquidity mining.\n* There are a range of yield maximizing strategies and lower carry cost leveraged trading strategies that users could deploy.\n* Kyber team would gain the ability to deposit KNC from the treasury to borrow stablecoins for various activities.\n\nImportant note: More liquidity for KNC on Ethereum can be added if required by the Aave protocol; this can be discussed with the Aave team and community. We are also willing to provide some KNC incentives for Aave users if KNC is supported as a borrow and collateral asset.\n\n**4- Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nKyber was founded by Victor Tran, Loi Luu, and Yaron Velner in 2017, with the first protocol live in February 2018. All 3 founders are well-known researchers in the Ethereum and DeFi community, and Victor and Loi were both Forbes 30 under 30 recipients. Yaron is also the founder of B.Protocol and Risk DAO.\n\nSince inception, KyberSwap has successfully facilitated over $21 billion in transactions and over a million trades for tens of thousands of users, with 60+ DeFi/Dapp integrations.\n\nKyberSwap currently supports 14 chains including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, BNB Chain, ZkSync Era, Linea, Base, Polygon zkEVM, Fantom, Cronos, Aurora, BitTorrent, and Scroll (upcoming).\n\n* Developed one of the earliest DEXes in 2018 with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor.\n* One of the first platforms to aggregate liquidity pools/sources for swaps on Ethereum by integrating different DEXes.\n* Kyber initiated and co-launched Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), the most used wrapped version of BTC in the DeFi space today and a collateral asset on Aave.\n* First to develop and launch amplified pools with high capital efficiency for any token pair (before Uniswap v3), not just stablecoins.\n* In terms of 24H volume, KyberSwap is a Top 3 DEX on Optimism and Linea, Top 4 DEX on Polygon, and Top 5 DEX on Arbitrum, due to its high capital efficiency (High Volume/TVL).\n\nMain Features\n\n* DEX Aggregator: KyberSwap's aggregation algorithm automatically selects the best trade routes and prices from over 70 DEXes, saving time and money for thousands of users and offering superior rates for traders on supported chains.\n* Concentrated/Amplified Liquidity Pools: KyberSwap offers Elastic Pools and Classic Pools for liquidity providers. Elastic Pools have customizable price ranges, anti-sniping features, compounded fees, and concentrated liquidity, leading to better returns. Classic Pools have an amplification factor for improved capital efficiency.\n* KyberAI On-chain Analytics: Based on a proprietary scoring algorithm that uses artificial intelligence and on-chain data, KyberAI is able to help users identify high potential or trending tokens and provide key insights about the price, volume, and on-chain behavior for those tokens.\n* Limit Order: KyberSwap allows users to set Limit Orders for automatic buying/selling of assets at desired prices. Buy limit orders trigger at or below the set price, while sell limit orders trigger at or above it.\n\n**5- How is KNC currently used?**\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and an important part of KyberSwap operations.\n\n* Governance Rights: KNC holders can stake their tokens to become part of KyberDAO, gaining voting power to vote on KIPs (Kyber Improvement Proposals) which help govern KyberSwap and shape its development.\n* Voting Rewards: In return for staking, voting, and participating in governance, KNC holders are able to receive a portion of protocol trading fees generated on KyberSwap. More trades on KyberSwap generate more rewards for KNC holders.\n* Gas Refunds: KNC holders who stake their tokens are also able to enjoy gas refunds when they trade on KyberSwap, with the % of gas refunds dependent on their KNC staking tier.\n* Liquidity Provision: KNC holders can provide liquidity for the token by pairing it with another asset (e.g. KNC-USDC) and depositing the tokens into their preferred KyberSwap liquidity pool. KNC liquidity providers earn fees from the trading activity that goes through the pool.\n* Liquidity Incentives: KNC may be used by KyberDAO as liquidity mining rewards to incentivize liquidity providers on KyberSwap on top of standard trading fees, thereby providing more value to liquidity providers.\n\n**6- Emission schedule**\n\nThere is currently no automatic emission of KNC. All tokens for founders and advisors from the token sale have been distributed since September 2019.\n\n~14.3M KNC is managed by KyberDAO as part of an ecosystem growth fund to facilitate trade and liquidity mining, and other growth activities.\n\nKNC can be upgraded or minted by KyberDAO, subject to a DAO vote by KNC holders.\n\n**7- Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nKNC is an upgradeable token. The overall architecture for KyberDAO is largely based on Aave’s governance model with some differences/modifications such as the ability to enable the creation and voting of multi-option (generic, non-binary) proposals, and enabling the calculation of KyberDAO voting power based on a system that uses the KNC staking model.\n\nKNC is dynamic and can be upgraded or minted by KyberDAO (only via a vote) to better support liquidity and growth.\n\nThe DAO has in-built governance safeguards to ensure that any decision or contract alteration will always be preceded by a suitable time period of preparation and reflection, as well as a minimum voter participation threshold. In addition, we have a 5/9 multisig with the role of a DAO operator that assists with operational tasks and ensuring the integrity of the DAO. The multisig comprises a mix of Kyber team members and founders of external DeFi project representatives.\n\nThe Kyber team alone does not have the power to implement major changes to the KNC token, DAO, and the protocols in the network, without going through a DAO vote.\n\nChanges to KyberDAO and KNC can only be made by the KyberDAO via voting on a Kyber Improvement Proposal (KIP).\n\n**8- Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\n* Circulating market cap (12 September 2023): $90,543,409\n* 24H trading volume (12 September 2023): $10,065,292\n* Etherscan: 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n* Top exchanges are already supporting the latest version of KNC. KNC can be obtained on KyberSwap as well as centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Upbit, Bithumb, Bitrue, Crypto. com, OKX, Huobi, Bitfinex, KuCoin, Kraken, Gemini, MEXC, HitBTC, Gate. io, and Tokocrypto.\n\n\n### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community wait for the feedback from risk management teams (e.g. Gauntlet), we recommend the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nTicker: KNC\n\nContract Address : 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Borrowable|YES|\n|Collateral Enabled|YES|\n|LTV|40%|\n|LT|50%|\n|LB|10%|\n|Debt Ceiling|TBD|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|\n|Supply Cap|TBD|\n|Borrow Cap|TBD|",
