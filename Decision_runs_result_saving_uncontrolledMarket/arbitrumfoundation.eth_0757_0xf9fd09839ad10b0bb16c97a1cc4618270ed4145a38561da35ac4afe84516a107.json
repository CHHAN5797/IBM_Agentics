Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.\n\nOnce the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.\n\n...\n\n## Overall cost\n\n1,500,000 ARB distributed monthly over 6 months, for a total of 9M ARB tokens.",

        "body": "TLDR;\n**The TMC recommends that the DAO votes for #3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy**\n\nThe four possible combined outcomes are:\n- **#1 Deploy Both Strategies**\n- **#2 Only Deploy ARB Strategy**\n- **#3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy**\n- **#4 Deploy Nothing**\n- **Abstain**\n\nIf no ARB is deployed (#4 Deploy Nothing, Abstain win), we will make the necessary modifications and resubmit the proposal for another vote. \n\nThe vote will be conducted via Ranked Choice Voting (RCV): Rank options; results use instant-runoff counting.\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe TMC has divided the partner selection into two groups: one for managing the stablecoin allocation—which covers converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and their ongoing management—and one for managing the ARB allocation for on-chain strategies. \n\nSpecifically, the plan is to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage those on-chain, while the remaining 10M ARB is deployed on on-chain ARB-only strategies.\n\nFurther information on the TMC mandate can be found here: [Tally | Arbitrum | Treasury Management V1.2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/111105159609719390908725919603971316574753860587890014819515615630412225940809?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4)\n\n# Shortlisted Proposals\n**Stablecoin Allocation (15M ARB Equivalent)**\n- Scope: This group covers the full process of converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and managing these assets for DAO liquidity needs.\n\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n- Gauntlet\n\n*Allocation Strategy:* The stablecoin management responsibilities will be evenly split among the three partners with a 33/33/33 distribution, ensuring diversification and balanced risk exposure while meeting the conversion and liquidity objectives.\n\n**ARB Allocation (10M ARB)**\n\n- Scope: This group is focused exclusively on deploying 10M ARB tokens into on-chain strategies designed to generate yield while safeguarding the principal.\n\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n\n*Allocation Strategy:* The on-chain ARB strategy will be managed equally by the two partners using a 50/50 split. Their proposals leverage proven DeFi protocols and ecosystem synergies to maximize risk-adjusted returns while maintaining liquidity and principal protection.\n\n\n# TMC Recommendation\nWe recommend a vote of **YES for the Stablecoin Allocation and NO for the ARB Allocation**.\n\nOur analysis shows that the stablecoin strategies presented by the selected partners meet our criteria for DAO alignment, returns, risk management, etc. \n\nWhereas the current ARB proposals lack sufficient risk management and clear operational details—resulting in low yield projections—we believe it is prudent to sit out on this allocation for now.\n\n\n# Voting Outcomes\nPlease cast your vote on each allocation separately. Your options are as follows:\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with converting 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage them via a 33/33/33 split among Karpatkey, Avantgarde & Myso, and Gauntlet.\n- **No:** Do not execute the stablecoin strategy; retain current ARB holdings without conversion.\n\n**ARB Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with deploying 10M ARB into on-chain strategies, managed in a 50/50 split between Karpatkey and Avantgarde & Myso.\n- **No:** Do not execute the on-chain strategy; hold the ARB tokens.\n\nThe four possible combined outcomes are:\n- **#1 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// YES deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n- **#2 NO, do not deploy the Stable Strategy /// YES, deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n- **#3 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy**\n- **#4 NO, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy**\n\n**We recommend that the DAO votes for #3 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n\nThe vote will be conducted via Ranked Choice Voting (RCV): Rank options; results use instant-runoff counting.\n\n*Note. The first vote corresponds to the Stablecoin Allocation and the second to the ARB Allocation.*\n\n---\n\n# Other Proposals\nDuring our review process, we evaluated several proposals that ultimately did not meet the criteria, required further clarity, or didn’t align with DAO objectives. \n\n- **AnthiasLabs x XBTO:** Their proposal did not provide adequate detail on stablecoin conversion, DAO alignment, or custody arrangements, which are critical to our objectives.\n\n- **August Digital:** While proposing a single-sided AMM strategy for both ARB yield and ARB-to-USD conversion, the proposal provided minimal details. There was no evidence of existing ARB strategies or a dedicated vault, and the timeline for necessary audits—if smart contracts are involved—was not addressed. Moreover, the risk management section appeared generic, with much of the content seemingly repurposed from other contexts.\n\n- **Bracket Labs:** The submission lacked clarity on key operational components, such as the choice of OTC counterparties or DEXes. Additionally, the rationale behind the 2% trading volume figure and the associated price impact considerations were not explained. Although a Stablecoin Vault is reportedly live, the lack of public transparency and reliance on historical yield figures from related funds (rather than the target vault) were significant concerns, compounded by high fee structures.\n\n- **WINR:** The implementation details were insufficient, leading to concerns over the alignment of risk and reward.\n\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit -- Further Clarification on Shortlisted Rationale\n\n**Stablecoin Strategies:**\nProviders like Karpatkey, Avantgarde/MYSO, and Gauntlet stood out due to their provided backtests, clear execution plans, compensation structure, and risk management frameworks.\n\nWe have high confidence in their ability to execute the conversion of 15M ARB into stablecoins with minimal slippage and market impact.\n\nAs well as deploy these assets in well-established, low-risk protocols—aligned with the intended use of funds. The shortlisted proposals target an average yield of 8% to 12% under varying market conditions while primarily holding USDC and USDT.\n\nThis is why we’re recommending a **YES** vote on the stablecoin allocation.\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit V2 \n**Below is a summary of the strategies, including fees and expected returns. Please refer to the tables for full details and note the associated risks outlined below.**\n\nNote that strategies might share the same general risks, and differences in returns may come down to how effectively the providers optimize yield under varying market conditions.\n\nThere are no guarantees or risk-sharing by the providers. As described below, fees are based on the allocation of assets to each provider and/or their performance.\n\nNote that for the Arbitrum Strategy, while both applicants use Myso they have wildly different reported return profiles (hence different risk profiles).\n\n---\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy**\n\n|Stablecoin Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Gauntlet | AAVE V3 | 8% | Free|\n|Karpatkey | Uniswap v3, Camelot v3, Balancer v2/v3, GMX, Aave v3, Compound v3, Fluid, Vertex (Perps), Pendle (Yield) | 12-20% | 0.5% management|\n|AvantGarde/MYSO | AAVE V3, Compound (core),  Pendle, Fluid, and Uni v3 (satellite) | 5-15% | 0.5% / 10% management/performance|\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Strategy**\n\n|Arbitrum Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Karpatkey | Myso | 7-20% | 0.5% mgnt|\n|Avantgarde/MYSO | Myso | 30%+ | 15% perf|\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Key Risks\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\n* **Stablecoin Risk:** The possibility of a stablecoin depegging.\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Exposure to potential hacks of the protocols used by each provider.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Funds may become locked if the lending rate reaches 100%.\n* **Optimization Risk:** The provider’s optimization might not perform as intended or may fail to beat the benchmark.\n* **Custody Risk:** Since the Foundation remains the custodian, custody risk is effectively transferred to the Foundation.\n\n### Arbitrum Strategy\n\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Inherent risk of the protocol being compromised.\n* **Asset Risk:** ARB could lose all value.\n* **Counterparty Risk:** If no counterparty is found, the strategy’s yield could drop to 0%.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Liquidity is locked for the duration of the call (30 days for monthly, 7 days for weekly).\n* **Covered Call Risks:**\n  * **Potential Conversion Risk:** If the strike price is reached, the ARB allocation may convert into stablecoins (see “Managing Potential Conversions”).\n  * **Premium Fluctuations:** Option premiums vary based on ARB’s volatility.\n  * **Secondary Market Risk:** If a covered call isn’t held to expiry, exposure to secondary market prices may result as the matched trading firm buys back the call.\n\n\n---\n\n**ARB Strategies:**\nWhen it comes to the ARB proposals, our review was less encouraging. Although there are some promising elements—for instance, Karpatkey and Avantgarde/MYSO show potential—the ARB strategies did not meet our strict criteria for transparency and risk mitigation. Our internal grading highlighted significant concerns:\n\n* **Lack of Transparency:** Key operational details—such as ARB option liquidity, allocation splits, and execution mechanisms—were either insufficiently detailed or not publicly verifiable, particularly for strategies involving off-chain fund movements.\n* **Inadequate Risk Management:** Given recent security breaches and governance failures across the industry, we believe that preserving the DAO’s capital is a priority. Without a clear risk framework, moving forward with these strategies would introduce unnecessary exposure.\n* **Trade-Offs vs. Returns:** The proposed strategies projected yields between 7% and 30%, depending on the strike price and maturity of options sold, and if the options are sold. If no counterparty is found the options strategy would yield a 0% return. Lending-based strategies offered minimal returns, around 0.16% per year which, even at our maximum allocation, would generate only $10,000–$12,000 annually at current prices. Given the scale of the allocation ($7.5M), these returns do not justify the associated risks.\n\nGiven these trade-offs, we believe the risk is not justified for an allocation of $7.5M worth of assets. Until proposals can deliver fully detailed strategies that meet our risk-adjusted return standards, it’s prudent to vote **NO** for the ARB allocation.\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Alignment Consideration:**\nA key criterion for evaluating submissions was alignment with Arbitrum. While most strategies will be executed on the Arbitrum network, not all will involve Arbitrum native protocols.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this but the main ones are the absence of proposals by Arbitrum native protocols and the fact that most liquidity on Arbitrum is on non-native protocols, making it difficult to allocate a large amount of stablecoin while retaining a competitive yield.\n\nGiven the dearth of sufficient proposals, our recommendation is to do nothing rather than something not justifiable from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n---\n# Edit 06.03.2025 V3\nFurther Clarification on the Shortlisted Rationale\n\n# TMC Clarification on ARB Strategy Decision\n\nHello everyone,\n\nFirst, we want to sincerely thank the teams at @avantgarde, @karpatkey, and Myso for taking the time to discuss their proposals in greater detail with us. We appreciate your proactive approach and the thoughtful contributions you have made, both privately and in the forum.\n\nBelow, we provide additional context on our recommendation to defer active deployment of the ARB allocation at this time, along with feedback on each proposal’s approach and risk management.\n\n# Overall Rationale for the “Hold ARB” Recommendation\n\n### Risk and Transparency\n\nWhile both teams have made significant efforts, the operational details for the ARB strategies, such as liquidity for options, counterparty arrangements, and daily/weekly execution, remain unclear. Given the large ARB allocation, this uncertainty makes us cautious.\n\n### Yield versus Complexity\n\nThe proposed yields for ARB strategies vary widely, ranging from near zero (for example, simple lending) to around 30% (for example, covered calls). However, the higher-yield strategies depend on liquidity or counterparties that may not be scalable, and the lower-yield approaches (for example, 0.16% on Aave) do not justify the additional complexity and risk.\n\n### Asset Manager Selection Considerations\n\nIt’s important to note that selecting an asset manager for alpha generation typically requires a multi-year to decade-long track record across multiple market regimes, a challenging standard, even in traditional finance. Therefore, if the core ARB strategy cannot stand on its own merits, claims of expertise should not serve as the primary selection criteria.\n\n### Prudent Governance\n\nOur mandate is to protect the DAO's treasury. Rather than forcing a strategy with an uncertain risk and reward profile, we prefer to hold ARB until more robust proposals/strategies emerge. This is a postponement rather than a permanent refusal, and we remain open to future improvements.\n\n# Feedback on Karpatkey’s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nWe appreciate Karpatkey’s detailed Risk Management Plan, which includes non-custodial architecture (Safe + Zodiac Roles Modifier), protocol whitelisting (Aave, Compound, Dolomite, Fluid, etc.), and clear maximum exposure thresholds (e.g., no more than 20–25% per protocol).\n\nThe yield estimates of ~8–12% for stablecoins appear realistic, and Karpatkey’s track record in managing other DAO treasuries (Gnosis, ENS, etc.) is well-documented.\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nKarpatkey proposes covered calls (via Myso) and deposit/borrow loops. While these ideas are valid in principle, the TMC remains concerned about the practical scalability of the options component (liquidity, strike selection, and counterparty discovery at large ARB notional sizes).\n\nThe lending-based approach offers minimal yield (~0.16% to ~4%), which does not justify the operational overhead or the added smart contract risk compared to simply holding ARB in a wallet. The covered-call approach is also sensitive to ARB price and carries risk in case of price appreciation as the cost of reimbursing the loan could exceed the value of the stablecoins used for farming. The backtest is based on a period of constant ARB price depreciation and therefore may not fully reflect this risk.\n\nAlthough Karpatkey mentions having advanced monitoring systems to respond promptly to adverse market conditions, we lack sufficient visibility into these tools to confidently recommend this approach to the DAO.\n\n# Feedback on Avantgarde’s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nThe Risk Management section shared by Avantgarde (and MYSO) highlights position-sizing constraints, lockup safeguards, and a diversified stablecoin approach. We especially appreciate the plan’s clarity on monitoring liquidity needs and the ability for the DAO to recall funds if necessary.\n\nExpected returns of 5–15% are in line with typical DeFi yields, and the approach includes established protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap.\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nSimilar to Karpatkey, Avantgarde’s ARB strategy also leans heavily on covered calls (via Myso) for yield generation. Although the theoretical upside is attractive, we lack sufficient real-world liquidity data for large ARB notional amounts. In addition to the conversion risk, the strategy presents a risk in case of a sharp ARB price increase (which again may not be accurately accounted for in backtests done over a period of relatively constant price depreciation). For instance, vaults on Ribbon and Premia also rely on selling covered calls and have recently incurred losses despite both vaults having widely different strategies, following sharp increases in the price of the underlying assets:\n\n![|279x242](upload://s9o3LomjufpoKGFCv2vNkXsIZ7e.png)![|278x242](upload://muAKCFJgbv5cgXo77WVyzhgL7CL.png)\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-ETH-C\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-WBTC-C\n\n![|624x237](upload://sZsXqwOlNY5GCyQH9FPHflXdoVZ.png)\n\nhttps://app.premia.blue/vaults/0xdc631d88dbb5eb39f5c4bf8b4e5298d098912fff\n\nWe value the team’s willingness to iterate on strike selection and maturity dates, but given current market conditions, we do not see a clear, low-risk path to consistent yields above simple “hold” alternatives.\n\n---\n\n# Reminder of Grading Criteria\nOur evaluation of proposals was based on the following key factors:\n- **25% – Experience & Track Record:** Demonstrated ability to manage treasury assets securely and effectively.\n- **25% – Risk Management:** Strength and clarity of risk mitigation measures under diverse market conditions.\n- **15% – Alignment with DAO Goals:** Consistency with the DAO’s growth objectives and ecosystem utility enhancement.\n- **15% – Expected Returns:** Realistic yield projections and sound risk-adjusted performance metrics.\n- **20% – Transparency & Reporting:** Commitment to regular, clear reporting and continuous performance monitoring.\n\n----\n\n# Timelines & Next Steps\n\nWe will move forward with a vote on Snapshot next Thursday, March 6, 2025.\n\n\n**Phase 1 – ARB Conversion & Stablecoin Management (15M ARB)**\n\n**IF Stable Strategy is Deployed*\n- Initiate a three‑month phase to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins.\n- Proceed with the deployment of low‑risk, yield‑bearing strategies for the converted stablecoins, with regular performance and risk reporting.\n\n**IF Stable Strategy is not Deployed:**\nRetain the current ARB holdings without conversion.\nNo further actions will be taken regarding stablecoin management until a new decision is reached.\n\n**Phase 2 – ARB On-Chain Strategy Deployment (10M ARB)**\n\n**IF ARB Strategy is Deployed:**\n- Deploy the 10M ARB into on-chain strategies.\n- Despite going against the TMC recommendation, we will commit to establishing a set of safe parameters for running the strategy.\n\n**IF ARB Strategy is not Deployed:**\n- Hold the ARB tokens without deploying them into on-chain strategies.\n- 3 months post Snapshot the RFP process will be held again.\n\n**Additional Next Steps for Both Allocations**\nThree months after the managers have been elected, publish a comprehensive report detailing the performance and management outcomes and re-evaluate the allocation strategy for potential adjustments.",

This approach can be distilled into three separate phases:\n\n1. Achieving wide-reaching agreement on why the Arbitrum DAO exists and what it is trying to accomplish. In other words, what is the Arbitrum DAO’s mission, vision, and purpose. The MVP is purposefully simple and unambiguous such that it is absolutely clear what the DAO is ultimately working towards, with additional complexity only introduced when strategic goals to reach the end state are created. Without an agreed upon north star, it is impossible to evaluate how one-off strategies and initiatives assist the DAO to reach its goals, simply because there is currently a wide set of different opinions on what the DAO is striving to achieve. Additionally, most—if not all—initiatives and strategies are evaluated in isolation without considering how they play into wider frameworks. While the MVP might feel too abstract, its purpose is to enable more complexity to be stacked on top of it through iterative efforts.\n\n2. Once the DAO’s end state goals have been solidified, anyone will have the opportunity to propose a strategy matrix made up of 12- and 24-month focus areas for the DAO through an open process named Strategic Objective Setting (SOS). These areas should have well-established guidelines for tangible implementation and what they aim to accomplish, as well as only have one purpose—optimally moving the DAO towards its end state. This is the step that will allow the DAO to refocus its attention on the most critical deliverables and judge how one-off initiatives fit into its short- to medium-term priorities. Entropy Advisors is working on the SOS proposal in tandem with the MVP, and it will be posted as a subsequent separate proposal with the DAO choosing one matrix of strategies as the winner.\n\n3. Combined with financial forecasting, the SOS will enable the DAO to budget itself for the next 12/24 months by earmarking capital to each strategic focus area ratified in step 2. Arguably, the most important aspect of this step is for the DAO to align on how profitable/loss-making it wants to be during the coming year(s). Lastly, with clearly defined strategic focus areas, it should also become simpler for the DAO to begin marketing its efforts since, e.g., a clear identity, as well as narratives, can be built around each of the DAO’s focus areas.\n\n![MVP image 1.png](ipfs://bafkreihzcndqv6am5ba2uqx3nnecirushrkktinzlbrqkn46spaxu3767i)\n\nWhen it comes to this proposal, we’ve strived to distill numerous key stakeholders’ and delegates’ thoughts and ideas into a cohesive mission, vision, and purpose for the Arbitrum DAO, presented below. It’ll naturally be impossible to align all DAO participants on the DAO’s end state goals because of the ecosystem’s diversity. However, for this exercise to be successful, the passed Mission, Vision, and Purpose must have buy-in from a clear majority of the DAO and cannot be unilaterally pushed forward.\n\nAfter looking into other ecosystems, we concluded that [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355) currently has the best-suited mechanism to strategically define objectives in a decentralized and efficient manner, which is why we are striving to implement a program for Arbitrum that takes influence from Lido. We thank Lido DAO contributors who set a great example of how decentralized governance should go about this exercise.\n\n## Call to Action\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO’s Guiding Principles are as Follows:\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\n![MVP Image 2.png](ipfs://bafybeieolo4gzttjfxjoa3rv5werhlpfdo36cagyniy7jqzhbcbmcizkci)\n\n\n## Motivation + Rationale\n\nThe current lack of defined mission, vision, purpose, and strategic objectives today has created a notable, twofold inefficiency in the DAO:\n\n1. Each organization operating in the DAO must extrapolate for itself what it should work towards that contributes the most value to Arbitrum. Questions arise such as:\n* Should my organization work toward enabling operational sustainability and painting a picture of ARB as a productive asset?\n* Growth of the technology stack:\n    i. Orbit?\n    ii. Stylus?\n    iii. Arbitrum One?\n* What role should public goods have within Arbitrum?\n\nWith a lack of clear strategic focus areas, being an effective DAO operator becomes difficult. Redundant and conflicting work turn into a reality due to a lack of alignment and organizational structure.\n\n2. The absence of concrete goals has made it challenging for the DAO to judge the effectiveness of initiatives. A system has been created where all the DAO can effectively do is judge “Did this organization work hard” but lacks the ability to judge “Did this organization do a good job moving Arbitrum forward towards its end state goals.”\n\nAdditionally, a clear vision is required for the DAO to pursue its own brand and marketing strategies. It is time to align on this vision. If Arbitrum DAO executes its mission successfully, what does Arbitrum’s place in the world look like? What are the ecosystem and its numerous contributors (the DAO and its programs, the Foundation, and development teams) working towards? What sets Arbitrum apart from competitors?\n\nThe goal of the MVP proposal is to align the DAO on the highest level of purpose, enabling the subsequent SOS to build on top of it and function as a framework through which delegates and key stakeholders can propose and choose a set of concrete short- and mid-term goals for Arbitrum DAO. This approach helps ease Entropy's concerns with our [initial approach](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-dao-s-vision-mission-and-goals/26537), where the proposal promised everything under the sun as it continually expanded with more (and sometimes conflicting) opinions into the mix. Additionally, we believe our original desire to set out on a 5-year plan left too much room for ambiguity without tangible steps to be taken.\n\nThus, the scope has been reduced. Even within the objectively high-level MVP proposal herein, there are still likely to be areas of contention, such as whether Arbitrum should align with Ethereum more closely, whether the DAO should put a greater emphasis on its flagship Arbitrum One product, and whether the delegates will actually feel empowered to use the MVP as a driving force for their actions.\n\nThe MVP will be the foundation for most actions taken by the Arbitrum DAO going forward, especially when it comes to short- to medium-term strategy setting and budgeting. It is a document that will help drive the DAO, protocol, token, and ecosystem into the foreseeable future and directly inform decisions surrounding new proposals and initiatives.\n\n## Diving In\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem. \n\nDriving Question: Why does Arbitrum DAO exist?\n\n* Why is Arbitrum DAO developing all of the products and initiatives with the design decisions it is?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO’s purpose is to **Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem.**\n\nArbitrum is not just scaling tech, it scales L1s without concessions to censorship resistance, accessibility, decentralization, or security. A crucial component of the DAO’s existence is to defend these ideals. For its governed chains, Arbitrum DAO ensures that there is no single point of control, can eliminate rent-seeking intermediaries, and most importantly, users maintain control of their assets without trusting an entity. In order to defend Arbitrum into perpetuity, the DAO requires sustainable operations and funding mechanisms, which will be further expanded on in the Vision section below. \n\nAccording to the [blockchain trilemma](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/vision/), to scale and accommodate more throughput and users, L1s require trade-offs in terms of either security or decentralization. Making concessions to decentralization or security is not an option for Ethereum mainnet, leading to a chain that even with today’s limited number of onchain participants becomes prohibitively expensive for most users. Arbitrum DAO’s purpose, true to Vitalik’s [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), is to scale L1s while defending security and decentralization. \n\nThe second portion of Arbitrum DAO’s purpose is to guide the ecosystem. Guiding the Arbitrum ecosystem refers to every aspect of what Arbitrum offers, whether it be Arbitrum One, Orbit’s ecosystem of chains, or DAO-funded programs. At a high level, guiding encompasses two areas: growing and stewarding. Growing Arbitrum One is achieved by creating the best environment for builders, supporting their apps, bringing in more users and awareness to the value One provides, and ensuring alignment between builders and Arbitrum DAO. The same applies to Arbitrum’s Orbit chains. Sustainable growth is at the core of Arbitrum DAO’s purpose, and the DAO should view its role with respect to growth from a lens of continuing for 100s if not 1000s of years.\n\nStewarding the ecosystem relies on guiding the path forward for Arbitrum upgrades, new products, and funding decisions. In the world of Arbitrum, the DAO is in control, and that means making informed decisions that optimally move the ecosystem forward in an unceasing and durable way. The DAO is in charge of calling the shots for the future of Arbitrum. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\nDriving Question: What is Arbitrum DAO doing to achieve its purpose?\n\n* What activities is it executing in practice that lead to its reason for existence being achieved?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO’s mission is to **Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.**\n\nArbitrum DAO’s mission is to empower people with the sovereignty to build what they want, code in their preferred language, execute without barriers, and create without needing permission—embracing true onchain freedom. However, building one's best onchain world does not just apply to developers, but equally to users, creators, and DAO contributors.\n\nArbitrum gives builders the freedom to develop on their own terms. “Your chain, Your rules.” This includes, among other things, allowing for self-governed rollups (not forcing ARB into the design) and supporting multiple languages. Arbitrum stands out in being the best and most robust scaling tech, but also in forward-thinking design decisions that enable it to be the primary home for builders by giving freedom and flexibility to its development community.\n\nThe most important aspect of enabling the best onchain world is achieved through Arbitrum continuing to build a full-featured tech stack that includes battle-tested permissionless proving, forced inclusion, custom gas tokens, multi-language support, interoperability, MEV solutions, and much more. True to its purpose, the best onchain world with Arbitrum has security at its core.\n\nEmpowering rollup and application developers to leverage the best-in-class technology stack without restrictions will establish network effects and, importantly, a unified narrative that ties together the rest of the ecosystem, creating an environment that attracts new builders across a wide set of verticals to Arbitrum. This in turn enables Arbitrum to be the primary destination for compelling blockspace, defined as a blockchain’s ability to attract users through the utility it provides. For a rollup to be compelling, it must have sought-after blockspace, which can only be achieved in one way: Attracting great apps. We don't just aim to create blockspace that maintains Ethereum's core values, we aim to create blockspace that people want to use. Attracting builders is one of the most crucial pieces to Arbitrum’s mission. While crypto has many amazing apps, compelling blockspace is the key that will enable crypto to break into magnitudes more users in the future. Today, Arbitrum One is the most compelling rollup in crypto and the DAO’s flagship product, and that is an achievement we must continue to support at all costs. That said we must not lose sight that on a long time horizon, the ecosystem will also expand through complimentary Orbit chains.\n\nWhen it comes to end-users, creators, and DAO contributors, Arbitrum DAO’s mission to empower people with freedom can be quantified in two notable ways:\n1. Being part of a wider, resonating collective movement generates a certain degree of loyalty, excitement, and alignment that is difficult to quantify, yet crucial in driving long-term, sustained engagement and new contributions.\n2. Freedom is attributed to the ability to pick and choose from a wide selection of applications and infrastructure-level solutions, creating a package of services tailored to specific requirements. Arbitrum offers flexibility to meet diverse priorities and utility functions—whether users value security, privacy, low costs, etc., the ecosystem adapts to support them all. Arbitrum is building to be the one-stop shop where end users, creators, and DAO contributors are equipped to effortlessly perform anything that’s achievable on a blockchain without constraints.\n\nIn order to reach the aforementioned goals, it is of the utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO runs sustainable operations with revenue. Without sustainability, it will be impossible for the DAO to continue supporting the building out of the best scaling tech, pushing forward an ecosystem attracting the best builders, and providing end users, creators, and DAO contributors with an empowering, collaborative, and personalized environment. A pivotal part of Arbitrum DAO’s mission is ensuring that all highly adopted Arbitrum-based rollups and apps create revenue for the DAO, maintaining alignment between the ecosystem and token.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\nDriving Question: What is the end state goal for Arbitrum that the DAO is striving to achieve?\n\n* Where is Arbitrum’s place in the world after the DAO achieves all it has set out to do?\n\nAnswer: **Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.**\n\nWith the most full-featured tech stack and compelling (sought-after) blockspace in crypto on Arbitrum stack rollups, users and builders from all walks of life and verticals will have flocked into the Arbitrum ecosystem. New users’ first onboarding experience in crypto will be through an Arbitrum rollup, while the default choice for developers will be to deploy on an Arbitrum technology stack-enabled chain. In a world where financial transactions happen onchain, the majority will take place on Arbitrum blockspace.\n\nArbitrum DAO will function as a resilient flywheel. The best tech stack together with robust ecosystem support will increasingly attract builders and notable enterprises who create and enable applications that onboard more users into the ecosystem. Profits accruing to the DAO from users leveraging Arbitrum’s blockspace will bolster network security and also be reinvested in a sustainable and diversified manner. Sequencing and licensing fees will be reinforced by acquiring ownership interests that help expand the ecosystem (intangible) and enable value accrual (tangible). The DAO will function with some similarities to a conglomerate, leveraging investments to create an even more robust application and infrastructure layer, directly strengthening its core product, which again will produce increasing returns that can be used to strengthen network security through ARB and to support new growth.\n\n![MVP Image 3.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeie47gxhymgnzlpwh5p7v24s6fhwlbc3ai3dff7jcbykkadfn2jema)\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nIt took multiple months of conversations with stakeholders to really get a sense of Arbitrum DAO’s future but Entropy Advisors is very happy with the potential for this new process. While much of this proposal is not directly actionable, we believe that it is the necessary first step in moving forward with Arbitrum DAO’s future strategic plans. We look forward to making final modifications to the MVP based on the DAO’s feedback. It is worth noting that it is not possible for the MVP to serve everyone's desires because it would end up with contradictions, but it’s important that it is a document that the DAO can get behind and feel empowered to use.\n\nThe subsequent SOS (Strategic Objective Setting) proposal will be the next step in this exercise, in which anyone will be able to create 12- and 24-month actionable strategic goals for the DAO. The SOS will be posted shortly after the MVP. If approved, it will include a 14-day notice period and 30-day submission window, in which any contributor can submit a strategy matrix of concrete strategic objectives aligned with the MVP. These workstreams could then be budgeted, creating a new paradigm for operational structure in the DAO.\n\n## Expected Timeline\n\n1. Dec 9th: final version of MVP forum period requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions. Will be extended if necessary.\n3. Dec 12th: Snapshot to signal approval/disapproval/abstention of MVP (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n4. Late Dec / Early Jan: SOS posted\n5. Entropy Advisors plans to take the MVP to a constitutional vote, adding it as language to the constitution, after a 6-month trial period. During the initial 6 months, changes can be made to the MVP via a proposal+Snapshot vote, but after being included in the constitution, would require a constitutional onchain amendment. It is our belief that the current MVP is broad enough to handle substantial changes in the crypto market.\n\nA huge thank you to @castlecapital, @maxlomu, and all the other contributors who dedicated considerable time and effort to provide us with valuable feedback on this exercise.",

        "body": "# Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nFollowing the passing of the [Unifying Arbitrum’s Mission, Vision, Purpose (MVP)](https://v1.snapshot.box/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf5fdce242b85134153397754d25a43a49611a3e8a1c73b2e11a67e864c56e022) proposal, we’re moving to the next step in aligning the Arbitrum DAO on its end-state goals and the more granular strategies through which these will be reached. Arbitrum Strategic Objective Setting (SOS) is an initiative through which DAO members will be able to propose and vote on a cohesive set of short- to mid-term objectives in a collective, inclusive, and adaptable way.\n\nThrough the SOS, any contributor can submit a set of short-term (1-year) and mid-term (2-year) objectives and related tangible key results for the DAO. The set of objectives should directly drive the DAO closer to reaching its vision, and align with the mission and purpose, as listed in the MVP proposal. The DAO will then vote on the proposed sets of objectives to select a single collection for implementation.\n\nEvery 12 months, the chosen objective set will be reviewed and, if needed, revised based on changing market conditions, the competitive environment, progress made in the past year, etc. In order to keep the DAO up to date with the progress towards each strategic objective, we suggest the research member of the ARDC be tasked with providing quarterly reports assessing how the DAO has improved through proposals and initiatives as well as suggesting what areas require more attention while recommending solutions to address these areas.\n\nOnce a set of objectives and related key results has been approved, Entropy will strive to build a budgeting framework where each high-level objective is allocated a certain amount of capital on a yearly basis, with interested contributors having the ability to request a share of this capital through a standardized structure. It’s important to note that contributors will still maintain the ability to post standalone proposals outside of this structure and are not forced to tie their initiative to the MVP/SOS/budget framework. Having said that, as the established objectives should be regarded as one of the DAO’s highest priorities, contributors should expect more friction when it comes to passing a proposal that doesn’t reasonably demonstrate that it fits within the established short- to medium-term objectives. In other words, while the freedom to make proposals that fall outside the SOS will not cease to exist, we expect that the DAO will discourage it via the creation of a social contract among delegates.\n\n# Motivation & Rationale\n\nDiversity is undeniably one of Arbitrum DAO’s strengths. We have hundreds of delegates from all around the world with varying perspectives, cultural behaviors, interests, incentives, etc. This is a double-edged sword, however, as it makes it more demanding to converge on unified goals and interim focus areas. The absence of concrete and agreed-upon goals today makes it challenging for the DAO to review progress and facilitate accountability, while it may be unclear to contributors what deliverables they should be prioritizing. Similar to the MVP proposal, the SOS takes inspiration from [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355)’s approach to materializing short- and medium-term objectives for the DAO.\n\nBy establishing clear short- and mid-term strategic objectives and key results, the outcome of the SOS will serve as a roadmap that will bring cohesion and direction to the DAO’s activities. This structured approach will enable the DAO to move beyond reactive governance and toward proactive strategic development. Having well-defined objectives allows the DAO to measure progress better, identify operational gaps, and adjust course when needed.\n\nThese objectives will create a shared foundation for evaluating opportunities across the DAO’s diverse contributor base. When assessing new initiatives or responding to market developments, delegates and contributors will have tangible criteria to inform their choices. This alignment will help prevent the dilution of efforts that can occur in DAOs, ensuring collective resources and energy are directed towards Arbitrum’s most important goals. A regular review cycle ensures the DAO’s objectives remain responsive to changing conditions while maintaining momentum toward the mission, vision, and purpose. If the MVP helps to define the DAO’s long-term vision, then the SOS allows Arbitrum DAO to chart the course to get there.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal can be considered to have two distinct phases. The first phase comprises a ~14-day forum review, feedback, and edit period after which the SOS framework will move to the 7-day offchain voting period. If passed, Entropy will consider the structure of the SOS accepted by the DAO, and the second phase will be initiated. In phase two, contributors will submit their strategic objectives matrices with one matrix finally chosen through a Snapshot vote. The periods making up the second phase are described below.\n\n## Notice Period (14 days)\n\nAt the beginning of the 14-day notice period, announcements will be made on the forum and all the other relevant communication channels (e.g., Twitter, Telegram, etc.), giving delegates and contributors enough time to prepare for the upcoming submission period. This announcement will include:\n\n1. The expected start and end dates of all the subsequent periods (submission, feedback, and revision).\n2. Guidelines on how to submit a proposed set of short- and medium-term objectives as well as related key results.\n3. Link to an open channel through which anyone can submit one-off objectives and related key results for consideration by those looking to develop a full-fledged objectives matrix submission.\n4. Link to an FAQ forum thread where delegates can ask questions about the program.\n\nEntropy Advisors will facilitate the end-to-end process in cooperation with the Arbitrum Foundation and any other relevant parties.\n\n## Submission Period (30 days)\n\nThis submission period lasts 30 days, during which delegates and contributors are invited to make their submissions. Those interested in participating will have to create a forum post under a designated Strategic Objective Setting (SOS) subcategory. The goal-setting methodology utilized will be the Objectives and Key Results framework, where each objective (high-level, inspirational goal) is accompanied by key results (specific, measurable outcomes) that once reached, represent an objective having been completed. As a reminder, these objectives should indisputably align with the DAO’s mission, vision, and purpose. At a minimum, a valid submission must include the following information:\n\n1. View of Arbitrum’s current state and what its strengths/weaknesses are\n2. Short-term objectives (1 year)\n3. Mid-term objectives (2 years)\n5. Key results, i.e., measurable success metrics, for all objectives\n6. Risks connected to all objectives\n7. High-level estimates of non-capital resources needed for each objective\n8. Rationale explaining how the objectives align with Arbitrum’s MVP and why they were chosen given Arbitrum’s current state\n\nThe format for a SOS submission post on the forum is as follows (note, while the Title and headers should follow the below format, the information under each header is up to the author; this is a non-exhaustive list):\n\n* Title\n  * Format: [SOS Submission] {Delegate} – Strategic Objectives\n  * Example: [SOS Submission] Entropy Advisors – Strategic Objectives\n* Summary\n  * A brief summary of the strategic objectives\n  * High-level explanation of their impact on Arbitrum.\n  * Main focus areas for each proposed objective (i.e., Stylus, Orbit, Gaming, etc.)\n* Rationale\n  * A general overview of Arbitrum’s current state, including where the author sees the ecosystem’s strengths and weaknesses.\n  * Explanation of how these objectives are aligned with Arbitrum’s MVP, why they were chosen given Arbitrum’s current state, and what risks, required non-capital resources, and expected outcomes are related to the objectives.\n  * Key assumptions and strategic reasoning behind chosen objectives.\n* 1-Year Strategic Objectives & Key Results\n  * A clear and specific statement of each objective.\n  * ~2-5 measurable key results/success metrics per objective.\n\n* 2-Year Strategic Objectives & Key Results\n  * Same format as 1-year strategic objectives.\n* Further Details\n  * Anything else the author feels as though relevant to include in their submission.\n\n### Condensed Example of a 2-Year Strategic Objective (figures are illustrative):\n\nObjective: Arbitrum becomes the indisputable leader within a selection of onchain finance-related verticals: stablecoins, RWAs, and lending.\n\nAlignment with the MVP: As onchain finance-related verticals continue to grow in usage, importance, and impact, it is imperative for Arbitrum to achieve a market-leading position in a certain set of these sectors. Doing so ensures that the ecosystem stays aligned with its vision of being the home for the universal shift onchain, with Arbitrum rollups as the first stop in crypto for users and the default platform for developers.\n\nKey Result 1: Arbitrum One becomes the second largest blockchain in terms of stablecoin volume traded on onchain exchanges.\n\nKey Result 2: RWAs (excluding stablecoins) held within the Arbitrum ecosystem grow by 20x from when the DAO chooses its set of objectives.\n\nKey Result 3: The Arbitrum ecosystem reaches a 30% market share of all outstanding onchain loans.\n\nWhile the number of strategic objectives in a matrix is not limited, proposers should consider the DAO’s capacity to effectively focus on multiple areas simultaneously. Moreover, while the objectives should be aspirational, they must also be attainable. When providing feedback or choosing a specific objective matrix, we encourage delegates to evaluate their feasibility critically. Implementing unrealistic objectives and key results would most likely result in wasted efforts and be counterproductive.\n\nA given year’s objectives are expected to be limited to a specific focus area and not to overlap with each other. As such, we recommend submitters refrain from proposing objectives that are too high level since the potential for overlap increases. Having said that, the sets of 1- and 2-year objectives can be the same as long as key results across years are different.\n\nSee this example from [Hasu’s proposed goals for Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590). When objectives form a cohesive, well-documented strategy, it is more likely to gain support from delegates. Just giving the DAO a list of objectives likely will not be sufficient; the expectation is for the objectives to make up a holistic strategy with a well-reasoned rationale.\n\n## Feedback period (21 days)\n\nOnce the submission period is over, no new objective matrices can be put forward. The submission period is followed by a 21-day feedback period. During this time, submitters are prohibited from making changes to their submissions to allow delegates to examine each submission, provide feedback, and propose edits. This period ensures that all delegates have ample time to familiarize themselves with each submission and that everyone is commenting on the same submission versions.\n\n## Revision Period (14 days)\n\nDuring the revision period, submitters may amend their objective matrices based on community feedback if they wish to do so. Apart from making edits, this period enables submitters to merge their proposals with others, mixing and matching objectives across submissions (note that a given year’s objectives should still have no overlap). If two or more proposals are merged, proposers should post the final version as a new submission in the SOS subcategory and modify the original submissions’ titles to indicate that they have been merged as well as include a link to the merged version at the top of the original submissions. If a proposer feels as though their objectives and key results are already adequately covered by another submission, they are also free to withdraw their submission during the revision period. At the end of the revision period, submissions will be locked and considered as the final versions, which will be the ones put up for a Snapshot vote to choose the DAO’s strategic objectives matrix.\n\n## Voting period (7 days)\n\nFinally, the voting period. Entropy will be in charge of creating a Snapshot vote with a list containing all finalized strategic objective matrices in a single proposal, with delegates voting on which matrix they are the most aligned with and see as optimal. The Snapshot will utilize single-choice voting with an option to abstain. Quorum is reached when at least 3% of all votable tokens have participated in the Snapshot, with the option that has received the most votes being implemented. A strategic objectives matrix proposer is free to vote on their own submission.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, delegates will vote on standalone matrices formed by sets of 1- and 2-year objectives and key results. Please note that if there is a vast amount of submissions going to a Snapshot vote, Entropy reserves the right to postpone the initiation of the vote following the revision period to ensure that delegates are given some additional time to examine the final versions of submissions. If there is any confusion in navigating the forum throughout this process, e.g., where to post, how to title posts, how to merge proposals with another author/similar proposal, etc., Entropy Advisors will be available to answer any questions from the community.\n\n## Review Phase & Ad Hoc Strategic Objective Adjustments\n\nAfter the initial strategic objectives matrices are defined and one has been chosen, the DAO is encouraged to review the chosen matrix on a yearly basis. This ensures the objectives and their key results remain relevant and aligned with the DAO’s evolving needs and the overall market dynamics. The process is similar to the second phase described earlier, but delegates can propose to modify existing objectives/key results, add new ones, or remove those that are no longer relevant.\n\nA review phase should be initiated 12 months after the previous voting period has ended. Ideally, OpCo has already been operationalized by then, meaning that the DAO can instruct the entity to manage the review phase. As stated earlier, we propose that the research member of the ARDC is initially tasked with providing quarterly reports assessing how the DAO has progressed with respect to its strategic objectives. Once OpCo is operationalized, this responsibility could also be transferred to the entity if the DAO chooses to do so.\n\nThe review phase is initiated by passing a Snapshot vote. In the proposal, the proposer must define who is in charge of managing the review phase. Given the review phase Snapshot vote passes, there will be a 14-day notice period. This will consist of a forum post updating delegates on the current state of the strategic objectives and informing them on what this review phase consists of. Among other things, this forum post should include:\n\n1. A summary of the strategic objectives and how successful the DAO has been with respect to fulfilling them.\n2. The expected start and end dates of all the subsequent periods.\n3. Guidelines on how to submit an amendment.\n4. Link to a FAQ forum thread where delegates can submit questions about the program.\n\nAfter the notice period, delegates are invited to submit amendments to the initially chosen strategic objectives matrix during a 30-day submission period. Amendments are not limited to simply modifying strategic objectives and key results. They can also involve removing, adding, or replacing specific objectives and associated key results.\n\nOnce the submission period ends, amendment submissions go through a 21-day feedback period during which no changes can be made to the submissions. Finally, a 14-day revision period will take place during which proposers can make edits to their proposed matrices and merge them with other proposed matrices before being locked and put up for a Snapshot vote to choose the new objective matrix. If no amendment submissions are made, there is no need to move to the feedback, revision, or voting periods, and the old objectives matrix will remain effective.\n\nNote that the review phase timeline given above can be modified at the discretion of the review phase proposer depending on the number of submissions made.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the SOS review phase should be conducted annually, with each cycle beginning 12 months after the conclusion of the previous voting period. However, if there's a pressing need to review the strategic objectives due to, e.g., changes in the market environment, competitive space, or the DAO’s financials, a delegate can create a forum post outlining extensive reasoning for ad hoc adjustments accompanied by the proposed strategic objectives and related key results. Allowing for at least one week for discussion, the forum post will then be put up for a Snapshot vote utilizing single-choice voting with the options of adopting the proposed objectives and key results, initiating a fast-tracked review phase with a similar structure as described above (again, the proposer has to define who is managing this phase), and leaving the current objectives and key results unchanged.\n\nIt’s important to note that a well-structured strategy objectives matrix **should not be expected to be changed frequently**. As such, a proposed ad hoc adjustment must be extremely rigorously argumented and only take place if most of the previous strategic objectives have been reached or given unprecedented/emergency circumstances. Moreover, delegates ought to be highly critical when such adjustments are proposed. For example, the proposer simply stating that they disagree with the current objectives should not be a strong enough reason to modify the objectives.\n\nIf an objectives matrix is changed on an ad hoc basis, the originally scheduled review phase will be pushed back. This phase should only be initiated once 12 months have elapsed since the previous vote to change the DAO’s strategic objectives and related key results has passed.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO’s strategic objectives and related key results can be removed by creating a forum post explaining the reasoning to do so. Allowing for at least one week for discussion, the post will be moved to a single-choice Snapshot vote with the voting options “For”, “Against”, and “Abstain”, requiring a simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain” for the proposal to pass.\n\nPreviously chosen, not yet achieved objectives and related key results will remain active during a Review/Ad Hoc Strategic Objective Adjustments Phase to ensure the continuity of the DAO's strategic direction, replaced only once a new objectives matrix has been selected through a dedicated voting process. I.e., unless the DAO votes to remove its objectives, the continuity of the SOS is ensured.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* First Phase (Ratification of the SOS Framework):\n  * Review, Feedback, & Edit Period: January 10th - January 23rd\n  * Snapshot Period: January 23rd - January 30th\n* Second Phase (Ratification of a Strategic Objectives Matrix):\n  * Notice Period: 14 days (note that this period's initiation might be pushed back slightly such that submitters will have more time to include possible takeaways from ETHDenver into their matrices during the Submission Period) \n  * Submission Period: 30 days\n  * Feedback Period: 21 days\n  * Revision Period: 14 days\n  * Voting Period: 7 days\n* Review Phase (Potential Amendments to the Strategic Objectives Matrix): Initiated 12 months after the previous voting period has ended or as a result of an ad hoc adjustments proposal as described above.\n\n*Note that any of the time periods in the first and second phases can be shortened/extended at Entropy’s discretion depending on the number of submissions received.*",

        "author": "0xF92F185AbD9E00F56cb11B0b709029633d1E37B4",
        "body": "Synthetix is re-submitting our LTIPP proposal with the support of @coinflip from GMX. (He will post soon, but just sharing here for clarity to all)\n\nWe have reduced our ask to 2m ARB and made other core changes to the Proposal to align with council and delegate feedback.\n\n* Synthetix LTIP Proposal:[ https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023)\n\nWe want to highlight that while our advisors provided valuable guidance, there was a discrepancy between the advisor and LTIP councilor feedback. Had we received the council feedback earlier, we would have promptly made the necessary adjustments to align with the council’s expectations.\n\nBecause of this discrepancy, we feel it is essential for delegates to reconsider the Synthetix LTIP proposal with the following edits:\n\n**Summary of feedback from Councillors/Delegates:**\n\n**1. Grant Size:**\n\n* The requested grant size of 4.5 million ARB is notably large, and it may take a long time for Arbitrum to recoup the benefit.\n* The grant size could potentially crowd out other grants to projects with fewer resources than Synthetix.\n\n**2. Incentive Design and Justification:**\n\n* More details are needed on the proposed trading competition and its contribution to the sybil resistance/wash trading score.\n* The Proposal lacks clarity in justifying the requested grant size and outlining a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategy.\n* The Proposal would benefit from more concrete evidence and data supporting the expected impact on trading activity, liquidity, and user adoption within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n**3. Long-term Alignment with Arbitrum:**\n\n* Given Synthetix’s planned chain as part of the OP Superchain, there is a risk that the Proposal may, in the long term, draw users/liquidity/etc. outside of Arbitrum and be detrimental to the broader Arbitrum market.\n\n**4. Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration:**\n\n* More detail is desired on the proposed candidates for collaboration partnerships with other Arbitrum proposals.\n\n**TLDR Changes**\n\n* Total grant request reduced from 4,500,000 ARB to 2,000,000 ARB\n* Grant breakdown updated:\n  * 1,000,000 ARB for LP incentives (reduced from 1,600,000 ARB)\n  * 900,000 ARB for trading fee rebates (reduced from 1,800,000 ARB)\n  * 100,000 ARB for stablecoin liquidity (reduced from 500,000 ARB)\n  * Removed 600,000 ARB allocation for trading competitions and growth experiments\n* Incentives distribution timeline updated:\n  * LP incentives will be utilized throughout the entire three months, with an initial ramp-up period during the first month, to ensure there is proper liquidity to support open interest once Perps trading scales up.\n  * Stablecoin liquidity incentives & trading/growth incentives will be the focus of the second and third months\n* Milestones updated (scaled down due to reductions in grant sizing):\n  * Week 1-4: Reach 30m in LP collateral\n  * Week 4-8: Reach 5m in stablecoin liquidity\n  * Week 8-16: Achieve 5b in cumulative trading volume\n\n**Detailed Responses to feedback and Changes:**\n\n1. Grant Size and Allocation:\n\n* We have reduced the total grant request from 4.5 million ARB to 2 million ARB to better align with the LTIP Council & Delegate Feedback. This better aligns our proposal with the sizing in LTIP, and will provide valuable incentives to scale up Synthetix on Arbitrum.\n\n2. The revised grant breakdown is as follows:\n\n* 1,000,000 ARB for LP incentives\n* 900,000 ARB for trading fee rebates\n* 100,000 ARB for stablecoin liquidity\n\n2. Justification for Grant Allocation:\n\n**1. 1,000,000 ARB for LP Incentives:**\n\n* This allocation will enable us to achieve a critical mass of LP collateral, supporting the following collateral growth over a 3-month period (excluding trading fee rewards) - We’ve added this information from the request of the CounciCouncil * 20% APY: $27.3 million TVL\n  * 15% APY: $36.4 million TVL\n  * 10% APY: $54.5 million TVL\n  * 5% APY: $109.1 million TVL\n* A critical mass of LP collateral is essential to underwrite Perps Markets. Each $1 of liquidity provider capital allows Synthetix Perps to support $4 of major cryptocurrency open interest or $2 of longer-tail cryptocurrencies. This allocation will enable us to support approximately $70-100 million in OI caps, catering to whale traders and those transitioning from CEXs.\n\n**2. 900,000 ARB for Trading Fee Rebates:**\n\n* Capped at 75% of fees paid for users, this allocation serves two key purposes:\n  * Incentivize users to trade on Synthetix on Arbitrum for the first time, helping to market the product, onboard new traders, and ease them into our ecosystem.\n  * Incentivize LPs backing these markets, as they will receive a majority of the rewards.\n  * Based on the estimated fees rebated at 3-6bp and an ARB price of $1.10, the 900,000 ARB allocated for trading fee rebates translates to approximately $2.7-5.5 billion in fully rebated volume.\n\n**3. 100,000 ARB for sUSD Incentives:**\n\n* sUSD is a core component of our Proposal. Users can deposit LP collateral, delegate it to Perps V3 markets to underwrite trading and earn fees, and mint sUSD to pre-borrow against their trading fees. Ensuring deep liquidity for sUSD is critical to support this functionality and enhance capital efficiency.\n* At 10% APY, the 100,000 ARB allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $6 million.\n* At 15% APY, the allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $4 million.\n* At 20% APY, the allocation can support a liquidity pool size of approximately $3 million.\n\n3. Long-term Alignment with Arbitrum:\n\n* We understand the concerns regarding the potential impact of our planned OP Superchain on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Before anything else, we’d like to clarify that we see Arbitrum as a critical path of growth for Synthetix, and DeFi Derivatives as a whole. It has been the home of almost all onchain DEX Perps protocols, and we are excited to offer traders and LPs Synthetix V3 as another trading option. Additionally, we propose the following:\n* We will prioritize the growth and development of Synthetix on Arbitrum, focusing on driving users, liquidity, and activity to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n  * It is also critical to note that the Synthetix deployment on Arbitrum is exclusive in its usage of an Arbitrum native stablecoin to increase system capital efficiency, support for additional assets outside of USDC (like Ethena sUSDe/USDe), and existing integrators ready to support this deployment.\n* We will work closely with the Arbitrum community and other projects to foster collaborations and integrations that benefit the entire ecosystem. There are ample opportunities for existing players, and due to the composable nature of Synthetix V3, we are excited to utilize these to increase the usage of Synthetix for Arbitrum native users.\n  * We’ve already passed a proposal with Ethena to support their stablecoin as collateral, and intend to onboard many more Arbitrum native assets as collateral types.\n* Clarify that Synthetix does not intend to bridge users to another chain through this program. We see a critical pathway to grow on Arbitrum as a home for DeFi Perps, and we intend to grow alongside the chain to grow onchain DEX Perps on Arbitrum.\n\n4. Collaboration and Ecosystem Integration:\n\n* We have identified several potential candidates for integration/asset support partnerships with projects on Arbitrum. These including existing ecosystem partners - Kwenta, Polynomial, Rage Trade, Infinex, and more.\n  * Additionally, at the asset level, Synthetix V3 can support any collateral type with an onchain oracle. Governance has already approved sUSDe/USDe as collateral on the platform and DAI/USDC/ETH/ARB.\n  * In the future, we intend to support yield-generating collateral types to increase the amount of composability, this will include (subject to governance) Lending Tokens (aave, comp, etc), sDAI from MakerDAO, LRT’s, LST’s, BTC on Arbitrum, and so on. We’ve listed this on our Proposal as well.\n\n5. Removed from the Proposal\n  * Trading Competitions/Growth Experiments - We’ve removed these from the Proposal due to council feedback.",
