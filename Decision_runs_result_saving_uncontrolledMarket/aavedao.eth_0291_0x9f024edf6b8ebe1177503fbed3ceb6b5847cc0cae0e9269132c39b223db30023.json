        "body": "---\n**Title:** [ARFC] Stablecoin Harmonization and Asset Parameters Optimization \n**Author:** @ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n**Date:** 2024-01-03\n\n---\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes focusing stablecoin collateral usage on USDT and USDC while setting LTV to zero for less-trafficked stablecoins and long-tail assets. The objective is to minimize risk for the protocol, optimize revenue generation, and align with market demand trends.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave's revenue primarily comes from wETH borrowing and stablecoins borrowing. Years of User behavior data in DeFi indicates a low demand for fluctuating assets as collateral except in use-case-specific scenarios (LST/LRT loops for Weth, RPL borrow to deploy mini pools). Based on @ChaosLabs  [data](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Ethereum/listed-assets/), only 2.4%, 3.7%, and 5.8% of supplied DAI, USDT, and USDC on Ethereum are being utilized as collateral. We can also note that market demand for alternative stablecoins is less sensitive to borrow rates compared to blue-chip stablecoins like USDT and USDC.\n\n\nThe DAO governance has been lenient in onboarding some collaterals, such as KNC, which currently attracts nearly zero traction (currently used to generate 0.79$ of borrow volume) and generates minimal revenue. Additionally, the asymmetric risk presented by stablecoins, such as during the CRV event (collateral was USDC with very high LT and low LB), highlights the need for optimization considering Risk/reward.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Adjustments:\n\nThe ACI proposes the following strategy shift:\n\n1. Focus on USDT and USDC as primary stablecoin collaterals.\n2. Set LTV to zero for alternative stablecoins and long tail assets.\n3. Enable a 3%/week LT reduction for these stablecoins assets, providing ample time for users to react and keep them as passive yield sources or borrowable assets that represent 99% of current user demand and most of protocol revenue.\n4. Propose the following adjusted standardized ReserveFactor categories for Aave assets:\n\n| Collateral Type | Reserve Factor % |\n| --- | --- |\n| wETH | 15% |\n| USDC/USDT | 10% |\n| Alternative stablecoins & long tail assets | 20% |\n| DAI | 25% |\n\n5. Fade out as collateral the following stablecoins: \n\n- FRAX\n- LUSD\n- EURS\n- agEUR\n- JEUR\n- MAI\n\n6. freeze (if not already), then slowly offboard the following alternative stablecoins and long-tail assets that failed to gain traction by gradually increasing RF to 99.9%, decreasing LT by 3% per week then applying incremental interestRateStrategies incentivizing users to switch to others collaterals or borrowed asset as the DAO implemented for BUSD and TUSD on Aave V2:\n\n| Collateral Type          | Network      |\n| ----------------------- | ------------ |\n| EURS                    | All pools     |\n| agEUR                   | All pools     |\n| JEUR                    | All pools     |\n| MAI                      | All pools    |\n| KNC                     | Ethereum     |\n| STG                     | Ethereum     |\n| BAL                     | All pools    |\n| FXS                     | Ethereum     |\n| UNI                     | Ethereum     |\n| WBTC.e                  | Avalanche      |\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Community feedback and gather consensus on the proposed adjustments.\n2. Proceed to ARFC snapshot stage for formal community sentiment check.\n3. If successful, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the **frozen** V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. \n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. \n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n- “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |\n| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |\n| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |\n| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |\n- “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |\n| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |\n| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to:\n\n(1) Reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for sixteen (16) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n(2) Increase Reserve Factors for all collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reducing the potential risks associated with V2 markets and promoting migration to V3, we suggest a phased wind-down of the **frozen** V2 markets. The following proposal is part of a series of proposals to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets.\n\nThe previous iteration of proposals:\n\n- [[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.6.23](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-6-23/13789)\n- [[ARFC] Chaos Labs - Incremental Reserve Factor Updates - Aave V2 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766)\n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction.\n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) - This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations.\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% and the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n• “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 35% | 1,580 | 5 |\n| BAT | 52% | 38% | 750 | 3 |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 250 | 3 |\n| DPI | 42% | 22% | 80 | 2 |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 500 | 4 |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 1,500 | 4 |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 1,160 | 3 |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 2,440 | 10 |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 56 | 1 |\n| UNI | 77% | 57% | 500 | 9 |\n| SNX | 59% | 39% | 650 | 10 |\n| MKR | 64% | 44% | 140 | 5 |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 45 | 2 |\n\n• “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 45% | 1,120 | 3 |\n| BAT | 52% | 42% | 80 | 2 |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 250 | 3 |\n| DPI | 42% | 32% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 500 | 4 |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 1,500 | 4 |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 1,160 | 3 |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 2,440 | 10 |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 56 | 1 |\n| UNI | 77% | 67% | 290 | 6 |\n| SNX | 59% | 49% | 85 | 3 |\n| MKR | 64% | 54% | 16 | 2 |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 45 | 2 |\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Aggressive | $10,100 | 58 |\n| Moderate | $8,580 | 43 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### LTV Decrease\n\nFor assets where the LTV is not 0, we recommend maintaining the same buffer as the current configuration.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nIn line with our [V2 to V3 migration plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636), we propose another iteration of RF increases on Aave V2 Ethereum. By progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on V2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to V3. In this proposal, we suggest an increase of  5% for all V2 collateral assets.\n\n## Specification\n\nFrozen Assets:\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV* | Current RF | Rec RF |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 35% / 45% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| BAT | 52% | 38% / 42% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| DPI | 42% | 22% / 32% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 0 | 0 | 45% | 50% |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 | 45% | 50% |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 70% | 65% | 25% | 30% |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 40% | 30% | 25% | 30% |\n| UNI | 77% | 57% / 67% | 65% | 45% / 55% | 25% | 30% |\n| SNX | 59% | 39% / 49% | 46% | 26% / 36% | 40% | 45% |\n| MKR | 64% | 44% / 55% | 59% | 39% / 49% | 25% | 30% |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 47% | 40% | 25% | 30% |\n- Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options.\n\nUnfrozen Assets\n\n| Asset | Current RF | Recommended RF |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DAI | 15% | No Change - will be addressed in a separate proposal  |\n| FRAX | 25% | 30% |\n| GUSD | 15% | 20% |\n| LUSD | 15% | 20% |\n| sUSD | 25% | 30% |\n| TUSD | 25% | 30% |\n| USDC | 15% | 20% |\n| USDP | 15% | 20% |\n| USDT | 15% | 20% |\n| CRV | 25% | 30% |\n| WBTC | 25% | 30% |\n| ETH | 20% | 25% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum. \n\nGiven the current conditions and protocol usage, we propose 2 options for the community to vote on:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-CRV-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-7-10-32dc4ed994be4029b05af831ce5ea537).\n2. “Moderate” - 3% reduction. This option is aligned with the previous reduction and the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nIn the table below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. \n\n| Option | Liquidation Threshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Moderate | 52 | 3 | $46 |\n| Aggressive | 49 | 5 | $116 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 55 | 52 / 49 | -3% / -6% |\n| CRV | LTV | 49 | 46 / 43 | -3% / -6% |\n\n*Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the “aggressive” and “moderate” options*\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "---\n**Title:** [ARFC] Chaos Labs - Update WETH IR on V3 Arbitrum and Optimism - 02.16.2024 \n**Author:** Chaos Labs\n**Date:** 2024-02-16\n\n---\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nDecrease slope1 on Arbitrum and Optimism from 3.3% to 3%.\n\n### Motivation\n\nOver the last eight months, we have observed a drop-off in WETH interest rates on Ethereum and, thus, relative demand for ETH borrowing.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreic3lclpvo7ac5253ucpeejalt42j6h3cdjnrd6vaefdlr62nht23e)\n    \n*Time series of WETH borrow APY on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism, in addition to stETH APY.*\n\n\nNote that the red dotted line indicates the point when the base_fee decreased from 1% to 0% on Arbitrum and Optimism. This phenomenon can be explained by the drop-off in ETH staking yield, as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies. Additionally, given Aave prices stETH:ETH 1:1 with the underlying exchange rate, minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements.\n\n**Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY**\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidezrni5upml4xk4kzuchihyd4magrivgd5dvkpicynhrl6atenjy)\n    \n*Correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY.*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihrjropidawamiki4v4bchp6lgb4fwp2rhvodamveeec4vcqwpgoy)\n    \n*Cross-correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*\n\nComputing the cross-correlation between the three markets, we notice an approximately 1-week lag when this hits the maximum value, implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY.\n\nThis is statistically significant, as we can see below, where 85%-90% of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain.\n\n**Arbitrum**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia4qecvzmgfvjxdoicw3vl2hwd5fvddg72pckqd6dvcdhljvqowia)\n    \n\n**Optimism**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibvtx2mcru2gie5oaek3pqcj2bxohv5zxw4f4pv3jjgcliz7yicxe)\n    \n\n**Ethereum**\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihjoo5senhh2qa747ap4ly2sfhva2zby5ex3lvmeffumryilyfp3y)\n    \n### stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY\n\nInterestingly enough, one might think that as stETH yields decrease, looping strategies would become less profitable. However, upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY (stETH APY - WETH APY) alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t, a negative correlation emerges, with the peak occurring at a 2-week lag. Essentially, this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY. Thus, we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high, borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible, leading to convergence at lower yields. On the contrary, when stETH APYs are low, borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping, perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable, leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high. This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low.\n\n**stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeie4ng55vhthsijbs6l676atj6rjpbatve7w2tufcl3mkccqukocqu)\n    \n*Time series of stETH APY - WETH APY. stETH APY plotted on secondary axis.*\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihq7kfchngvinlhhneqnuqu4aamzfasf3d5e6gxddnh4rh5zkxbj4)\n    \n*Cross-correlation between (stETH - WETH borrow APY) and stETH APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*\n\n**WETH Utilization Rates**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihjpcivhoywbhley2ysf4zaaa7nqmkqtsx7f3rt33dvphemir6w4u)\n    \n*WETH Utilization rate time series.*\n\nBased on the observed trend, it's evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues. While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization, it remains suboptimal. Thus, we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease, which returned 0.6%, to derive the decrease in slope1. Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 0.6% variance, any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility. In such a scenario, it would be prudent to revert slope1. However, given the current trend and staking APY, this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO.\n\nAssuming convergence at today’s WETH interest rates:\n\n|  | Arbitrum | Optimism |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Old Utilization Rate | 68.69% | 65% |\n| New Utilization Rate | 76.5% | 72% |\n| Projected Revenue Increase | 13.62 ETH $38.5k year | 4 ETH $11.3k year |\n\nWe note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other non-Ethereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant, as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral, there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months.\n\n###  Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset |Parameter | Currebt |Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | ---| ---|\n| Arbitrum | WETH |Slope1| 3.3% | 3% |\n| Optimism | WETH|Slope1|3.3% | 3% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
