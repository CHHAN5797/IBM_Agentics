        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-26\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\nThis proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nArtemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 30.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Website](https://artemisfinance.io)\n\n[X](https://x.com/Artemisfinance)\n\nDocuments:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/)\n\nAudit Report:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit)\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. \n\nTo enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).\n\nCurrently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. \n\nOther liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. \n\nThe liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\nIntegrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.\n\nConfidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\n [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.\n\nIntegration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.\n\n### Specification\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Audits & Relevant links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n Issuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nWhitepaper: CDCETH\nDeFillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: https://crypto.com/staking\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\n\nCommunity:\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/cryptocom\nTelegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nNews on Telegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nDiscord: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.

If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.

As productive assets, staking tokens are high quality collateral to borrow against.\n\nGiven their high correlation to ETH, LRTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nThe onboarding of ezETH will consequently create increased ezETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of ezETH.\n\n## **Chain to be deployed/listed**\n\nEthereum mainnet.\n\n## **Relevant KPI & Points Rewards**\n\nRenzo awards ezPoints and EigenLayer Restaked Points based on users’ ezETH holdings. Every user that deposits ezETH as collateral in Aave will also be awarded ezPoints and EigenLayer points 1:1.\n\nAs relevant KPI for the Protocol:\n\n- Total Value Locked: $1.9 billion\n\n- Total supply: 526K+ Renzo Restaked ETH\n\n- 24H trading volume: $80,203,780\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[Renzo Protocol](https://www.renzoprotocol.com/)\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.renzoprotocol.com/docs)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol)\n\n[Audits](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol/contracts-public/blob/master/Audit/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment.pdf)\n\n[Chainlink Data Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ezeth-eth)\n\n[Composable Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Renzo Protocol for creating this proposal.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard osGNO to Aave v3 Gnosis\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-29\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to Onboard osGNO, the Liquid Staking Token (LST) of StakeWise V3 into the GnosisMarket. By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nGNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain. \n\nosGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.\n\nCreating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.  \n\nosGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism). If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.\n\nosETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nPotential POL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nosGNO announcement post: https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\n\nosGNO Vaults: https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeWise and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and some ACI team members are holders of GNO.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "## [ARFC]  Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum\n\n## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-08-12\n---\n\n> ARFC has been updated with Risk Parameters provided by both Risk Service Providers after having reservations with exchange rate oracles. 2024-08-12\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 800 Mn+ (~270k Eth) TVL\n- 20K+ restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH, sfrxETH, and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\n*> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-08-09 and ARFC has been updated.* It is recommended listing rsETH using an exchange rate oracle. \n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 19,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,900 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-Correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9.83% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn\n    - Few others\n- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)\n\n**Oracles**:\n\nrsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:\n\nChainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6\n\nChainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nRedstone market feed:\n\n[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nrsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.\n\nAccepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.\n\nExchange rate calculation -\n\nA → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain\n\nB → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]\n\nC → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]\n\nD → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]\n\nE → Total supply of rsETH\n\nExchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nPrior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. \n\nNevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n* [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n* Contract Address:[ 0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n* [GitHub Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
