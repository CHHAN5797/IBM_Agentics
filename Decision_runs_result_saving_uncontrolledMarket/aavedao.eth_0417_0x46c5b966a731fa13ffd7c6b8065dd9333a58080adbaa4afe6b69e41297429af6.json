        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Tooling Upgrade\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza\ncreated: 2023-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThe publication suggests that the Aave DAO contracts @TokenLogic to develop various smart contracts aimed at assisting in the management of the DAO's Treasury.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAt present, the Aave DAO has a mechanism for bridging funds between Polygon and Ethereum using the [Aave Polygon-Mainnet ERC20Bridge](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers/tree/master/src/bridges) via the shortExecutor. This contract was created by @efecarranza during their tenure at [Llama](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-aave-swapper-and-strategic-asset-manager-contracts/14522/3).\n\nTo ensure the Aave DAO's financial stability and the ability to transfer assets across different networks through the shortExecutor, it is crucial to establish equivalent contracts for other networks. One such scenario involves moving USDC from Avalanche to Ethereum, effectively extending the DAO's stable coin runway.\n\nThis publication recommends the development of the following tooling contracts:\n\n1) Avalanche to Ethereum\n2) Optimism to Ethereum\n3) Arbitrum to Ethereum\n\nUpon the creation of these contracts, they will become public goods within the Aave ecosystem. This means that anyone will have the capability to draft a payload for transferring the DAO's funds between various networks with minimal effort.\n\nOnce the Avalanche to Ethereum bridge contract is completed, TokenLogic intends to propose a fund migration to the Ethereum Treasury to support the ongoing financial stability of the DAO.\n\n# Specification\n\nTokenLogic is to create the following contracts:\n\n1) Avalanche Bridge to Ethereum\n2) Arbitrum Bridge to Ethereum\n3) Optimism Bridge to Ethereum\n4) Transfer Funds Avalanche to Ethereum\n\n@BGDLabs is to review and approve these contracts.\n\n# Funding\n\nTo facilitate the development and implementation of the previously mentioned contracts, this publication seeks the following funding:\n\n**Funding Amount:** $12,430.00, to be paid in GHO.\n**Delivery Schedule:** The estimated timeframe for completion is approximately 5 weeks, which includes the review by @BGDLabs (an estimated 2 weeks).\n\nThe deliverables will undergo approval by @bgdlabs to ensure their completeness. The Avalanche bridge contract will play a pivotal role in moving funds from Avalanche to Ethereum, thereby providing support for the DAO's financial stability.\n\nThe transfer of funds as per the approved amount will occur upon the successful delivery of the contracts. The Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:\n\n1) YAE\n2) NAE\n3) ABSTAIN\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.\n\nThe DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Funding Update\nauthor: \n@TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @scottincrypto \n@r3genFinance - @Elliott_r3gen, @Pepperoni_Jo3_r3gen\ncreated: 2023-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Introducing \"Curator\" by Llama\nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon and Fermin\ncreated: 2023-07-11\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces the `Curator` by Llama.\n\nThe `Curator` is a dedicated contract for managing the exchange of assets with MEV and price-impact protection, where possible.\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the Curator:\n\n* Swap Assets\n* Acquire LSTs\n* Transfer Assets\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe DAO is required to exchange assets. This could be to reduce the DAOs exposure to long tail assets or to increase stable coin holdings to facilitate payment to various service providers. It is not possible to perform swaps directly from the Collector / Treasury Contract. After much discussion, @llamaxyz and @bgdlabs have concluded that it is not viable to upgrade the Collector Contract to facilitate the efficient management of the DAO's assets. As a result, a series of separate contracts are required. \n\nA part of this solution is the `Curator`. The `Curator` receives assets from the Collector / Treasury Contract, swaps (or deposits) assets and sends the newly received asset to another address. The `Curator` is intended for solely exchanging assets and not holding assets. \n\nThe first iteration of the `Curator` is to be deployed on Ethereum and then later introduced to other networks. On Ethereum, the `Curator` is to interact with CoW Swap, Lido Protocol, and Rocket Pool contracts. \n\nTo limit the surface area of the contract, an `AllowList` will define which contracts the `Curator`can be interacted with. The `ShortExecutor` must first add each contract address to the `AllowList`. \n\nIt is possible to assign the `curatorRole()` to a specified wallet address, Treasury Manager. The `curatorRole` can then only interact with contract on the `AllowList` set by governance. The `AllowList` eliminates the risk of the `Curator` interacting with a malicious contract or running away with the DAO's funds. The intent is to implement the highest heirarchy of control.\n\nFor future deployments of the `Curator` on other networks, the aggregator protocol used to swap assets with MEV protection does so over a lengthy time horizon. This prevents any further steps performed by the same AIP submission. In these instances the `curatorRole` offers more flexibility and reduces the AIP overhead.\n\nEach Curator deployment will contain different functionality tailored to that network and Aave DAO's needs. As a result, each deployment will be presented to Aave DAO as an [ARFC] proposal for the community to discuss and vote on. \n\nDuring the intial deployment on Ethereum, @Llamaxyz advocates for using the `ShortExecutor` to perform all the necessary transactions. The `curatorRole` can be assigned at a later date. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe Ethereum Curator will provide the following functionality to Aave Protocol: \n\n1. Receive assets from the Treasury (assets must be pushed)\n2. Redeem aTokens for underlying spanning Aave v1, v2, and v3\n3. Swap assets via CoW Swap with MEV protection and using Milkman\n4. No reentrant \n5. Cancel trade\n6. Rescue tokens\n7. allowTokens(address[] tokens) onlyExecutorOrAllowedCaller\n8. Deposit ETH into Lido Finance Protocol to receive stETH\n9. Wrap stETH to create wstETH\n10. Deposit ETH into Rocket Pool's contract to receive rETH\n11. Transfer assets to Treasury\n12. Call a function to deposit assets in Aave v3 on behalf of Treasury\n13. Allow-list tokens/contracts that can be interacted with\n14. Allow-list Executor and approved multisig, CuratorRole().\n\nThe Curator will contain an `AllowList` defining which contracts the contract can interact with. The `AllowList` can only be updated by Aave Governance via the `ShortExecutor`. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance.\n\nThe [ARFC] publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].\n\n# Disclosure\n\n@llamaxyz is a service provider to Aave DAO. Llama is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is compensated by only Aave DAO for creating this ARFC.

However, it’s common to still see projects overpaying so it might take more time for the full market to understand these changes.\n\nFor more context, some veBAL holders voted for the GHO gauges over the past two months without receiving bribes, enabling to generate ~ $300k of incentives on GHO gauges.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to propose several options to update the Balancer ecosystem holdings of the DAO by acquiring AURA to increase its maximum emission power.\n\n*Current data (September 30th)*\nAURA price: 0,84$\nveBAL/vlAURA ratio: 0,1598\nveBAL value acquired per 1$ of vlAURA bought: 1,88$.\n\n## Initial Est. veBAL position\n\nAave DAO acquisition of 157K B-80BAL_20WETH was executed on this proposal 2. If the full amount was locked, the weekly emissions value would be ~ $7,7K per week.\n\n## Current DAO holdings\n\nShortly after this proposal 4 was submitted, TokenLogic submitted two proposals: a first time sensitive one to acquire 443k AURA OTC from Olympus DAO with DAI 1, executed on this AIP, and another to sell the corresponding value in BPT for GHO 2, approved on the following TEMP CHECK.\n\nThe table below shows the Olympus OTC deal data & impact on Aave treasury once executed using current GHO & BPT prices.\n\nIf the DAO was to lock its remaining BPT & AURA holdings now, the weekly emissions value generated would be ~ $10,8K / week.\n\n## Improvement scenarios\n\nWhile an increase can be observed (7,7k to10,8k/week), the maximum emissions can still be improved, either by optimizing or increasing and diversifying the exposure. The tables below show an emission power overview post AIP-42 for both cases.\n\nThe current situation would also require to vote on both layers, which complexifies the management, however this option will be possible as Llama’s SAM contract upgrade ARFC to support both veBAL & vlAURA, and propose to grant the asset manager role to the committee will be published in the coming days (code currently in review by BGD).\n\nAs described in both options above, the goal of this ARFC is to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA units, either with BPT or with stables. The Option 3 proposed in the comments aims to find a compromise for all stakeholders by acquiring ~ 950K AURA units and staking BPT holdings.\n\n### 1) Convert to remaining BPT to AURA\n\nThis option considers optimizing the current holding by selling the remaining BPT for AURA, which will improve the gauge power owned without spending more funds to increase the exposure value.\n\nDespite proposing to convert BPT, Balancer remains a strategic partner and this acquisition will actually enable the DAO to grow more liquidity on Balancer, and partially support the SM strategy once live, creating an important amount of bribes for veBAL holders.\n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA, the weekly emissions value would currently be ~ $20,1K / week (almost twice the current situation including votes on both layers).\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Maximal emission power (Full vlAURA)\n- No extra investment (BPT conversion)\n- Simple management (Vote on one layer only)\n- Less locking restrictions (No decay & 4 months lock)\n- Will enable to grow more liqudity on Balancer\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Sell BPT acquired to lock veBAL according to the partnership (limited price impact)\n- Can be considered as unfair for veBAL holders who supported GHO at launch\n- Balancer DAO might sell the AAVE acquired during the TokenSwap\n\n### 2) Keep remaining BPT & acquire AURA to lock both\n\nAfter receiving some feedback including concerns about selling BPT (initially acquired before AIP-42 at the Balancer partnership to lock for veBAL), this option considers to retain the BPT for veBAL and acquire additional ~ 1,3M AURA to lock for vlAURA with stables from the treasury which increases both the emission power & the exposure value.\n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA with stables and lock the remaining BPT holdings, the weekly emissions value generated would be ~ $25,7K / week.\n\nWhile this improves weekly emissions by $5,6K, this strategy is less efficient compared to the above as it would complexify the management with the need to vote on both layers (one on-chain, one off-chain), relock the veBAL holdings, manage the two voting periods (weeks/rounds), and cost an extra $1M in stables from the DAO treasury.\n\n#### Pros:\n- Increased overall emission power of the Aave DAO (veBAL + vlAURA)\n- Favor good relations with Balancer by following the initial partnership proposal.\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- $1M extra investment (AURA acquisition with stables)\n- More complex management (Vote on two different layers)\n- Includes veBAL restrictions (Voting power decay & up to 1 year lock)\n- Emission power not fully optimized\n\n*(Despite its maximal estimated efficiency, there isn’t an option to convert both BPT holdings + $1M for AURA as this amount would be complex to acquire with the current liquidity available)*\n\n### 3) Mint auraBAL & use BAL, use USDC/AAVE rewards for bribes & lock AURA rewards + Acquire $800K of AURA\n\nThis was initially suggested by Karpatkey in the comments, and updated to this revised option which aims to find a good compromise for all stakeholders.  \n\nThe major update is the consideration of the classic auraBAL staking to allocate BPT instead of converting it to AURA. This strategy earns 18% APR in BAL + AUR, which can be used to create bribes & compensate for the reduced acquisition. \n\nAURA can be accumulated to be locked for vlAURA, and the amount can be replaced with USDC/AAVE to maintain the rewards value which will be used for bribes with the BAL. \n\nThis also reduces the AURA market buy from $1M stables (in Option 1 & 2) to 800K$ in the Option 3: \n- $400K on market (400K USDC) \n- $200K token swap with the Aura DAO (2950 AAVE)\n- $200K OTC Deal with AEF & Contributors (200K USDC)\n\n* Emission power with vlAURA to be acquired: \n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 950K AURA as described above, in addition to 440K acquired from Olympus, the weekly emissions value would be ~ $16,2K / week.\n\n* Emission power with auraBAL staking rewards used for bribes: \n\nIf the DAO was to stake all the auraBAL minted with BPT in the classic staking, the weekly rewards would be ~ $5,4K / week. Assuming a weekly vlAURA bribe cost of $0,007 / week,  ~ $8,9K / week can be obtained in emissions. \n\nOption 3 Total weekly emissions: $16,2K + $8,9K =  $25,2K / week\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Mint & stake auraBAL instead of selling BPTs\n- Very good emission power (vlAURA votes & bribes)\n- Simple management (Vote & bribe on one layer only)\n- Less locking restrictions (No veBAL decay & 4 months lock)\n- Reduce AURA amount to acquire on market ($400K vs $1,1M)\n- AURA long term accumulation (rewards replaced for bribes)\n- Increase veBAL/vlAURA ratio\n- 1,4M vlAURA locked & 157k BPT staked ( good for Aura)\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Complexify the strategy implementation (where to stake auraBAL to be defined)\n- Complexify rewards management (AURA to be lock, BAL + equiv USDC for bribes)\n- Requires a $800K extra investment (including $200K in AAVE & $600K in USDC)\n- Low liquidity & trading volume on auraBAL\n\nIn terms of emission value, the revised Option 3 proposed is similar to Option 2, which was the highest amount proposed ($25,7K vs $25,2K weekly).\n\n# Acquisition details\n\nRegardless of which option above is voted on the ARFC, the proposal is to acquire AURA with USDC on market to reduce the price impact. If anyone reading this is interested in selling AURA OTC, feel free to comment.\n\nSome Aura contributors & the Aura Ecosystem Fund Committee proposed a 200k AURA OTC deal for USDC (available on September 29th), using a TWAP price from the ARFC forum (posted on September 26th with Snapshot vote starting on September 29th) until snapshot vote ended if approved (October 4th).\n\nOverview of the AEF deal using the current AURA price to facilitate estimations but may vary depending on the TWAP price:\n\nThe optimal way to execute these market transactions seems to be using the TWAP orders from Cowswap to split the trades into several orders.\n\nWhile the price impact of selling the remaining BPT for USDC in one transaction is limited (3,5%), this can be reduced to 2,2% with a split of 5 orders. For AURA, the price impact if acquired in one transaction is quite important (42%), but this can also be reduced to 5,7% with a split of 10 orders.\n\n# Specifications\n\nOTC acquisition: If the Aura contributors & AEF deal is approved, the 200k OTC can be implemented using a similar contract to the one used for the Olympus deal (only difference being the price defined with a TWAP). This AIP execution should fall under ACI’s Skyward program scope.\n\nMarket acquisition: As AURA are likely to be mostly bought on market using TWAP orders which can be used with a Safe, the AURA buy and potential BPT sell can be executed by the GHO liquidity committee using the multisig once live (require a fallback handler on it). \n\nThis should simplify the acquisition compared to creating new contracts for this purpose. More information on TWAP orders can be found here.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf Option 1:\n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for AEF OTC deal\n- (AIP) Transfer all BPT from the collector to the committee multisig\n- Committee start TWAP orders BPT for USDC\n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer back USDC equivalent for OTC deal on the Collector\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\nIf Option 2:\n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for Aura deal\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to the committee multisig\n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\nIf Option 3: \n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for AEF deal\n- (AIP) Transfer AAVE from the ecosystem reserve to tokenswap contract for Aura deal\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to the committee multisig for market buy \n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\n## Voting Options TLDR \n\n- YAE (Option 1): Convert BPT for AURA to lock vlAURA \n- YAE (Option 2): Lock BPT for veBAL + buy AURA ($1M in USDC) to lock vlAURA\n- YAE (Option 3): Mint auraBAL with BPT & use rewards for bribes + buy AURA ($800k in USDC & AAVE) to lock vlAURA \n- NAY: Do nothing \n- ABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\nThis ARFC can be useful to pending proposals from SPs but is published on my own initiative and is not receiving any compensation.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Create and Fund GHO Liquidity Committee\nAuthor: @TokenLogic\nDated: 2023-09-08\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents Aave DAO the opportunity to create and fund the GHO Liquidity Committee for an initial 3 month duration.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the coming weeks, we expect the voting base to reallocate gauge votes away from GHO liquidity pools. This is largely due to those voting for GHO pools incurring an opportunity cost by not participating in the bribe market.\n\nIf the Aave DAO was to lock all of its BPT for veBAL, the gauge vote is equivalent to 1.8% of veBAL. Even with some voters continuing to support GHO, a good portion of the 7.7% will move to other pools. There is also the impact of [AIP-42](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682) for the DAO to consider. Voting support from external teams is expected to taper beyond what Aave DAO can replace with its own strategic assets. Furthermore, as the liquidity pools continue to grow additional gauge voting support is required to maintain the APR over time. Whilst the Aave Safety Module (SM) has the potential to be a more long term sustained solution, integrating BPTs that contain GHO, this requires time to develop and should not be rushed.\n\nMeanwhile, the [GHO price](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/) is consistently trading between 96 cents and 99 cents. When the liquidity in the GHO/Aave Boosted Pool was withdrawn, the GHO peg improved. This is because the pool was >85% GHO and had minimal USDC, USDT and DAI deposits. Increasing the GHO borrow rate is also expected to support the GHO peg as minting GHO to farm rewards in liquidity pools is less profitable.\n\n![|602x231](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7_4E7_tF8xRZe5tUFyoeXnJB3UbWDs7C7aGaohFzMjxM_aBGLmMvAREOjrtIS5yppMcrUaov3Q18-jIGcnjJk4x17wy91VheIUZSkIa0Y2a9Ay_kLTLRZ0w6zKR8PEpjE3jqJIBPzfF)\n\nThe LUSD/GHO pool on Maverick, is also heavily concentrated in GHO and migrating this liquidity to a wider liquidity band pool is expected to also help support the peg.\n\nCreating several concentrated liquidity pools is expected to help improve the GHO peg. These pools will have wide and narrow ranges. Liquidity will need to be migrated from the wide range to the narrow range pool over time. This will require more active management than what on-chain governance allows.\n\nThe recent CRV acquisition indicates the DAO will likely be supporting a GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve Finance. The current CRV holding can be used to kick start a pool, however additional support is likely to be needed to continue growing the pool. There is also a GHOFRAXBP pool being setup by the Frax team which can be co-incentivised. Pending how these pools progress, additional scope/budget may be added at a later stage.\n\nGiven the time sensitive nature of needing to support GHO liquidity, this publication proposes creating a Liquidity Committee with an initial budget. The committee shall focus solely on GHO liquidity and shall consist of a relatively small highly skilled team.\n\nThe Liquidity Committee can support GHO whilst other initiatives are being considered. Even after GHO liquidity pool receipt tokens are integrated into the SM, the Liquidity Committee can participate in bribe markets to boost the yield on the SM integrations.\n\nLonger term the DAO should revisit the impact of the committee and determine if it is still required. Furthermore, the composition of the committee should be revisited at a late date. With this in mind, this proposal suggests the Liquidity Committee’s initial mandate shall last for a 3 month duration.\n\n# Liquidity Strategy\n\nDetails on the liquidity strategy are to be detailed in a separate forum post. The liquidity strategy is to be implemented on the following Decentralise Exchanges:\n\n* Balancer\n* Maverick\n* Uniswap via Bunni\n\nThis forum post is to focus on the creation of the Liquidity Committee and associated fundings.\n\n# Performance Measures\n\nThe following performance measures are proposed:\n\n* Time GHO peg is above 98.5 cents and 99.0 cents\n  * % above/below 98.5 cents over trailing 7 days\n  * % above/below 99.0 cents over trailing 7 days\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Maverick\n  * Target $5M\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Uniswap\n  * Target $5M\n* Improvement in swap size for defined price impact via Cowswap or Paraswap\n  * 0.25% and 0.5% price impact to USDC\n* TVL in Balancer Liquidity Pools\n\nTarget $10M ($5M per pool)\n\nThese measures will be shown on the GHO Analytics platform provided by TokenLogic.\n\n# Committee Structure\n\nThe Liquidity Committee is to consist of 7 signers and will utilise a 4 of 7 SAFE to implement transactions. To ensure there is smooth operational consistency, there are distinct roles within the committee.\n\nTokenLogic will perform the following function:\n\n* Provide analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy\n* Liaise with teams that support the protocols hosting the GHO liquidity\n* Lead & Coordinate the committees weekly activities\n\nAll signers are to provide the following support:\n\n* Provide critical feedback / help refine the strategy\n* Verify and sign transactions\n\nIt should be noted, that actively managing liquidity takes time and effort to stay up to date with the attest events happening across all the protocols supporting GHO liquidity. Verifying transactions as a signer is also a notable time commitment.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe initial 3 months funding for the Liquidity Committee is as shown below:\n\n* 406,000 GHO - Liquidity Incentives\n* 5 ETH - Gas\n\nA breakdown of the Liquidity Incentive budget is shown below:\n![|602x224](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_P69n971i9uu38kLAiBQKpiESXHTZJc__Q6PKuvWCxxp7ZaHn7zU-eEVpFSHFcD1W2ZurPx49T-W4Dg0fY25krVHC07nZ0_XCQtyylq9LPafWuxv-G4Ca-19mWfE2-URZ-6BL94nIhH)\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the incentive budget and strategy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801).\n\nThere is a nominal 5 ETH allowance included in the budget. This amount was arbitrarily selected and ensures the SAFE & signing wallets are well funded.Some transactions can be executed directly from the SAFE.\n\nAny funds not used shall be returned to the Treasury or rolled over into supporting the next iteration of the Liquidity Committee.\n\n# Specification\n\nA Gnosis Safe will be created, this SAFE will hold funds and implement the quests. A small, high context team is proposed to implement the strategies modelled by the TokenLogic team.\n\n|Signer|Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Matthew Graham (TokenLogic)|0xb647055A9915bF9c8021a684E175A353525b9890|\n|Dydymoon (TokenLogic)|0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f|\n|Emilio|0x9C3E82658d10064121048A21c69978D3400abb25|\n|Marc (ACI)|0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4|\n|Figue (Paladin)|0x009d13E9bEC94Bf16791098CE4E5C168D27A9f07|\n|Solarcurve (Balancer)|0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3|\n|TokenBrice (DeFi Collective)|0xAA7A9d80971E58641442774C373C94AaFee87d66|\n\nTo fund the multisig, the following assets within the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO:\n\n* 406,000 [aEthDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n5 ETH and 406,000 units GHO are to be transferred from the Treasury to the Liquidity Committee multisig.\n\nAddress: `here`\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

It aims to enhance swap capabilities, enabling more flexible and efficient asset swaps with new features and developer tooling.",
