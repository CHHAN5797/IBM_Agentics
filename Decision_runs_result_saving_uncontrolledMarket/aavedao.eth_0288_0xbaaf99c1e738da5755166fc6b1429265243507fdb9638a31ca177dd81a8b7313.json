While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1.

The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2.

The user's current health score is 2.06.\n\n## Specification:\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | Debt Ceiling | 6,000,000 | 8,500,000 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard GUSD in isolation mode to the Ethereum Aave V3 Market.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs part of the community efforts on the V2 to V3 migration, Chaos Labs proposed a [multi-phased plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636) to promote V3 adoption. As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list GUSD on Aave V3 on Ethereum. GUSD is currently listed on V2 Ethereum as a non-collateral asset.\n\n## Liquidity and Market Cap\n\nWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at data from the past 180 days. The average market cap of GUSD over the past 180 days was ~$527M, and the average daily trading volume was ~$1M (CeFi & DeFi). \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreig3i5tpyiqm7khg4n6aydyq7vbyxstf5jjbxgkmzvqmenpr2kcig4)\n    \n\n## **Liquidation Threshold**\n\nAnalyzing GUSD price volatility over the past, we observed daily annualized volatility of 5.13% and 30-day annualized volatility of 2.38%. Considering this volatility and the history of GUSD on other networks, we recommend an initial LT of 75%.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreid5fugl7ekjkzjhkqinwcacz6d3dtg4xet5lqjd3anfqus6yzyabu)\n    \n\nWe recommend listing GUSD as borrowable, as we do not observe a significant risk to the protocol by allowing to borrow of GUSD, as long as it is bound by a well-defined cap.\n\n## **Debt Ceiling**\n\nFollowing [Chaos Labs’ Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440), we recommend an initial debt ceiling of $3.5M. Under the methodology for Isolation Mode, we consider two levels of probabilities for extreme price drops - Medium-High and High. We estimate the probability of an extreme price drop for GUSD as Medium-High. Given this debt ceiling, we do not identify a profitable attack vector under the current liquidity levels.\n\n## **Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and Liquidation Bonus**\n\nWhen evaluating the initial supply caps for migrated assets from Aave V2 Market, we carefully analyze the latest supply for the asset and consider it as the demand for supplying the asset. We then ensure that this amount is aligned with the current liquidity on-chain. \n\nFurthermore, we take into account the debt ceiling calculated using our methodology and derive a supply cap that aligns with the debt ceiling. This approach is aimed at minimizing the risks associated with listing assets while ensuring that the supply cap is aligned with the overall liquidity of the platform and the potential risks that the asset might pose to the protocol.\n\nAccordingly, We recommend a supply cap of 5M GUSD, and a borrow cap of 4M GUSD.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidosn43yn65cigdxvfbcaepq7mrgnq7lqnc2feazxocchdd7go3ei)\n    \n\nGiven the concentrated liquidity of GUSD we recommend a 5% Liquidation Bonus.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibp7fbiom3mgd6oku5zozp2hwlordd57ogxl3fnivvww5hs7kstwi)\n    \n\nFor the **Reserve Factor**, **Liquidation Protocol Fee**, and **Interest Rate curves**, we recommend aligning the parameters to the other stablecoins currently on Ethereum V3.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: GUSD\n\nContract Address: [0x056Fd409E1d7A124BD7017459dFEa2F387b6d5Cd](https://etherscan.io/address/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd)\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (GUSD) | 5M |\n| Borrow Cap (GUSD) | 4M |\n| Debt Ceiling | $3.5M |\n| LTV | 70.00% |\n| LT | 75.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5.00% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 75.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 80.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n2.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) for CRV on Aave V3 Polygon.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the market liquidity of CRV has seen a substantial decline, this proposal seeks to address this by decreasing the liquidation threshold (LT) for CRV on Polygon V3. The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market conditions and its parameters on other deployments.\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Analysis\n\nChaos Labs recommends a 15% reduction. As of October 25, seven total accounts amounting to ~$141 are at risk of liquidation following the proposed changes.\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | 65% | 50% | 141 | 8 |\n\nList of affected accounts:\n\n| Account | Total Supply (USD) | Total CRV Supplied | Total Borrows (USD) | Health | Health After Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0x9ce21324617b6b573e75d28580dcd5a88c41b4bb | 106 | 29.16 | 86.47 | 1.01 | 0.99 |\n| 0xa21fa160a63993d06daf2cb22f66b9a118a25ed4 | 97 | 200.43 | 59.14 | 1.07 | 0.83 |\n| 0xf36375ef8ef450476541f6326631cac44f9f0a49 | 58 | 40.18 | 41.22 | 1.07 | 0.99 |\n| 0xe9784ffc614fe5cc57939cc7b21cdd2cf8f61c86 | 17 | 34.88 | 10.60 | 1.09 | 0.86 |\n| 0x6c62b64c4e1a4702a41c47d5cdafc29fcba0ebad | 12 | 25.77 | 6.63 | 1.23 | 0.95 |\n| 0xdb79b400a31997ebc6816f002f2b622fe186056a | 12 | 25.57 | 6.63 | 1.22 | 0.94 |\n| 0x0906f3f07c7211bdce20d8a7cf9bdd7c3306532d | 4 | 6.7 | 2.65 | 1.14 | 0.96 |\n| 0x304481771f4922b60a759ac363da3a7da6372cc1 | 4 | 0.83 | 3.5 | 1.02 | 1.00 |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 65% | 50% | -15% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs have not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
