        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Consolidate Collector Contract & Secure Service Provider Runway\nauthor: @llama - @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-05-13\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes swapping many long tail assets for aUSDC to be used for Service Provider renumeration.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAave DAO's service provider aUSDC burn rate exceeds the aUSDC revenue. Consequently, assets held in the Ethereum Collector Contract need to be periodically swapped to USDC and deposited in Aave v2.\n\nThis publication intends to swap several assets via Cowswap to USDC. The USDC is to be deposited in Aave v2 for aUSDC and then used to remunerate Service Providers via the various streaming contracts.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThere is currently $1.7M aUSDC held in the Ethereum Collector contract.\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 14.58.27.png](ipfs://bafkreih2zwytnlor2pzedirxhxigqpxzmmv53npsavxnvebma4rspuqb4i)\n    \nThere are a number of Service Providers requiring payment in aUSDC. The below summarises all of Aave's active Service Provider commitments.\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 14.57.38.png](ipfs://bafkreifmfxwvqzchg5awoz6kxioz67gvdklnmypsvoqfjruow4lupf3dv4)\n    \nDetails of each Service Providers funding can be found [here](https://community.llama.xyz/aave/runway) by hovering the cursor over the respective Service Providers contract. Similar applies for the contract start and finish dates.\n\nIn order to provide sufficient funding, assets need to be converted to aUSDC. This publication proposes swapping assets to USDC and then depositing the USDC into Aave v2. The amount of aUSDC held post swap is estimated to be $4.5M which is sufficient to sustain the DAO in the short term.\n\nDuring the next 6 months several Service Providers funding will expire and require re-approval from the DAO. Llama anticipates Service Providers migrating from aUSDC to aethUSDC. ie: from v2 to v3 aToken funding. Our next proposal will include transferring funds from Aave v2 to v3 which is an enabler for new funding requests to use aethTokens. \n\n# Specification\n\nPerform the following:\n\n* Redeem assets from various Aave deployments\n* Claim accumulated fees from Paraswap\n* Swap non USDC nominated assets to USDC via Cowswap\n* Deposit USDC in Aave v2 \n\n[EthereumClaimPayload](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-paraswap-claimer/blob/main/src/contracts/EthereumClaimPayload.sol) prepared by @bgdlabs.

Here, we propose that v2 aTokens be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury address. From the v3 Treasury address, the tokens can be deposited into Aave v3.\n\nUtilisation across the v2 deployment is low and there is excess liquidity within each reserve that enables Aave's aTokens to be redeemed without affecting users.\n\nLlama proposes migrating liquidity at the first available opportunity. There is also ongoing and soon to be expanded liquidity mining occurring on the Aave v3 deployment. \n\n## Consolidate Assets\n\nSimilar to a proposal relating to the [Ethereum v2 Collector Contract consolidation](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-collector-contract-consolidation/10909), we suggest swapping all JEUR, SUSHI, GHST + DPI to USDT. \n\nThe general flow of events is redeeming xSUSHI, GHST and DPI from the v3 Treasury and then swapping the assets for USDT.\n\n|Network|Deployment|Ticker|Price|Quantity|USD Value|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolDPI|$70.85|2.29| $ 161.96 |\n|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolSUSHI|$1.27|2,055.89| $ 2,610.97 |\n|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolJEUR|$1.05|2,622.03| $ 2,753.13 |\n|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolGHST|$1.04|2,788.45| $ 2,899.98 |\n|||||Total| $ 8,426.05 |\n\nWhy USDT, Aave holds more DAI and USDC on Polygon than USDT. If Aave was to deploy liquidity into a 3pool, then more USDT would be required when depositing equal amounts of each asset into the pool. The vlaue of the assets being swapped to USDT is very small relative to exisitng stable coin holdings. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following assets held within the v2 Collector Contract are to be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury wallet.\n\nUsing 1inch's Fusion in auto mode perform the following:\n\n1. Redeem aPolGHST, aPOLjEUR, aPolSUSHI and aPolDPI\n2. Approve GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI\n3. Swap all GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI to USDT\n4. Deposit USDT into Aave v3 USDT Reserve\n\nFusion offers MEV protection and Cowswap is not deployed on Polygon. \n\nContract Address references:\n\naPolGHST: `0x8Eb270e296023E9D92081fdF967dDd7878724424` \naPolSUSHI: `0xc45A479877e1e9Dfe9FcD4056c699575a1045dAA` \naPolDPI: `0x724dc807b04555b71ed48a6896b6F41593b8C637` \naPOLJEUR: `0x6533afac2E7BCCB20dca161449A13A32D391fb00`\nGHST: `0x385Eeac5cB85A38A9a07A70c73e0a3271CfB54A7`\nSUSHI: `0x0b3F868E0BE5597D5DB7fEB59E1CADBb0fdDa50a`\nDPI: `0x85955046DF4668e1DD369D2DE9f3AEB98DD2A369`\njEUR: `0x4e3Decbb3645551B8A19f0eA1678079FCB33fB4c`\nUSDT: `0xc2132d05d31c914a87c6611c10748aeb04b58e8f`\naPolUSDT: `0x6ab707Aca953eDAeFBc4fD23bA73294241490620`\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].\n\nAave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.\n\nOption 1) Locking veBAL.\nOption 2) Staking auraBAL.\n\nOption 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).\n\nA Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.\n\nAave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:\n\n* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].\n* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].\n* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].\n\nThis proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.\n\n## Option 1) Locking veBAL\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nIn Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.\n\n### What’s veBAL ?\n\nveBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc\n\n* **Gauge-weight Power**\nVoting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.\n\n* **Governance Power**\nVoting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.\n\n* **veBoost**\nLocking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.\n\n* **Protocol Fees**\n75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].\n\n### veBAL Position Overview\n\nBy maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].\n\nWith 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).\n\nBAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.\n\nAave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies\n* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n\nThe boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.\n\nThere remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].\n\n### veBAL yield overview\n\nThe veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:\n\n* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)\n* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)\n* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold\n\nIn the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week\n\nveBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92\n\n* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.\n\nIt’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.\n\n## Option 2) Staking auraBAL\n\nOption 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.\n\nAfter the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].\n\nDepositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.\n\nThe yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.\n\n* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.\n* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).\n* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.\n\nGrowing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.\n\nWith 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.\n\nBy staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].\n\nOption 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.\n\n## Comments\n\nTo help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.\n\nThere are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nTo summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|\n|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|\n|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|\n\nThe amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at\n\nLlama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:\n\n1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH\n2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap\n3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.\n![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)\nThe BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL\n4. Approve BAL on Cowswap\n5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH\n\n![|312x312](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NyamWu2oOW0-UTQrXfcgD2kR4Z6J64pqWmD2kFrcZd_8Ay-MrXsGlGtIXnKSbhcHjzvfFFMtGTc_Hlpuel5Qp0j8GevSPNkqB9AkPN5LZhQLmAW-c8jYmESZPCkEI4QkSc8QaOhdFarIytRV6uq2QNA)\n\nAave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.\n\nAt the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70\n$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56\n\nIn performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).\n\nThe number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.\n\n\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.\n\nThose considerations are:\n\n* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade\n* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]\n* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmVqWgpRmoEvvhvXZFepmAgYU5ZK9XpSs39MExEUpiJZw3\n[3] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484/19\n[5] https://dune.com/queries/782195/1395498\n[6] https://app.warden.vote/dashboard/\n[7] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ac1109d58b02b5b74f10d92fb816a9cdc4b198fd455cc2bb2fdbb52ae84f9e\n[8] https://etherscan.io/token/0x616e8BfA43F920657B3497DBf40D6b1A02D4608d?a=0x5e5ea2048475854a5702f5b8468a51ba1296efcc\n[9] https://dev.balancer.fi/resources/deploy-pools-from-factory/creation/aavelinearpool\n[10] https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n[11] https://app.aura.finance/#/lock\n[12] https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249\n[13] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [13].",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: ARC - Strategic Partnership with Balancer Part #2\nstatus: Discussion\nauthor: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham\ncreated: 03-05-2022\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nAcquire 100,000 BAL tokens by deploying a Bonding Curve contract. The BAL tokens are to be held in the Reserve Factor until further details relating to Aura emerges and then the Aave community can determine if to deploy BAL to receive veBAL or auraBAL, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nDeploy a Bonding Curve to acquire an additional 100,000 BAL tokens on market at the chainlink oracle price +50 bps, for a cost $1,708,500 assuming a BAL price of $17. This is an additional purchase to the 200,000 BAL token swap being considered.\n\nAave will become one of eight token holders with 300,000 BAL tokens. All 100,000 BAL tokens are to be retained in the Reserve Factor until such time as further information on auraBAL emerges.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe original motivation for performing a token swap with Balancer can be found on the ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token, [2].\n\nWith the additional 100,000 BAL acquisition, Aave would transition from just outside the Top 50 BAL holder to inside the Top 30 holders, [3]. If an additional 75,000 BAL was acquired, totalling 375,000 BAL, then Aave would become a Top 20 holder and this includes three community wallets, one Polygon bridge pool and the main BAL liquidity pool. So really it would be more like the Top 15 holders if another 75,000 BAL was acquired.\n\nWith 300,000 BAL tokens, Aave would have the largest BAL holding of any strategic partner Balancer has partnered with. The largest strategic partnership holding to date is the 270,000 BAL position held by Tribe DAO, [4,5]. Having a larger BAL holding relative to Tribe DAO may become a competitive advantage as Tribe DAO seeks to direct TVL to Rari Fuse pools with the use of the new ERC-4626 vault, [6].\n\nWith the emergence of ERC-4626, a new type of vault, whereby Liquidity Providers (LP) can deposit their stakes BPT tokens into lending pools and earn BAL rewards whilst using staked BPT as collateral, [7]. This is particularly appealing for staked BPT holdings which have minimal Impermanent loss risk. An example would be to use the staked BPT token for the stable coin Balancer Boosted Pool which uses Aave V2 to generate yield and receives BAL rewards, [8]. Based upon the success of wstETH being listed on Aave V2, this may lead to significant Total Value Locked (TVL) growth for Aave which makes up more than 13% of Aave’s mainnet V2 market TVL, [9].\n\nHaving not yet entered in the Curve / Convex tokenomics play, Aave has an opportunity to be an early leader in the veBAL wars. With the emergence of Aura, the Aave community has a choice to determine if the 100,000 BAL to be acquired are to be deployed for veBAL or auraBAL. If Aura is like Convex, then being early and building an Aura holding is worth considering. The first step in both strategies is to acquire a sizable BAL position and as the initial 200,000 BAL is proposed to be deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year, the 100,000 BAL detailed within this proposal can be deployed into either veBAL or auraBAL contracts.\n\nThere are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using either veBAL or auraBAL to vote for BAL rewards towards pools that create TVL for Aave is a strategic advantage. If Aura evolves like Convex did, then the voter locked AURA token will have more voting influence over BAL rewards than one veBAL token. Being prepared and ready for the Aura token launch is going to position Aave to maximise the upside from its investments as rewards often favour early movers.\n\n# Implementation\n\nA Bonding Curve deployment utilising Chainlink’s BAL/USD oracle feed with a 50 bps incentive for arbitrage trades to acquire BAL on market and deposit into the contract. Aave will provide USDC to fund the Bonding Curve contract. An example of this type of transaction occurred when Tribe purchased $10M of DPI on market, [10].\n\nThe 50 bps fee is to provide an economic incentive for arbitrage traders to attain BAL on market and deposit BAL into the contract profitably by more than offsetting gas costs. This mechanism enables everyone within defi to participate and essentially crowdsources the BAL tokens on Aave’s behalf. Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor.\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer/7617/15\n[3] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[4] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888\n[5] https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x7972e1700ac30495ad936038b66055b1e6420c3de5ed1fec963abe5faa2d16a3\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023\n[7] https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626\n[8] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[9] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&marketName=proto_mainnet\n[10] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Repay Excess CRV Debt on Ethereum v2\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - @MatthewGraham \nDated: 2022-12-08\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis publication proposes sourcing CRV for the purpose of repaying the excess debt in the CRV Reserve on the Ethereum v2 liquidity pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere are approximately 2,656,335 units of CRV of excessive debt in the Ethereum v2 CRV Reserve. At 66.35 cents per unit, a total of 1,762,478.27 USD, in the form of CRV tokens, is required to recapitalise the protocol. \n\nTo recapitalise the protocol, Llama proposes acquiring the full amount of CRV required to repay the excess debt from the existing USDC and aUSDC holdings.\n\nAave currently holds 6M units of aUSDC and 358.7k units of USDC in the Ethereum Collector Contract.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDecide on a path forward to repay the excess debt in the CRV market (currently ~$1.76M USD, dependent on CRV's token price). Llama proposes using funds held in the Aave v2 Collector Contract to repay the excess debt. As the excess debt must be paid in CRV tokens, Aave is required to acquire 2,152,041 units of CRV.\n\nThere is currently an active proposal whereby Gauntlet's insolvency fund (valued at around $280k) is to be transferred to the Economic Reserve. The insolvency fund only offsets a portion of the total cost incurred by Aave. There has been no indication of support from the community for using AAVE held within the Safety Module or from the Ecosystem Reserve to recapitalise the protocol. If Aave was to sell AAVE or stkAAVE to fund the CRV acquisition, there are two non exclusive ways of doing this:\n\n1) Auction via the shortfall event\n2) Swap contract where anyone can swap AAVE or stkAAVE for CRV\n\nOption 2 eliminates the need for negotiating any terms with a counterparty, or any counterparty needing to review contracts prior to interacting with a whitelisted contract. It is worth noting the Collector Contract holds insufficient AAVE or stkAAVE to support using AAVE <> CRV swaps. Any swap contract of this nature requires using the Economic Reserve. General discussion to date has indicated little appetite to sell AAVE to fund excessive debt.  \n\nThere has been some interest from the community to use the aCRV holding, currently 504,294 units, in the Ethereum Collector Contract to partially recapitalise the protocol. This is a partial solution  that is equivalent to just 18.98% ($334.6k) of the required CRV size needed. If the community was to use the aCRV position, a further 1,647,747 units of CRV are to be acquired.\n\nWith the launch of a new aToken, expected soon, Curve liquidity tokens can be deposited into Aave and still receive CRV rewards from the Curve gauges. Aave has the option to deploy the aCRV holding to veCRV and direct rewards towards Curve gauges that benefit the Aave ecosystem. This has the potential to become a meaningful income stream for Aave.\n\nIf Aave was to incur a delay in creating veCRV, historically this is one of the highest yielding reserves which is why CRV is the largest earning asset outside of the major stable coins. In more normal environments, over a 150 to 200 day period, the CRV reserve would generate sufficient yield to repay the excessive debt. This revenue source , CRV yield, would be lost if aCRV was used to fund repaying the excessive debt. Due to the potential upside, this publication supports retaining the aCRV holding.\n\nAs part of a broader consolidation of the Ethereum Collector Contract, approximately [$434.6k of assets](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-collector-contract-consolidation/10909) are to be swapped for USDC. This represents 24.7% of the funds required to recapitalise the protocol.\n\n### Holdings Summary\n\n| Holding          | $ Value     | % of Excessive Debt |\n| --------------   | -----------          | ------------------- |\n| aUSDC            | 6,002,226.07|              340.56      |\n| USDC             | 358,701.07  |                20.35      |\n| v2 Consolidation | 434,570.98  |           24.70      |\n| aCRV             | 330,834.02  |                18.98     |\n| Excessive Debt   | 1,762,478.27|          100       |\n\nThe table shows there is in total 385.61% more USDC relative to the excessive debt value. Do note this is only the USDC portion of the Collector Contract. There is also large DAI ($4,684,700.46) and USDT ($3,915,311.69) holdings.\n\nDue to the relative size of the USDC and the upside potential to the new aToken developed by Aave Companies, Llama suggests the community utilise the USDC and aUSDC holdings to acquire the full amount of CRV needed to recapitalise the protocol.\n\n# Specification\n\nDeploy a swap contract exchanging USDC and aUSDC for CRV. \n\nThe exchange rate is the Chainlink CRV/USD Oracle + 10 bps.\n\nCRV/USD Oracle: `0xCd627aA160A6fA45Eb793D19Ef54f5062F20f33f`\n\nEstimated Premium: 1,762,478.27 * 0.0010 = $1,762.48\nA $15,000 swap via ParaSwap at 14 gwei + depositing into the swap contract is estimated to cost $12 - $15, 10 bps is $15.\n\nA cap of $2M will be placed on swap contract. This is a defined ceiling which limits the amount of funds allocated for acquiring CRV on market. This essentially creates an upper price bound on the CRV price of 75.29 cents, which is a 13% above the current spot price, 66.35 cents. \n\nThe actor interacting with the swap contract will have the ability to select USDC and aUSDC by choosing true or false respectively.\n\nTo repay the excess debt, the repay function will be used. This function requires CRV as an input and the address the bad debt has accumulated within.\n\npool.repay(crv, total bad debt, variableInterest, Address)\n\nCRV: `ethereum:0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52`\nTotal Excessive Debt: 2,656,335 units of CRV\nAddress: `0x57e04786e231af3343562c062e0d058f25dace9e`\n\n# Next Steps\n\nDiscuss in the comment section the above proposal. A Snapshot will be presented for the two most popular options. At the time of writing, these appear to be:\n\nOption 1) Use USDC to acquire CRV\nOption 2) Use aCRV + USDC to acquire CRV\nOption 3) Do Not Recapitalise Protocol\n\nOption 3 gives the community the ability to not recapitalise the protocol.\n\nIf the Community was to prefer to sell AAVE, the preferred mechanism is a swap contract at the AAVE/CRV composite oracle rate. ie: AAVE/USD x USD/CRV >> AAVE/CRV There would be no premium offered such a swap. Let us know what you think in the comments.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
