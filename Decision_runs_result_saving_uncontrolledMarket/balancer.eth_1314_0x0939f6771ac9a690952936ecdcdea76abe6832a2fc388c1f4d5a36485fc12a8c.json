The price is to be determined by the 90-day moving average when an AIP is presented for voting via Aave’s governance process, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nWith a successful Balancer Snapshot vote, an AIP will be presented for the Aave community to vote on. If passed, the contracts will be deployed enabling 200,000 BAL tokens to be deposited and the AAVE held within withdrawn. After the tokens are withdrawn, each community is able to use the newly acquired tokens without restriction.\n\nAave intends to deposit BAL, with matching ETH, into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool and then deposit the receipt token into the vested escrow contract, locking them for 1 year. The veBAL voting influence is to be used for directing BAL incentives to liquidity pools that create TVL or provide a backstop for Aave markets, [2].\n\nA separate forum post will emerge requesting the Aave Reserve Factor address be added to the Voting Escrow contract whitelist.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE/ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drives TVL to Aave V2 market, [3]. In time, Aave intends to upgrade the Safety Module from 80/20 AAVE/ETH pool on Balancer V2. There are many more opportunities for both communities to work together and a tokenswap only further strengthens this relationship.\n\nAave’s veBAL voting influence can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [4]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Bootstrapping these pools benefits both communities and only strengthens the already strong relationship.\n\nBy exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. Using data from Etherscan, the tokenswap is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder and for Balancer to become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5,6]. Both communities will have influence in the other’s governance process and be aligned through ownership to collaborate in growing the adoption of both protocols.\n\nThe initial sizing of 200,000 BAL was reached by attaining input from some members of the Balancer community. The tokenswap is also the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer DAO token swap, [7]. In addition to the tokenswap outlined here, the Aave community is also considering purchasing an additional 100,000 BAL via a bonding curve on market, [8]. This is a separate proposal and is still in the discussion phase on Aave’s governance forum.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe tokenswap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [9].\n\nUpon withdrawing AAVE from the contract, the Balancer community can deploy the holding without restriction from this proposal.\n\nBoth organisations can at any moment terminate the agreement through their respective governance systems.\n\n# References:\n\n[1] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-1/7617\n[2] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512\n[3] https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81/\n[4] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[5] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[6] https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#balances\n[7] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023\n[8] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813\n[9] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&marketName=proto_mainnet\n\n\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/2110/17).\n\n\n## Simple Summary\nThe partnership aims to align the interests of GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO, by increasing the collaboration between both organizations. The technical teams of both DAOs would carry out developments in the best interest of both organizations, such as completing [Stage 3](https://medium.com/@gnosisPM/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1#:~:text=and%20better%20UX.-,Stage%203%20(Soon),-Balancer%2DGnosis%2DProtocol) of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer would then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found, eventually leading to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.\n\nAlso, joint marketing efforts will be made, together with a token swap, to align governance interests.\n\n## Abstract\nEven though GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO have common interests, their current level of collaboration and integration isn’t enough to achieve their common goals. A partnership agreement would be necessary to increase the depth and breadth of their joint efforts, improving coordination and resource allocation to common projects.\n\nThis improvement proposal has already passed phase 1 in both protocols:\nhttps://forum.gnosis.io/t/treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/1440\nhttps://balancergrants.notion.site/DAO-Agreement-Process-a871f46c41f043fd83bce34007eb14ab\n\n## Motivation\nWe believe that achieving a greater synergy between BalancerDAO and GnosisDAO would significantly strengthen both organizations, allowing for a more efficient planning and execution of their joint projects, backed up by healthier treasuries, with increased token diversification.\n\n## Specification\nBoth parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnership:\n\n**Technical**\nJoint work of technical teams of both DAOs to carry out developments in the best interest of both DAOs, such as completing Stage 3 of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer will then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found. This will eventually lead to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.\n\n**Marketing**\nTo ensure both entities will profit from each other's reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where useful.\n\n**Token Transaction**\nTo align governance interests, a Token Swap between the two organizations is initiated as part of this agreement.\n\n200,000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund would be exchanged for the equivalent USD value of GNO in equal proportions from DAO Treasury, using the 90 day smooth moving average price at the time that voting ends.\n\nBoth organizations commit to holding the received assets for a period of at least 1 year. No on-chain logic will be implemented to ensure this.\n\n## Rationale\nGnosis and Balancer have worked together for the past years. The protocols have [integrated Cowswap with Balancer V2](https://medium.com/@gnosisPM/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1) to enable better gas prices and UX, MEV protection, no gas fees for failed transactions, better prices due to the optimized pool settlements and use of the Balancer v2 single vault architecture.\n\n**Partnership Term**\nThe Partnership is open-ended and does not have an expiry date.\n\n**Partnership Governance**\nThe partnership is managed by representatives of the organizations directed by the respective governance processes of the organizations. In the case of this partnership, there are 2 representatives for each organization.\n\n**Exit Clause**\nBoth organizations can at any moment terminate the agreement through their respective governance systems.\n\n**Communications around the Partnership**\n- A Partnership announcement blog will be created within the 2 weeks following the agreement date.\n\n- To ensure operational effectiveness, a monthly call will be set up with at least one representative of each entity\n\nBoth DAOs acknowledge that DAO agreements are inherently unpredictable and irreversible and agree to this initial partnership agreement.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would initiate a transaction to send 200,000 BAL to GnosisDAO (0x849d52316331967b6ff1198e5e32a0eb168d039d)\n\nGnosisDAO will send the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) 9051 GNO in exchange.

PrimeDAO will support the development of the BalancerDAO and, where possible, share learnings and resources with BalancerDAO.\nBalancerDAO will get early access to Prime Deals 2, an Interface for DAO to DAO interactions, such as token swaps co-liquidity provision, and joint venture formation, to give input, to ensure the product serves the needs of BalancerDAO.\n\n## Technical\n\nPrimeDAO will continue to host Balancer LBP through Prime Launch and support the development of LBPs on Balancer.\nPrimeDAOs builders will continue to support the development of the Balancer Protocol.\nPrimeDAOs will support the development of the Balancer Protocol on alternative blockchains, currently evaluating the deployment of Balancer V2.0 on Celo and xDAI chain in collaboration with Symmetric, with the potential for it to develop into a Balancer Friendly Fork.\n\n## Operational\n\nBoth DAOs will actively share DAO operational learnings and workflows, starting with a bi-monthly knowledge-sharing session covering three topics relevant to both DAOs. The first session will be organized in mid-January.\n\n## Marketing\n\nTo ensure both entities will profit from each other’s reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.\n\n## Co-liquidity provision:\n\nTo align governance interests, between the two organizations, the creation of a co-liquidity pool is proposed with the following details; 25,000 BAL from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund would be transferred to PrimeDAO at the end of PrimeDAO own LBP to bootstrap a PRIME / BAL pool with 50/50 weights and 2,5% trading fees. Right after the conclusion of the PRIME LBP, PrimeDAO will seed a pool with the 25,000 BAL and match it with the same $ value in Prime. Once the pool is initiated, PrimeDAO will transfer 50% of the Balancer Pool Tokens to the Balancer Ecosystem Fund to complete the transaction.\n\nThe pool will again be called the Balancer <> PRIME pool (BLxPR) and function as a liquidity bridge between the two DAOs. The BLxPR pool will be one of the two main liquidity pools for PrimeDAO.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe BLxPR token will be added to the Snapshot strategies of both DAOs to allow BLxPR token holders to participate in the Governance of both protocols.\nA new snapshot will be set-up with the BLxPR as the governing token. This snapshot will be used to govern issues related to this DAO agreement.\n\n## Pool Optimization\n\nPrimeDAO aims to create deep liquidity between BAL <> PRIME to be able to bring more projects and liquidity to the Balancer Protocol. PrimeDAO aims to do this by actively engaging in D2D agreement with other DAOs and creating PRIME / xxx pools on the Balancer Protocol.\nPrimeDAO also aims to leverage the various upcoming Balancer Pools in combination with PrimeDAOs existing products. Prime Rating could potentially be utilized to create research-driven managed pools and Prime Deals could be connected to the Balancer Protocol to allow multiple DAOs to bootstrap a pool together in a completely permissionless way.\n\n## Specification\nAt the end of the PrimeDAO LBP, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) will initiate a transaction to send 25,000 BAL to PrimeDAO (0x567d220B0169836cBF351DF70A9c517096ec9De7)\n\nPrimeDAO will match that with an equal USD amount of PRIME to create the BAL<>PRIME pool and send the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) half the BPT's.",

        "title": "[BIP-362] Restructure the Joint Balancer / Beethoven X Deployment on Optimism",
        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "Authors: Beethoven X contributors (composers and music directors)\n\nThis proposal presents an opportunity to position Balancer and Aura as the leading forces of technology on Optimism. It aims to seize the upcoming launch of Aura to leverage cross-chain Balancer boosts, restructures the network's liquidity, and propel Balancer, Beethoven X, and Aura toward increased market dominance. This proposal seeks to do so by proposing a modified protocol fee structure and core pool framework, similar to other successful Balancer deployments.\n\n**Background and Motivation**\n\nOptimism's bedrock upgrade has transformed the Superchain thesis into reality. With the impending Base Launch and the continuous development of the OP stack, we believe Optimism is poised to attract greater attention and liquidity. With the launch of Aura, these developments present an opportunity to cement the joint Balancer and Beethoven X deployment as a core technology and liquidity host on the network.\n\nSince the approval of the Beethoven X friendly fork of Balancer in November 2021, the partnership between the two protocols has flourished into a truly unique relationship. Nowhere else in DeFi has a fork become an essential SP of the original protocol. For the last year, we have recognized we are stronger when we work together, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve and building a better ecosystem along the way. If we look back, the joint Optimism deployment was the pivotal milestone in the expanding relationship between these two protocols. \n\nSince its launch in July 2022, the joint Balancer and Beethoven X Optimism deployment has demonstrated its innovative prowess, becoming the primary host of LST liquidity, amassing $60 million in TVL in April 2023, and generating approximately $370k in protocol revenue. While these metrics are indeed commendable, there is room for improvement. With the recent emergence of L2 veBAL Boost powered by LayerZero, there is the opportunity to leverage the impending launch of Aura and make considerable improvements to network market share. \n\nThis proposal seeks to optimize the current incentive structure to coincide with Aura's launch. Specifically, it aims to restructure the distribution of protocol fees to bootstrap an enhanced liquidity flywheel on the network and adopt a modified Balancer core pool model per BIP-19, supplemented by Beethoven X’s Optimism grant.\n\n**Current Protocol Fee Distribution**\n\nIn line with other Balancer deployments, the joint Balancer/Beethoven X deployment currently allocates 50% of swap fees and yield capture as protocol fees, with the remaining portion directed towards LPs. Based on initial governance approvals, both DAOs agreed to a [50](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xd281d8cad43c97814b2496270498c4396b16c0f2ce522d5bc554aae9fed4e4d7) / [50](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x2856e059b7bf581ee97ce63b36d79d85c3f27910ec5c79115de3d0d9fadc948c) split of the protocol fees as part of the joint deployment.\n\nBeethovenX's governance adopted an [additional proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x94ca4387a061af6df49ce3fefd9439e7399e7af152c59b56b370a43705eed4c1), where it committed to allocate 50% of its share of the protocol fees, converted to OP, matched with Beethoven X's OP grant, and emitted to pools as liquidity mining or gauge incentives. In certain instances when positive ROI was achieved, these incentives were directed towards Hidden Hand's OP vlAURA gauge market, but have more often been used as direct liquidity incentives.\n\nBeethoven X's grant-matching approach is a sustainable incentive model designed for long-term success. Other partnerships, such as Rocket Pool, have played a pivotal role in bootstrapping liquidity by directing their OP grants toward Optimism pools. However, the joint deployment has faced limitations in competing with the incentives provided by other protocols due to the number of incentives the joint deployment can currently emit based on the portion of protocol revenue flowing to Beethoven X.\n\n**The Value of Optimism Deployment**\n\nFrom January 1 to June 30, 2023, approximately $77.8k in BAL rewards have been emitted to OP pools through veBAL, while Balancer's revenue share directed towards the DAO treasury amounted to approximately $125.5k, resulting in a positive net cash flow. During the same period, Beethoven X incentivized pools with $56.6k worth of BEETS tokens, recycling half ($62.8k) as incentives from its share of protocol fees matched with OP.\n\nWith the anticipated launch of Aura and cross-chain veBAL boosts, Beethoven X, Balancer, and Aura will unlock more efficient means to foster liquidity growth. Historically, Aura has provided the Balancer ecosystem with an additional liquidity layer enabling efficient vote markets. As such, Beethoven X's current OP grant matching program can shift to being deployed as gauge vote incentives to direct BAL and AURA emissions to increase protocol TVL efficiently. If voting market efficiencies reduce, the incentive program can continue to emit direct liquidity mining incentives on pools. Aura has also [proposed an OP grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-28011280168279695) that would direct additional direct LP incentives or match bounties placed on any Aura voting markets with OP.\n\nBy leveraging the cross-chain veBAL boost and providing an efficient liquidity layer, combined with potential OP matching, Aura is a growth catalyst for the Balancer and Beethoven X deployment. With these additional optimizations to our incentive systems, we can ensure that our entire ecosystem substantially increases market share and revenue potential on Optimism.\n\n**Core Pool Framework**\n\nThe Balancer Core Pool Framework implemented through [BIP-19](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc), allows us to designate certain pools as \"core pools.\" Under this framework, protocol fees earned on other Balancer L2 deployments are utilized as gauge incentives for core pools on those networks, accelerating the adoption of L2s within the Balancer Ecosystem. BIP-19 was approved to collect and allocate 65% of the fees of all pools and proportionately direct them as gauge incentives to each L2's core pools to bootstrap their liquidity.\n\nGauge Framework v1, as proposed in [BIP-57](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-57-introduce-gauge-framework-v1/3604), introduced rating criteria for the Balancer community to evaluate all current and future veBAL gauges. This framework incorporates an \"overall\" factor, derived from the \"weight\" factor and \"market cap\" factor, as well as a \"revenue\" factor. It imposes a 2% cap, 10% cap, or no cap to gauges.\n\nBIPs-19 and 57 have also been applied to designate at least two 80/20 pools, Radiant and Alchemix, as uncapped core pools, in lieu of receiving ve80/20 grants\n\nThis proposal aims to adopt these frameworks for the Balancer/Beethoven X deployment on Optimism. However, we propose a modification to the distribution system: Rather than distributing incentives between core pools based on TVL, we propose incentives are distributed based on protocol fees generated by each pool, a calculation that can be efficiently derived using the [Beethoven X dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c).\n\n**Specification**\n\nThis proposal seeks to ensure that we bootstrap the launch of Aura in the most efficient way possible with two changes.\n\n1. Adopting a modified version of Balancer’s protocol fee distribution\n2. Establishing an Optimism core pool framework\n\n**Adopting Modified Version of Balancer’s Protocol Fee Distribution.**\n\nWe propose the joint Beethoven X / Balancer deployment on Optimism adopts the same 65/35 Protocol Fee distribution structure as other Balancer deployments: 65% of the fees used as incentives on the vote market for Optimism pools, and 35% goes to DAOs, with an equal split between Beethoven X and Balancer. \n\nIf approved, this action would take place as soon as possible to capitalize on Aura’s launch on the network. 65% of the fees would be utilized to buy OP and direct OP as voting incentives for core pools. The resulting action would see 65% of all protocol fees paired with OP from the Beethoven-X/Balancer OP grant, meaning a net 130% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives. \n\nThere is also the potential for further matching from Aura’s OP grant request. If Aura’s OP grant is also approved, this would see a net 260% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives for vlAura voters while the grants are active. Voters will see an increase in voting incentives that go towards pools of Optimism with the potential to increase even further with every voting cycle due to the positive flywheel effect.\n\nProtocol fees are currently collected every two weeks with all fees sent to the Beethoven X Treasury on Optimism automatically. Balancer DAOs share is then bridged to the Balancer Treasury on Mainnet. The proposal aims to keep this procedure to streamline the process of OP grant matching, with OP directed towards voting incentives for vlAura voters, or as direct Liquidity mining incentives depending on voting efficiencies. \n\n**Adapting the Core Pool Framework for Optimism**\n\nThe Optimism deployment will adhere to the Balancer Core Pool Framework that is in place for all other chains. However, we propose to add a slight change to the distribution mechanism: Instead of distributing the voting incentives based on the TVL of the pools, we propose to distribute incentives based on fees (yield and swap fees) generated over the previous two weeks. Beethoven-X has developed a [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c) that details a pool's contribution to fees and the resulting incentive distribution those pools will receive. While distributing incentives based on TVL is a good approximation, using fees as the underlying data is more accurate.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following existing pools would be designated as core pools:\n\n* Rocket Fuel (reth/eth metastable)\n* Shanghai Shakedown (wsteth/eth metastable)\n* Tri-Sonne Harmonic Crescendo (bb-so-wbtc/bb-so-wsteth/bb-so-usdc weighted pool)\n* Gyroscope ECLP (wstETH/WETH)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n* For this BIP to become active, Aura must launch on Optimism, which is planned very soon.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nVia redirecting a portion of Balancer's protocol fees to voting incentives for veBAL / vlAURA voters, the net percentage of protocol fees flowing to the Balancer DAO treasury as well as Beethoven X DAO treasury will be reduced to 17.5%.\n\nWhile this reduces potential future treasury runway, it also has the potential to bootstrap the TVL of pools that contribute considerably to revenue. Paired with a cross-chain Balancer boost, Aura’s Liquidity mining boost, incentives, possible Aura OP matching, and potentially positive ROI on voting markets, yield-bearing core pools will have the potential to see a considerable increase in TVL. To add to this, these pools are unique in that an increase in TVL directly correlates to the revenue generated.",

        "author": "0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3",
        "body": "**Summary:**\n\nWith the upcoming launch of multiple products utilizing Managed Balancer Pools, Index Coop is proposing a partnership with Balancer DAO that includes fee split arrangements, a token swap, and veBAL gauges.\n\n**Supplemental Resources:**\n\n* Launch the [Diversified Staked ETH Index](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-launch-the-diversified-staked-eth-index-dseth/4389) (dsETH)\n* Fee Split Framework: [Index Coop / Balancer Fee Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K1_AyR0jBxa8_-3yk4FgeawDaCfMplH4VUd1YZ5-0pI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nSince launching over two years ago, Index Coop has established itself as the leader in on-chain structured products. With over 90% of the market share of on-chain indices, we’ve experienced first-hand the many trends and cycles of crypto. Much like the rest of DeFi, Index Coop has yet to reach escape velocity. Our current slate of products offer users one-click access to the largest sectors of crypto. Our strategies make DeFi simple for users who don’t want to constantly manage on-chain positions.\n\nOur DAO, however, has been limited in the type of products we can build. Our upcoming suite of products, built and bundled on Managed Balancer Pools, will unlock the advancements and efficiencies of DeFi in a whole new way. In our new partnership, Index and Balancer are positioned to bring the wonders of crypto to all users. The Index Coop team aims to bring Balancer to every corner of the finance world including institutional custodians, TradFi data providers, crypto intermediaries, DeFi money markets, on-chain aggregators, and wallet interfaces. It is time to bring Balancer to the mainstream.\n\nIn an effort to keep our partnership strong and long-term focused - with both of our communities in mind - Index Coop is proposing:\n\n1. Product fee splits\n2. OTC token swap\n3. Enable veBAL gauges on select products\n\n**Product fee splits**\n\n* Index Coop is offering Balancer DAO a base of 30% of MBP-level fees for Composite MBPs. For Structured MBPs a base MBP-level fee of 50% will go to Balancer.\n  * Composite MBPs will resemble existing composite, Set-based products like DPI. Composite MBPs will typically target a theme, sector, or market and generally have simpler functionality.\n  * Structured MBPs will represent a new class of products that utilize the fuller feature set of Managed Pools. These structured MBPs will include tokens built in-house by Index Coop and will generally have more sophisticated functionality compared to Composite MBPs.\n    * Upcoming dsETH will be considered a Structured MBP\n* For a full deep dive into the fee arrangements follow this link: [Index Coop / Balancer Fee Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K1_AyR0jBxa8_-3yk4FgeawDaCfMplH4VUd1YZ5-0pI/edit?usp=sharing)\n* Most Favored Nation status: For any fee split arrangement Balancer gives to any party in the future, Index Coop shall have the right (but not the obligation) to receive the same terms.\n\n**Token Swap**\n\n* Index Coop is proposing a 1:1 OTC treasury swap\n* 100k INDEX ([currently ~$200k](https://etherscan.io/token/0x0954906da0Bf32d5479e25f46056d22f08464cab)) for a proportional amount of BAL (a 30dma of each token to be applied upon date of formal agreement)\n* Index Coop will convert the tokens into veBAL using the vested escrow contract, locking them for 1 year\n* We believe in a long-term partnership and propose locking the respective veBAL and INDEX for at least 1 year\n* Index Coop will use these tokens to direct BAL rewards to Index Coop Managed Pools beginning with dsETH. These tokens will be supplemented by ~4,824 veBAL (~$80k) obtained by Index Coop treasury investments into the Balancer Boosted USD Pool.\n* Voting power for INDEX and BAL is planned to be instant, but is contingent on the technical capaiblites of the locking mechanism\n\n**veBAL Gauges**\n\n* Index Coop is proposing to set up initial gauges for the Diversified Staked ETH Index, Diversified Stable Yield Index, and future Structured MBPs\n\nOver the past few months, we’ve been inspired by the success of BAL and veBAL. We’ve already seen with dsETH how our products could bring positive sum dynamics as protocols can add native token incentives to our products and buy/lock veBAL. The Index Coop team intends to be a major advocate for protocols getting into the veBAL game. While the INDEX token does not share these same characteristics, the INDEX token has unique and powerful metagovernance dynamics. Considering the success of the [Aave swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-strategic-partnership-with-aave-dao/3031), this partnership would add voting power at a low cost there and also gain voting power in UNI, COMP, and others that we’ve used and can continue to use for asset listings. In addition to the metagovernace power, we invite Balancer DAO to use INDEX tokens to influence the direction of product decisions including the composition of future MBPs.\n\nIndex Coop’s first managed pool, dsETH, is only the beginning. Our product team is looking forward to increased flexibility as we build future indices and even as we think about redesigning or bundling existing indices. We believe the combination of our technical teams and our added abilities to distribute tokens to custodians and possibly centralized exchanges will open up Balancer to a whole new class of investors.\n\n**Voting Specifications:**\n\nWe request a vote to decide on the partnership between Index Coop and Balancer DAO.\n\nIf the community votes YES:\n\n* The product fee arrangement as specified above will be put into place\n* Index Coop and Balancer DAO will conduct an OTC token swap. BAL will be sent to the Index Coop Treasury Account: 0x462A63D4405A6462b157341A78Fd1baBfD3F8065\n* Initial gauges will be set up for dsETH and DYI\n\nIf the community votes NO:\n\n* Index Coop and Balancer teams will revisit our partnership framework without interfering with the technical development of the products\n\nIndex Coop and Balancer will continue to work closely together as we build our future slate of products. We look forward to hearing from the entire Balancer Community and we’re happy to answer any questions!",
