The pool aims to enhance liquidity and yield opportunities for AURA holders while supporting kai’s mission of amplified DeFi rewards.\n\n---\n\n## **Pool Details**\n- **Pool:** [Liquidity Pool (v2): kaiAURA / AURA](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x62e57e37e3185871c13a422a363293780d17305b0002000000000000000006d3)  \n- **Pool Contract:** `0x62e57e37e3185871c13a422a363293780d17305b`  \n- **Gauge Address (Ethereum):** `0x4fd03b8c15e70e6b3413e4d2ff3825a19746e78b`\n\n---\n\n## **References/Useful Links**\n- **Website:** [kaiAura.finance](https://kaiAura.finance)  \n- **Documentation:** [kai Docs](https://docs.kaiaura.finance/)  \n- **Communities:** [X](https://twitter.com/kai_finance_)  \n- **Dapp:** [app.kaiAura.finance](https://app.kaiAura.finance)  \n- **Dune Dashboard:** [kaiAURA Analytics](https://dune.com/kaiauradao/kai)\n\n---\n\n## **Protocol Description**\n- **AURA:** The governance token of Aura Finance, designed to maximize rewards for liquidity providers and veBAL stakers. AURA holders can lock tokens into vlAURA to earn rewards and participate in governance.  \n- **kaiAURA:** A tokenized wrapper of AURA created by kai to amplify staking rewards. Staked kaiAURA receives enhanced yield opportunities.\n\n**kai DAO** is a DeFi protocol designed to optimize and amplify rewards for AURA stakers. By converting AURA into kaiAURA, users access enhanced yield opportunities, including real-time USDC payouts, additional rewards (e.g., Aura, Pal, WETH), and governance participation via the $KAI token. Shortly after launch, kai achieved a position as a top 27 vlAura holder with over $440k TVL, demonstrating significant community interest and growth potential.\n\n---\n\n## **Motivation**\nThe **kaiAURA / AURA gauge** is strategically important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Voting Incentives:** kai has allocated 15,000 USDC for bribe emissions over the first three months for Paladin Quest voting. If the community allocates this, kai could become one of the top 8 apps for historical voting incentives.  \n2. **Support AURA Holders:** This pool offers AURA holders access to kai’s amplified yield opportunities, including real-time rewards, governance utility, and new staking options.  \n3. **Strengthen Balancer Liquidity:** Pairing kaiAURA with AURA increases Balancer’s TVL and trading volume, generating additional fees for the protocol treasury.  \n4. **Boost Ecosystem Collaboration:** Balancer benefits from kai’s integrations, improving liquidity efficiency and attracting new users.  \n5. **Enable Sustainable Growth:** Encourages broader adoption of kaiAURA and AURA, fostering a virtuous cycle of increased liquidity, yield, and governance participation.\n\nThis proposal benefits all stakeholders by strengthening interconnected ecosystems, enhancing liquidity, and maximizing yield opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n### **Governance**\n- Governed by kai DAO with community-driven initiatives.  \n- **kaiDAO Address:** [0x4696b1123f4c6a03711e2c6e8311350b0350d7c2](https://debank.com/profile/0x4696b1123f4c6a03711e2c6e8311350b0350d7c2)\n\n### **Oracles**\n- No external oracles are required.\n\n### **Audits**\n- **Open Source Code:** [GitHub](https://github.com/kai-aura/kai-Contracts)  \n- Currently unaudited, with plans for auditing in Phase III.  \n- Built on Aura contracts with minimal modifications to enhance user rewards.\n\n### **Centralization Vectors**\n- Non-custodial and decentralized, with strong community engagement and collaboration with ecosystem partners.  \n- Three early contributors and a total of seven contributors.\n\n### **Market History**\n- **Staking Rewards:** kaiAURA stakers earn 2x the rewards of typical vlAura holders due to liquidity incentives and yield dynamics.  \n- **Peg Management:** The pool uses a volatile structure to maintain peg stability, avoiding issues associated with stable swap pools.\n\n---\n\n## **Value Proposition**\n\nThe existence of kaiAura benefits the ecosystem in several ways. Users have additional functionality with Aura. Firstly, A user can convert Aura to kaiAura either 1:1 or (sometimes) market swap in for additional kaiAura and stake for amplified rewards, as not all kaiAura is staked. Also, additional Pal rewards because kai has acquired pal to stake for “Loot” from Paladin ecosystem partner. Plus kai emissions; Plus no lock-up, Plus no fees! As a liquidity provider of kaiAura-Aura a user gets the same price exposure (pure Aura price action) but yield is in the form of swap fees, gauge rewards, and kai emissions.\n\nThe **kaiAURA / AURA pool** benefits the ecosystem in several ways:\n\n- **Liquidity Hub:** Serves as a key trading and liquidity center for AURA and kaiAURA.  \n- **Protocol Revenue:** Increases Balancer’s income via trading fees and liquidity mining.  \n- **User Rewards:** Combines AURA price exposure with swap fees, gauge rewards, and kai emissions.  \n- **Ecosystem Growth:** Strengthens DeFi collaboration and attracts new participants.\n\nBy combining **kai’s innovative yield strategies**, **Aura’s governance framework**, and **Balancer’s robust infrastructure**, this pool marks a significant advancement in DeFi liquidity management.\n\n---\n\n## **Special Note**\nThe pool is a standard Balancer v2 pool with customizable fees. Initially, the fee is set at 1%, with the potential for adjustments to facilitate swap volume.\n\n---\n\n## **Gauge Details**\n- **Gauge Address:** `0x4fd03b8c15e70e6b3413e4d2ff3825a19746e78b`  \n- **Gauge Type:** Ethereum  \n\nWe invite the Balancer community to review and support this proposal. Feedback and discussions are welcome to refine and enhance this submission. Thank you!",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/537\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDiscord: overnight-fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time. Our token has a cross-chain functionality with the help of Axelar.\n>\n>\n> Launch Price: $20\n> Presale Price: $20\n> OVN Tokenomics: [Overnight Tokenomics ($OVN)](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/overnight-tokenomics)\n> Presale Information: [Overnight Presale Information](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/ovn-presale)\n> 25% of OVN from Private Presale unlocked on Oct 2. and the remaining 75 will be linearly vested for 4 weeks.\n>\n>  Additional Information:\n> - We cancelled public presale and just used the money raised from private presale to bootstrap liquidity on DEXes. \n> - We have launched at 20m FDV.\n> - We are already live on Aerodrome and Velodrome Finance. We also incentivized huge amount of bribes on Aerodrome (7400$) and Velodrome ($5,700) (For Sept. 28 - Oct. 5)\n> - We have also provided 22.5k OP for our Beefy Boost Program that will be distributed in over 2 weeks.\n> \n> - The rate providers was also reviewed by the integrations team and deemed safe.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n> \n> We aim to create a competitive environment that rewards participation and ensures the most efficient allocation of resources. We believe that veBAL voters are sophisticated and discerning and they will prioritize the community’s best interest. Complexity is often a byproduct of innovation. Our past experiences teach us valuable lessons, enabling us to build more robust systems.\n> \n> While 80/20 pools have been associated with locking, the beauty of the DeFi space is its adaptability. Our objective is to leverage the pool structure for its inherent benefits, not merely conform to traditional use-cases. The goal is to amplify liquidity and ensure stability, rather than exploit emissions. We’re using the pool to its fullest potential to cater to the evolving needs of the market. As also noted, the proposed bribe per week represents a significant boost in Aura’s bribe market, should all bribes be channeled in here.\n> \n> The absence of a defined market cap or trading history doesn’t undermine the intrinsic value of the coin or its future adoption potential. The proposed gauge allocation, especially the 2% caps, is informed by a forward-looking strategy, ensuring that it aligns with the expected bribes and accrued yield.\n> \n> The gauge allocation is in recognition of the potential this new coin brings. Traditional metrics, like trading history, might not fully capture the inherent value and projected adoption. We’re operating in a rapidly evolving landscape; hence, a forward-looking approach is crucial. Coingecko’s preview status doesn’t reflect the groundwork and strategic partnerships that underscore this project.\n> \n> The proposal aims to push the boundaries, capitalize on new opportunities, and ensure the best outcome for the community. We trust the veBAL voters to recognize the merit and long-term vision of this initiative.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/519\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?

        "body": "[PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/128)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the newly created unshETH 50/50 USH/ETH pool on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nunshETH’s governance token, USH, has launched on both BNB and Ethereum mainnet. The initial liquidity mining program will end on April 5th. The unshETH team plans to conduct the next liquidity mining program on Balancer, and to expand the collaboration between unshETH and Balancer even further in the future. Moreover, unshETH is integrated with an ecosystem partner, Stargate, that will enable scaling of its liquidity.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\nWebsite - [https://unshETH.xyz/](https://unsheth.xyz/)\n\nDocumentation - [https://docs.unshETH.xyz/](https://docs.unsheth.xyz/)\n\nGithub Page - [https://github.com/unshETH](https://github.com/UnshETH)\n\nCommunities - https://discord.com/invite/5tZXASh5P3\n\n**Other useful links?**\n\nTwitter - [https://twitter.com/unshETH_xyz](https://twitter.com/unsheth_xyz)\n\nBlog - https://mirror.xyz/0x749Dc728A68265e74754Ad8e6cc2649BD42a8f8a\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nunshETH is a decentralized, on-chain movement for improving validator decentralization. The Matrix prevents monopolies from growing so large that they stifle innovation and endanger the cryptocurrency economy by morphing into a central point of failure via the creation and enforcement of anti-competitive policies and practices.\n\nWithin Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, user activities are governed not by laws, but by protocol design and incentives. unshETH's mission is simple — decentralization through incentivization. Through incentive engineering, unshETH aims to distribute capital across the LSD ecosystem in a manner that prioritizes validator decentralization, and therefore the increased safety of the network.\n\nunshETH aims to be a catalyst for LSDfi. LSDfi refers to a new class of DeFi primitives that are built on top of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) in order to enable markets on staking yields, validator monopolies, slashing risks, and even validator censorship.\n\nLSDfi enables use cases such as validator decentralization mining, validator dominance options, interest rate swaps, yield speculation, and efficient risk pricing. These mechanisms allow users to take advantage of the unique properties of liquid staking derivatives, and can similarly be used to improve healthy competition among validators and restrict capture of the consensus layer.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nunshETH aims to be one of the first protocols to usher in LSDfi. Adding this gauge will allow for USH to have deep, robust liquidity on Balancer markets on any chain. This proposal represents the first step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity on Ethereum mainnet - with future considerations for other EVM and Layer 0 compatible chains.\n\nTo achieve this, unshETH intends to begin its second liquidity mining incentives campaign (~1M USH) to veBAL/vlAURA markets. Once this amount has been emitted unshETH will consider future incentives after evaluating the performance of the gauge and depending on future protocol developments.\n\n\n**Details:**\n\nGovernance: unshETH’s governance structures for USH token holders will be launched by the end of April 2023\n\nOracles: No on-chain price feed oracles exist for the USH token at this time.\n\nOmnichain: The USH token is an omnifungible (OFT-20) token.\n\nAudits: Certik Audits of unshETH V1 and V2: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/unsheth\n](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/unsheth)\n\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n\nThe unshETH protocol is in the process of rapidly and iteratively decentralizing the protocol, in keeping with the project’s dedication to the ideology and practice of maximally decentralized finance.\n\nWith the launch of unshETH protocol V2, on April 1st, 2023, ownership by the team multisig was fully renounced and any changes affecting user-deposited funds are governed by a 72-hour timelock. Prior to this protocol upgrade there was a centralization risk of the team-controlled multi-sig being able to change oracles and approved minters.\n\nThe deployment of unshETH protocol V2 also launches configurable target weights and risk caps on the user-deposited LSD tokens underlying the unsETH token; currently target weights are set at a fair equal split across Liquid Staking ETH tokens issued by protocols chosen by the team based for their market-leadership. The unshETH team’s ability to set those target weights is a centralization risk that will be mitigated with the launch of the DAO governance structures, which the team is targeting to launch by the end of April 2023.\n\nThe launch of DAO governance and the transition to a ve-style token staking model (called vdUSH) that will empower the USH token holding community to govern protocol parameters such as the target weights.\n\n\n**Market History:** \n\nThe USH token was launched on 1/31/2023. Protocol development was not funded with any outside capital, including that of VC’s or angels. The launch was accomplished via an airdrop, announced on the unshETH blog (https://mirror.xyz/0x749Dc728A68265e74754Ad8e6cc2649BD42a8f8a/1idxwRQ3kdkXGEpmwO_IKiFTC2JgPYdWr6RdlRleTGo) to:\n\n* Early adopters of the old guard of liquid staking\n* Liquid staking pioneers who've been using LSDfi for leverage\n* The savviest yield-seekers this side of L1 (LSD-ETH LP farmers)\n* Team and early contributors\n\nThe airdrop was followed by an initial staking and liquidity mining campaign.\n\n\n**Value:** \nThis pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity for USH on Ethereum. This gauge is the first step in building a deep collaboration with the Balancer ecosystem and community that will create value for all stakeholders. Balancer and the ecosystem of partners that Balancer has created will be a key part of the growth of unsETH protocol into the market-leader in the nascent LSDfi category.\n\n$USH trading metrics as of 04/03/2023 (Sushiswap: https://app.sushi.com/analytics/pools/0xaaf448d30f01b429fb6e7f9af6a8ff66e694f312?chainId=1):\n\n* Volume (24h) - $2,529,182\n* Fees (24h) - $7,588\n* Utilization (24h) - 106%\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n**Gauge Weight Cap**\nunshETH proposes to cap the gauge emissions to 10%. The current intention of this pool is to allow collected fees to be paid back into the gauge via Core Pool Bribes.\n\nunshETH may return to governance at a later date to request an increase as the need arises and the pool has more history to be used to evaluate it against BIP-57.\n\n\n**Gauge Type**\nNote that this gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80/20 program. As a result BAL incentives will be paid out to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge. Not to a single smart contract that redirects these tokens to lockers.\n\n\n**Core Pools Designation:**\nWhile this pool contains no boosted tokens, a 0.5% fee has been set on the pool with an intention to participate in the BIP-19 boosted pool program. As with RBN/USDC gauge, It is therefore requested that 100% of the fees earned by this pool and not paid to the DAO are used to pay bribes on the pool. It is further requested that these fees are used bribe the USH/ETH pool directly, instead of participating in the distribution of bribes by TVL as following the protocol for mainnet instead of for side-chains specified in BIP-19. Handling of this pool should change in line with changes to BIP-19.\n\n\n**Details of Gauge to be whitelisted**\nGauge address: [0xCd8bB8cEBc794842967849255C234e7b7619A518](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCd8bB8cEBc794842967849255C234e7b7619A518#code)\nPool address: [0xeabaf850fd494c5661ba15ea5307c11d5307d0e2](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xeabaf850fd494c5661ba15ea5307c11d5307d0e2/about)\n\nThe specific actions of authorizing the DAO multisig, adding the gauge, and removing the authorization using the gauge address above are included in the linked payload.\n\nAuthor\nHarpe is an independent contributor to the unshETH protocol, pursuing growth of the unshETH protocol through collaboration with other DeFi teams and DAOs.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/846\n\n**Summary:**\n> This is a proposal to enable Balancer Gauge for SYNO/wETH 80/20 pool on Arbitrum.\nSynonym Finance launched in February of 2024, achieved a TVL in the protocol of $10M+ and achieved a liquidity of $1M+ in the governance token pool 80SYNO-20WETH on Balancer on Arbitrum. SYNO serves as a governance token for Synonym Finance. Much like many protocols in the DeFI space, providing liquidity on Balancer and locking it on the Synonym Dapp provides users with a boost towards emissions as well as share of fees. WIth the introduction of the Gauge, BAL/AURA emissions will now further fuel the incentive for liquidity provision, amplifying the pool’s attractiveness and increasing the size of the pool even further. \n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\nWebsite: https://www.synonym.finance/\nDocumentation: Docs: https://synonym-finance.gitbook.io/synonym-finance/documentation/overview \nGithub Page: https://github.com/SynonymFinance\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/synonymfinance\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/synonymfinance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Synonym Finance is a universal cross-chain money market built for busy DeFi Professionals. Users can lend, borrow and earn rewards across multiple chains without leaving our unified UI. Synonym is a truly cross-chain application powered by the Wormhole xChain technology stack and further enhanced by Circle CCTP. The goal of Synonym is to unify and take advantage of the liquidity fragmented across various chains. Synonym Finance launched on Arbitrum, Ethereum and Optimism Chains. \n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> SYNO/wETH pool is highly important to Synonym as this pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity on Arbitrum. Additionally, users are incentivized to provide liquidity into this pool as they will be eligible for a boost towards $SYNO emissions as well as share of the revenue. This kicks off a flow where users get emissions - lock liquidity and get even more emissions. The proposed gauge will give the chance to incentivize even higher rewards for the pool, thus increasing the liquidity of SYNO token.\nThe current sustainable yield for providing liquidity to the pool is around 15%. We expect to significantly increase the APR with enabling Balancer Gauge, via Aura in future. After that, the pool would naturally grow and attract even further user base into the ecosystem. Additionally, we expect to facilitate even further incentivization with Aura or alternatively Hidden Hand, our partners through a connection via Redacted Finance.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Synonym Finance governance’s structure is provided [here](https://synonym-finance.gitbook.io/synonym-finance/documentation/governance).   \n\n2. **Oracles:** Synonym Finance relies on Pyth Price Oracles.\n\n\n3. **Audits:** Synonym Finance has been audited twice: by Runtime Verification and Ottersec. You can find audits [here](https://synonym-finance.gitbook.io/developer-docs/audits).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Due to our experience in the space, our governance is set in a decentralized manner and we are further looking to decentralize it even further. Forum - [here](https://forum.synonym.finance/overview). Due to the recent launch, the governance process is yet to be kicked off. The DAO is governed by the multisigs on Arbitrum and Ethereum. The smart contracts are verified, and any community member may propose changes or Improvements. There have already been proposals from the active members of the community. All contracts are available in the docs and are easily observed by members of the community.\n\n5. **Market History:** Synonym Finance launched on 6th of February 2024. We have launched after a merger with New Order DAO and an additional raise of $1.5M from investors led by Borderless Capital. We have reached a TVL of $13M and now are expanding into new assets & chains. $SYNO has launched on the same date. Coingecko [link](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synonym-finance).

In addition, the Synonym DAO sees a huge value of this gauge in growing the total liquidity locked in the pool to $10M+.\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x26634a2B85831D9916D01Fa6c2489F9c5720600a](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x26634a2B85831D9916D01Fa6c2489F9c5720600a#readContract)\nRoot gauge w/ 2% cap: [0xB9bB09ADCBcaE06F580DA494EE6987dbB083b45f](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB9bB09ADCBcaE06F580DA494EE6987dbB083b45f#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xB9bB09ADCBcaE06F580DA494EE6987dbB083b45f`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
