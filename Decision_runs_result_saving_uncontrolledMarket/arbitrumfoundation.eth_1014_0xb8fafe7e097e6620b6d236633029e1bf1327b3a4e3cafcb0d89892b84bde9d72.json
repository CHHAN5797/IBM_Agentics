Balancer is the second-largest DEX by TVL on Arbitrum, contributing to ecosystem growth and liquidity depth, especially for LST and innovative AMM designs. Despite some community concerns about efficiency and grant size, Balancer has reduced its ask from 1.6M to 1.2M ARB and demonstrated responsiveness to feedback. The majority of forum sentiment supports the proposal, highlighting Balancer's professionalism and ecosystem role.",
