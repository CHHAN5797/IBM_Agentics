As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.\n\nWith the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.\n\nBased upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates. \n\n## Non Frozen Assets\n\nFor non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d) has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.\n\nThe Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal. \n\nAs utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC. \n\nUpon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3. \n\nAssets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.\n\n## Frozen Assets\n\nEach frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.\n\nAssets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated as follows:\n\n| Asset | Current Slope1 | Proposed Slope1 | Current Uoptimal | Proposed Uoptimal | Current Slope2 | Proposed Slope2 |\n| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   |\n| BAL   | 27.00% | 50.00% | 65.00% | 20.00% | 236.00% | 500.00% |\n| CRV   | 17.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 392.00% | 500.00% |\n| DAI   | 12.00% | 12.75% | 71.00% | 71.00% | 105.00% |   200.00% |\n| GHST  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 23.00% | 10.00% | 413.00% | 500.00% |\n| LINK  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 402.00% | 500.00% |\n| USDT  | 12.00% | 12.75% | 52.00% | 52.00% | 236.00% |   236.00% |\n| wBTC  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 37.00% | 37.00% | 536.00% |   536.00% |\n| wETH  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 40.00% | 40.00% | 167.00% |   200.00% |\n| wMATIC|  6.00% |  6.75% | 48.00% | 48.00% | 440.00% |   500.00% |\n| wUSDC | 12.00% | 12.75% | 77.00% | 77.00% | 134.00% |   200.00% |\n\nSubject to approval from @ChaosLabs, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n4) Review, and where applicable, submit an AIP every 2 weeks\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

To accommodate this demand and facilitate protocol growth, this proposal suggests increasing the supply cap of weETH on the Ethereum pool and the borrow cap at 35% of the new supply cap amount. This proposal also aims at changing the interestRate Strategy to place the optimal ratio at 35% of liquidity.\n\nExpanding borrow capacity will result in a higher collateral yield, which in turn creates a positive flywheel effect on supply and demand. By maintaining the borrow cap at an optimal ratio (35%) of the supply cap, we can balance risk, available liquidity, and LP yield effectively.\n\nWe also propose to increase weETH RF to 45% to contribute to Aave DAO revenue.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Chain     | Asset        | Current Supply Cap  | Recommended New Supply Cap | Current Borrow Cap   | Recommended New Borrow Cap |\n| ---       | ---          | ---                 | ---                         | ---                 | ---                           |\n| Ethereum  | weETH       | 16,000             | 84,000                     | 800                | 29500                        |\n\n| Chain     | Asset        | Current Optimal ratio  | Recommended optimal ratio | Current reserve factor   | Recommended New reserve factor |\n| ---       | ---          | ---                 | ---                         | ---                 | ---                           |\n| Ethereum  | weETH       | 45%            | 35%                 | 15%               |             45%           |\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather consensus from the community and risk service providers.\n2. Escalate to ARFC Snapshot vote stage.\n3. If the Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage for formal implementation.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal has been created independently by the ACI without external compensation or incentives.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC]  GHO Parameter Adjustment - Governance Process Amendment\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic @ACI \ncreated: 2024-06-04\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes that upon deploying GHO to a new network, several GHO parameters are included within the Direct-to-AIP process and implemented by either AIP or Steward role.\n\n# Motivation\n\nGHO was successfully launched on Arbitrum with two additional facilitator bucket capacity increases pre-approved. While these two capacity increases fall under the Direct-to-AIP process, other future increases are not pre-approved and follow the ARFC process.\n\nTo facilitate the streamlining of GHO adoption on Arbitrum and other deployments beyond Ethereum, this publication proposes adjusting the following parameters to be included within the Direct-to-AIP process. \n\n* GHO Reserve Borrow Rate\n* CCIP Bridge\n* GHO Stability Module(s)\n* GHO Reserve funded exclusively from new facilitator on Ethereum\n\nThe Direct-to-AIP governance process enables the DAO to implement upgrades faster and more closely track market conditions. AIP votes will still be required until such time as the GHO Steward role is fully extended to support the new parameter adjustments not currently covered by the Risk Steward role.\n\nFor clarification, the following parameter adjustments are to continue following the ARFC process:\n\n* Safety Module emission rates\n* New GHO deployments\n* GHO Reserve Factor\n\nNote, risk parameters such as Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and the ability to freeze a reserve are already approved as Direct-to-AIP with the implementation performed by the Risk Steward role.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis publication grants approval to adjust the following GHO related parameters via the Direct-to-AIP process.\n\n* GHO Reserve Borrow Rate\n* CCIP Bridge\n* GHO Stability Module(s)\n* GHO Reserve funded exclusively from new facilitator on Ethereum\n\nThis proposal covers the recent GHO on Arbitrum deployment and also, future GHO deployments beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will be submitted to implement the proposed upgrade.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] GHO - Increase Borrow Rate\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & ACI - @MarcZeller\ncreated: 2023-10-30\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes increasing the GHO Borrow Rate from 3.00% to 4.72%, the proposed sDAI rate.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past week, the GHO peg has been gradually declining, while the supply has been increasing. Users have been minting GHO and subsequently exchanging it for other assets.\n\nIncremental interest rate hikes have not had the desired effect, evident by GHO price continuing to trade lower. The GHO borrowing rate remains significantly lower compared to other stablecoins.\n\nThis publication suggests aligning the GHO borrowing rate with the proposed sDAI rate, 4.72%. The aim is to reduce the borrowing discount of GHO relative to other stablecoins before returning to periodic 50bps increases.\n\nThe chart below shows the general GHO price downwards trend. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByIPGWaz6.png)\n\nThe below shows the borrow rate of GHO relative to other stable coins. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryZgQWazp.png)\n\nThe main types of collateral backing GHO are wstETH (29.68%), wETH (28.84%), wBTC (20.44%) and rETH (8.94%). For reference, sDAI makes up 2.07% of the collateral supporting GHO debt with a current APR of [5.0%](https://daistats.com/#/ecosystem) which is expected to adjust lower to 4.72%. A large portion of the collateral backing GHO is generating yield which acts to offset borrowing costs.\n\nBy increasing the borrow rate to 4.72%, the goal is to improve the peg by reducing the incentive to mint GHO relative to other stable coins. As a result, GHO's growth is expected to slow. This publication prioritises returning GHO to peg over growth. \n\nAfter implementing this proposal, the community can continue with the current plan, [direct-to-AIP process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/349/). \n\n# Specification\n\nAsset: GHO\nContract Address: [0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f)\nCurrent Borrow Rate: [3.00%](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1255fC8DC8E76761995aCF544eea54f1B7fB0459#readContract)\nProposed Borrow Rate: 4.72%\nNew discounted Borrow Rate: ~3.31%\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\nThe Aave Facilitator Bucket Level is to remain at 35.00M units\n\nThe AIP will be submitted by @marcZeller and the ACI team.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2) In 5 days scalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage.\n3) If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] wMATIC Interest Rate Update\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & @defijesus \ncreated: 2023-11-02\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes revising the wMATIC interest rate from 6.10% to 5.00% Aave v3 Polygon.\n\n# Motivation\n\nFollowing on from previous discussions to reduce the wMATIC interest rate, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-interest-rate-recommendations-for-weth-and-wmatic-on-v2-and-v3/14588). This publication proposes reducing the Slope1 parameter from 6.10% to 5.00%. The 5.00% Slope1 parameter marginally exceeds the the current borrow rate and the two dominants LST APRs.\n\nv3 wMATIC Borrow Rate: [4.74% APY](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3) (at time of writing)\nMaticX APR: [4.68%](https://www.staderlabs.com/polygon/stake/)\nstMATIC APR: [4.30%](https://lido.fi/)\n\nWith the current borrowing rate for wMATIC, 4.74% APY, it exceeds the LST yield. As a result, users are not generating a positive return on looping the LST and wMATIC. Reducing the Slope1 to 5.00%, keeping utilisation constant, the borrow rate APY is reduced to 3.87%. At this level, the yield maximising strategy become profitable. Reducing the Slope1 parameter is the most effective way to stimulate wMATIC borrowing demand.\n\nLowering the Slope1 parameter will increase the utilisation of the wMATIC reserve. The new equilibrium scenarios are shown below:\n\n* Borrow rate 4.30% supports utilisation of 63.10%\n* Borrow rate 4.68% supports utilisation of 68.55%\n* Borrow rate 4.74% supports utilisation of 69.50%\n\nFor each equilibrium scenario above, the Aave DAO's revenue increases. \n\nReducing the Slope1 to 5.00%, keeping utilisation constant, the deposit rate falls to 1.74% on v3. This compares favourably to the 0.53% deposit rate on v2. As a result, we do not expect to see any migration from v3 to v2 and propose no changes to the v2 wMATIC interest rate strategy.\n\n# Specification\n\nUpdate the interest rate strategy as per below:\n\nwMATIC Address: [`0x0d500B1d8E8eF31E21C99d1Db9A6444d3ADf1270`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270)\n\nvariableRateSlope1: From 6.10% to 5.00%\n\nAll other parameters remain the same as the [existing interest rate strategy](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xFB0898dCFb69DF9E01DBE625A5988D6542e5BdC5#code).\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.
