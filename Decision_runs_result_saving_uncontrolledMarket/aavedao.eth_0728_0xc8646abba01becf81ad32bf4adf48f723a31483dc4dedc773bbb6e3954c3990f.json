        "body": "---\naip: <to be assigned>\ntitle: Add stETH to Aave V2\nstatus: ARC posted, pending snapshot vote\nauthor: Jbeezy (@jbeezy1)\nshortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for stETH\nARC discussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-steth-lido/5793/6\ncreated: 2021-10-18\nupdated: N/A\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nLido allows users to earn staking rewards on the Ethereum beacon chain without locking Ether or maintaining staking infrastructure. This is done through the stETH token. stETH tokens represent a tokenized staking deposit and can be held, traded, or sold.\n\nFull ARC and discussion can be viewed here: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-steth-lido/5793\n\nProposed voting choices:\n1. Yes: Add stETH as proposed (no borrowing)\n2. No: Do not add stETH\n\n## Abstract\n\nThere is strong interest in using stETH to earn additional yield without taking a lot of risk. This is evident through the growth of the stETH/ETH pool on Curve Finance, which has become the most liquid pool on Curve with a liquidity of $3.8 billion.\n\nThe addition of stETH on to Aave can work to attract a larger audience to both Aave and Lido. More ETH staked with Lido would subsequently benefit the decentralization and security of the Ethereum network, to the benefit of the community as a whole. stETH would likely bring new borrow demand to Aave as market participants look to borrow against their staked ETH or lend their stETH for a yield.\n\nWe want people who want to be responsibly long ETH (i.e. via taking leverage on AAVE) to be able to put some extra staking rewards on top.\n\n## Motivation\n\nstETH as DeFi collateral is beneficial for a number of reasons:\n\n- stETH is almost as safe as ETH, price-wise: barring catastrophic scenarios, its value tends to hold the ETH peg well;\n- stETH is a productive asset. Earning rewards on collateral effectively lowers the cost of borrowing. This could make borrowing more attractive on Aave and help to increase market utilization (and therefore Aave’s protocol revenue from stablecoin reserve factors).\n- stETH is a very liquid asset with over $3.8 billion in liquidity locked in the Curve stETH/ETH pool.\n\n## Proposed Risk Parameters\nThese have been modified since the last proposal. The reasons are described below. Generally, the functions of stETH have held consistent during growth and market volatility.\n\nLTV: 70%\nLiquidation Threshold: 75%\nLiquidation Bonus: 7.5%\nReserve Factor: 10%\n\nA LTV of 70% is higher than the 56% average LTV across non-stablecoin assets and 10% lower than ETH’s 80% LTV. This gives the protocol more room to safely liquidate stETH with a volatility profile similar to ETH.\n\nInterest Rate Model (we plan to not have stETH borrowing available initially):\n\nUOptimal: 60%\nBase: 0%\nSlope 1: 8%\nSlope 2: 200%\n\nAs stETH is more suited as collateral instead of a borrowing asset we adjusted the utilization rate to 60% and doubled slope 2 in order to safe guard enough liquidity in the event of market consolidation and liquidation events.\n\nstETH liquidity and risk considerations\n\n- stETH inherits all of ETH’s market risk, so they should be considered together for the purpose of evaluating market risk\n- stETH value is defined and backed by the value of Ether and expectations on the beacon chain withdrawals timeline. As the expected merge gets closer, stETH risk will drop down significantly.\n- stETH is one of the most liquid tokens in crypto with low exchange volumes and extremely high liquidity\n- stETH liquidity is ensured by Lido’s strategy incentivizing a consistent stETH peg\n\n## References\n- [Website](https://lido.fi/)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/lidofinance)\n- [Whitepaper](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/README.md)\n- [stETH Contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84)\n- [wstETH Contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0)\n- [Blog](https://blog.lido.fi/)\n- [Primer](https://lido.fi/static/Lido:Ethereum-Liquid-Staking.pdf)\n- [Audits](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits)\n- [Lido Forum](https://research.lido.fi/)\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vgdPfhZ)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LidoFinance)\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Harmony is an open and fast blockchain that is fully Ethereum compatible with 2-second transaction finality and near-zero fees. \n\nHarmony invites the Aave community to support this launch by participating in the Aave contracts deployment, enabling the Aave v2 front-end for Harmony markets, and adding Harmony in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.  \n\nHarmony will start by providing $5M USD in ONE tokens in incentives to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Harmony. \n\nWe specifically planned for a one year incentive campaign so that net new users have the opportunity to come into Aave and decentralized finance. We know that many protocols are giving out even higher incentives over a short period of time. We chose an attractive incentive over a longer period so that new users who may not be experienced power users can also benefit from the launch. \n\nIn addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support. \n\nOur overall goal is to use Harmony’s $300 million ecosystem fund for growing a deep base of 10,000 builders and 10 million users. \n\nMotivation\n\nAave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Harmony ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Sushi on Harmony and other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Harmony and will add net new users from Harmony’s 350,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Harmony. \n\nSpecifications\n\nProvide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nHarmony is a sharded proof-of-stake blockchain. It has processed more than 120M transactions on mainnet and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. Our secure bridges offer cross-chain asset transfers with Ethereum, Binance and 3 other chains.\n\nFor more details, read our documentation.\n\nMetrics\nover 18,010 delegators and 118 validators, staking 4.2 billion ONEs ($700m staked)\n$84 million TVL on Sushi on Harmony, and $30 million combined on other DEXes\n$91 million TVL on Harmony’s bridge to Ethereum and BSC \n3,200 creators and $1.6 million sales on DaVinci NFT marketplace\n100+ active apps; over 135,300 active wallets; over 120 million mainnet transactions\n\nAudience data\nTwitter: https://harmony.one/twitter (209K)\nReddit: https://harmony.one/reddit (29K) \nTelegram: https://harmony.one/telegram (27K)\nDiscord: https://harmony.one/discord (7K)\nMedium: https://harmony.one/medium (3.5K) \nFacebook: https://harmony.one/facebook (6.4K)\nYoutube: https://harmony.one/youtube (10.5K)\n\nReferences\nHomepage: https://www.harmony.one/  \nDocumentation: https://docs.harmony.one/home/ \nSource code: https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony \nAudits: https://harmony.one/audit and https://harmony.one/audit2 \nForum: https://talk.harmony.one/ \nCommunities: https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol \n\nIncentives\n\nHarmony will provide $5M USD in ONE tokens in incentives in the form of native ONE tokens for 1 year to bootstrap initial usage with the following emission schedule:\n\nMonths 1-3: 40%\nMonths 4-6: 30%\nMonths 7-9: 20%\nMonths 10-12: 10%\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nHarmony will deploy a fork of Aave v2 https://github.com/harmony-one/protocol-v2. We welcome feedback and support of the Aave core devs in deployment. Harmony supports Gnosis multisig, TheGraph subgraphs, Chainlink oracles to enable a fully functional Aave v2 market.  \n\nAfter the market is functional, we will work with the Aave core devs for cross-chain governance implementation on Aave v2 markets on Harmony. \n\nAuthor: Li Jiang (@lijiang2087)\nDiscussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-market-launch-on-harmony/5065",

The all-time high is around 2 DAI / GHST. GHST is priced in DAI because unlike most tokens in crypto, it is actually backed by a DAI reserve at a 33% connecting weight. This makes the price more stable because it takes more in/out to change the price. \n\nGHST was bridged to Polygon in January 2021, with more than 50% of its current total supply locked into the Polygon Bridge. It is well-distributed, with more than 17,000 holders and stakers on Ethereum and Polygon combined, and is very active, with more than 1.2 million transactions and an average volume of $50M on multiple top-tier CEXes and DEXes. \n\n## Use Cases within the AAVE Ecosystem\nGHST has many use cases which make it an excellent choice for being listed as an Aave collateral:\n* Staking in Aavegotchi Staking contracts, earning FRENS\n* Providing liquidity on DEXes\n* Participating in #BidToEarn Auctions, where getting outbid earns you GHST\n* Staking as collateral within Aavegotchi NFTs\n* Purchasing and trading Aavegotchi NFT assets \n\nGHST’s relatively low normalized volatility also makes it an excellent choice for a collateral for borrowing. \n\n## Risk Analysis:\n**GHST Overall Risk is: B**\n\n### Smart Contract Risk: B-\nMaturity: 333 Days (Deployed on 9/14/2020)\nTransactions: 1,274,683\n\n### Counterparty Risk: B+\nHolders: 17,018 (Ethereum: 5854, Polygon: 8481, Stakers: 2683)\nPermission: Permissionless \n\n### Market Risk:  B\n\nMarket Cap: 130,000,000 \nAverage Volume:  $50,408,294\nNormalized Volatility: 6%\n\n**Overall Risk Score: B**\n\n## Proposed Risk Parameters\nUnlike most asset applications, we would like to propose two separate Risk Parameter options and allow the community to vote on their favorite. \n\nOption 1 is more conservative and in line with collaterals on the Aave Ethereum Market, while Option 2 is more liberal and similar to other collaterals on the Aave Polygon Market. \n\nFinally, we offer an option to only use GHST for borrowing, and an option to decline the listing completely. \n\n### Risk Parameters Option 1\nLTV:  25%\nLiquidation Threshold: 45%\nLiquidation Bonus: 12.5%*\nReserve Factor: 20%\n\n### Risk Parameters Option 2\nLTV:  50%\nLiquidation Threshold: 65%\nLiquidation Bonus: 12.5%*\nReserve Factor: 20%\n\n*In their recent report, Gauntlet suggested using max 12.5% LB\n\n## Snapshot Choices\n* Choice A -- Do not list \n* Choice B -- Only Borrowing Asset\n* Choice C -- Risk Param Choice 1\n* Choice D -- Risk Param Choice 2\n\n## Full Disclosure\nStani Kulechov is an official advisor of Aavegotchi, and Aave has invested into Pixelcraft Studios, the development team behind Aavegotchi.\n\n# Thank you for your consideration!\n❤️ Aavegotchi Fam\n\n",

With the recent rebranding Matic has now expanded in scope and vision and have transformed into Polygon with the aim of becoming an L2 aggregator - thereby providing a developer with all L2 solutions - POS/Plasma chain (mainnet launched April 2020), zk and Optimistic Rollups and Validum chains.\nThe MATIC token lies at the heart of the Polygon ecosystem with multiple use-cases. Primarily the MATIC token is used for paying gas fees on the Polygon network. It runs the ecosystem, supporting top Dapps. Additionally you can participate in the Proof-of-Stake consensus of the blockchain as a validator node and earn 12-14% APY in MATIC tokens.\n\n\nPositioning of MATIC token within the AAVE ecosystem:\nMatic token is currently one of the most liquid altcoins on CEXs with daily spot volumes over 100M. The recent Coinbase listing was another achievement - further positioning MATIC as one of the premier altcoins.\n\nSecondly, the whole NFT/Gaming boom has definitely made dapps like Decentraland, Decentral Games, Aavegotchi, Cometh, Polymarket, Quickswap household names in the space.\n\n\nMATIC can play a unique role in the AAVE ecosystem in following ways -\nLending MATIC\nSince MATIC is primarily a CEX traded coin, most of the speculation and activity remains confined there. Holders don’t have an additional source of revenue other than price speculation. With MATIC as a collateral on AAVE, holders will rush to seek yields, in turn boosting AAVE’s liquidity.\nBorrow MATIC\nIn today’s high gas fees environment Ether is becoming scarcer by the day. DEX traders can depost Ether on Aave and can borrow Matic on lucrative interest rates. The borrowed Matic can be then provided in single pool dexes like Bancor on L1 and QuickSwap/ComethSwap on L2 to capture liquidity pools of a growing DeFi ecosystem on Polygon.\n\n\nRisk:\nMATIC’s Overall Risk is B+\nMATIC Smart Contract Risk: B\nMATIC Counterparty Risk: B+\nMATIC Market Risk: C\n\nRisk Parameters\nLTV 25%\nLiquidation Threshold 45%\nLiquidation Bonus 10%\nReserve Factor 20%\n\nContracts date of deployments - 20 April 2019\nNumber of transactions - 1,689,469\nNumber of holders for tokens - 136,013 (on-chain)\n",

        "body": "Discussion: \n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-deployment-to-bittorrent-chain-bttc/6813 \n\nSummary\n\nThe BitTorrent DAO Community asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into BitTorrent Chain (known as BTTC), which can expand lending to the BitTorrent community and, with the provision of incentives, bootstrap the launch of Aave on a new ecosystem.\n\nProposer\n\nBitTorrent Chain is an open-source, EVM-compatible blockchain that offers high concurrency, higher submission speed, lower transaction fees, and smoother operations. Since BTTC is fully-compatible with TRON, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, users are able to transfer mainstream assets among TRON, Ethereum, and BSC in a decentralized manner. Openness and accessibility are core values that we practice through our cross-chain strategy, and we find that aligns well with Aave goals.\n\nWe seek to support Aave in its multichain expansion and invite Aave to enable the Aave v2 front-end for BTTC. We believe that BTTC is ready-made to support Aave: BTTC offers a secure infrastructure (multi-node validation), heterogeneous cross-chain solution, faster transaction confirmation (PoS consensus mechanism with an average block time between 2-3 seconds) , and lower transaction fees (<$0.01 on average).\n\nAs the Layer 2 of TRON, BTTC inherits the advanced technology and resources from TRON, as well as $1.1bn TRON Ecosystem Fund. Since TRON’s MainNet release on May 31, 2018, TRON has risen to become the world’s fastest-growing public chain and the world’s largest network in terms of stablecoin settlement. Currently TRON boasts a staggering $70 billion worth of assets, over 66 million TRON accounts, and more than 39.9 billion TRC20-USDT in circulation on its network.\n\nMoreover, BTTC integrates with Binance Smart Chain, which has one of the strongest deflationary mechanisms and currently has more daily active addresses than the rest of all layer 1s combined. That compatibility makes BTTC a better fit for DeFi applications like Aave.\n\nWe are convinced that BTTC is key to ushering in an era of connecting all chains, helping achieve rapid growth across the DeFi space, especially the Aave community.\n\nRationale\n\nCurrent status of the BitTorrent Chain\n\nBitTorrent Chain’s vision is to provide a high-performance, highly scalable, low-cost solution for blockchain platforms that delivers a superior user experience for decentralized applications without sacrificing decentralization while leveraging the existing developer ecosystem.\n\nBTTC is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of consensus. As the first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol in the industry, users can transfer assets within TRON, Ethereum, BSC without any limits. The PoS consensus network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 2-3 seconds, making the network an incredible homecourt for DeFi and other EVM applications.\n\nWhy is it good for the Aave ecosystem?\n\nBTTC is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, economic, and instant finality. The BitTorrent DAO Community has allocated up to $1bn for users of the Aave protocol. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established TRON community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on BTTC will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThere is great potential for synergy between BTTC and Aave. As a close partner of TRON, BTTC will be able to contribute more than $1bn on Aave, and there are already more than $800mn assets of BTTC community on the Aave. The TRON DeFi ecosystem is thriving: Total Value Locked across TRON DeFi protocols is $5.39bn and growing. Many well-known protocols such as JustLend, Sunswap, amongst others, have deployed on TRON. On BTTC, Aave would find many users eager to participate in lending markets and add value to the Aave network.\n\nBesides, as BTTC integrates more mainstream public chains like BSC, it will ease down the process of interacting between users and Aave, and that will definitely catapult the Aave ecosystem to the next level.\n\nWhy is signaling necessary?\n\nConsistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, we believe that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on–and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. Deploying the Aave protocol on BTTC will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.\n\nReference: \nHomepage: https://bt.io/\nGithub: https://github.com/bttcprotocol\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BitTorrent\nMedium: https://medium.com/@BitTorrent\nTelegram: https://t.me/BitTorrentChain\n\n\n",
