        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy a Gnosis DAO Credit Line Aave v3 Instance\n\n**Author:** @ACI and Karpatkey\n\n**Date:** 2024-09-20\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a specific Aave v3 instance to extend a GHO credit line to Gnosis DAO using GNO and wstETH collateral.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGnosis DAO, a long term partner of Aave DAO, has expressed a need for flexible access to stablecoins. This proposal aims to address this need by leveraging Gnosis DAO's treasury holdings as collateral for a GHO credit line funded by Aave DAO. By establishing this credit facility, we can enhance Gnosis DAO's liquidity management capabilities while fostering closer collaboration between Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO.\n\nThe proposed credit line will provide Gnosis DAO with a reliable source of stablecoin liquidity, enabling them to manage their treasury more efficiently and respond quickly to market opportunities or operational needs. This arrangement also presents an opportunity for Aave to expand its services to other DAOs, potentially opening up a new market segment. The credit line will also serve as a proof-of-concept for further customized extension of credit to reputable DAOs and organizations in the industry.\n\nThe GnosisDAO GHO credit line is described by the following conditions:\n\n- **Exclusive Borrower:** Gnosis DAO will be the only borrower in this specialised GHO market.\n- **Collateral Requirements:** GNO and wstETH tokens will be the primary collateral. Other potential collaterals can be considered but must be approved at a later stage.\n- **Risk Parameters:**\n  - Borrowing Rate (BR): DSR rate\n  - Other risk parameters will be discussed and decided upon by relevant service providers in collaboration with GnosisDAO during the ARFC phase of this proposal.\n- **Liquidation Process:** Managed by a designated Aave entity to ensure controlled handling of collateral.\n- **Progressive Cap Increase:** An initial Cap of 5M GHO will be configured\n  - Once the initial cap is utilized and the system operates smoothly for a predefined period (e.g., 1 month), the cap will increase progressively.\n  - The increase will be contingent upon maintaining a healthy average Health Factor (e.g., above 1.5).\n  - Further increases will be evaluated based on ongoing performance metrics and governance approvals.\n\n### Benefits for Aave\n\n- A dedicated GHO borrowing market will increase the demand for GHO and its supply.\n- Generates consistent income from the interest paid on GHO borrowing by Gnosis DAO.\n- GNO is first-class crypto asset that is currently securing the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n- Gnosis DAO will be able to further provide liquidity enhancing GHO's value proposition as DeFi stablecoin in mainnet, and specially once GHO is deployed in GC.\n- GnosisDAO is a reputable DAO with one of the largest treasuries and footprint in DeFi.\n\n### Benefits for Gnosis DAO\n\n- Provides Gnosis DAO with a reliable and sustainable credit line to support its operations and growth.\n- GNO as collateral will increase the treasury's capital efficiency and help in yield generation by borrowing GHO and putting it to use.\n- Tailored risk parameters offer better borrowing conditions compared to other lending markets.\n- Permissioned liquidation within Aave representatives will ensure proper collateral management, minimizing the risk of market manipulation, price volatility and sudden large sell-offs, also protecting Aave from excessive losses.\n- With the implementation of karpatkey's infrastructure and risk management best practices, tooling and monitoring will be put in place to ensure the debt position is properly managed at all times.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Gnosis DAO credit line will implement the following:\n\n- Credit Line Amount: 5 million GHO tokens to start, with the option to size up based on risk service provider feedback and DAO governance process.\n- Collateral Assets: GNO and wstETH\n- Authorized Users: Limited to Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO\n- GHO Borrow Rate: Set to match the current sUSDS rate of 6%\n\nThis credit line will be implemented as a specialized Aave v3 instance with the following key features:\n\n- Customized access controls to ensure only Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO can interact with the instance\n- Tailored risk parameters for GNO and wstETH as collateral assets\n- Regular reporting and monitoring mechanisms to track the usage and health of the credit line. ACI will propose further methods for safe management of this credit line pending further discussions with Gnosis DAO and risk service providers.\n\nBy implementing this credit line, we aim to provide Gnosis DAO with a flexible financial tool that leverages their existing treasury assets while maintaining the security and transparency inherent in Aave.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI did not receive compensation for creating this proposal. ACI and employees are holders and stakers of GNO as well as delegates within the Gnosis ecosystem. Gnosis DAO and Aave also share some service providers including finance service provider Karpatkey.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

        "body": "# [ARFC] Add stS to Aave v3 Sonic Instance\n\n---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Add stS to Aave v3 Sonic Instance\nauthor: @ACI\ncreated: 2025-03-15\n\n> ARFC updated with Risk Parameters 2025-03-25\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard [Beets](https://beets.fi/)'s stS, to Aave v3 Sonic instance.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLaunched in December 2024, Beets Staked Sonic (stS) is an ERC-20 Liquid Staked Token offering seamless exposure to Sonic network staking rewards via validator delegation, while remaining fully liquid in users’ wallets.\n\nSimilar to wstETH, stS passively accrues value—each time delegation rewards are added to the staking pool, the stS-to-S exchange rate increases automatically, with no action needed from holders. The underlying S delegation enhances Sonic’s decentralization across a [diverse set of validators](https://dune.com/queries/4534324/7569460) and strengthens the network’s economic security.\n\nPreviously known as sFTMx, the leading LST on Fantom Opera, stS quickly established itself as the kingmaker LST in the Sonic ecosystem, capturing over [12% of all staked S liquidity and 76% of S LST liquidity](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/sonic). Demand for leverage looping strategies using stS has been steadily rising, with over $160 million already deployed across other lending markets. Despite this strong demand for leveraged positions, stS has maintained a solid peg, currently trading at [99.72%](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/sonic).\n\nUsers can easily convert their S into stS via the [Beets minting UI](https://beets.fi/stake) and redeem their stS with a 14-day unbonding period. Alternatively, they can trade stS directly on any of the following DEXs:\n\n- [Odos](https://www.odos.xyz/)\n- [Beets](https://beets.fi/swap/sonic/0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)\n- [Shadow](https://www.shadow.so/trade)\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nSecurity is at the forefront of stS operations. Beets Staked Sonic was launched in December 2024, with its contracts originally audited by [Spearbit](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/71a6f59b-7533-4ae9-87c5-d1d1bf6d675a), and then further audited by [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-01-beethovenx-sonicstaking-securityreview.pdf) in January. Beets maintains an Immunefi bug bounty of up to $200,000.\n\nRegarding Oracles stS currently integrates a Redstone, Pyth, and Stork stS/S price feed, with a Api3 and Chainlink Oracle integration currently being worked on. Aave will use a CAPO oracle leveraging chainlink's infrastructure.\n\n### Beets in numbers\n\nBeets Staked Sonic has seen continuous growth since launching on December 16th 2024, with 138.65m S and $86.20m currently staked within the protocol.\n\nBeets Staked Sonic is growing at a steady rate and is currently the number one spot by TVL on [Defillama](https://defillama.com/protocols/Liquid%20Staking/Sonic) for LST projects on Sonic, with over 3.4x as much TVL as the second largest protocol:\n\nBeets also runs a DEX on Sonic, resulting in it being the 2nd largest source of TVL across [all protocols](https://defillama.com/chain/Sonic) on Sonic:\n\n### Points program\n\nDue to both the underlying exposure to APR (currently ~5%), and the current Sonic points program which offers 4x passive points and 8x activity points on stS, S borrows vs stS have a seen continuous growth with users seeking efficient means to leverage capital.\n\nBeing the largest LST on the network, stS is integrated into a variety of protocol verticals, including DEXs, Vaults, Yield Tokenization, and Lending markets:\n\n- [Spectra](https://app.spectra.finance/pools/sonic:0xb2b0b641af3efbb495837323f74d962c534c1f51)\n- [Shadow](https://www.shadow.so/liquidity)\n- [Beefy](https://app.beefy.com/)\n- [Stability](https://stability.farm/vaults/vault/146/0x709833e5b4b98aab812d175510f94bc91cfabd89)\n- [Vicuna](https://vicunafinance.com/vaults)\n- [Silo v2](https://v2.silo.finance/)\n- [Euler](https://app.euler.finance/vault/0x2De851E60e428106fC98fE94017466F8D71793d1?network=sonic)\n- [Stablejack](https://app.stablejack.xyz/markets/stS/token?name=yield)\n\n### Benefits of listing Beets Staked Sonic\n\nAdding lending and borrowing support for stS on Aave would allow users to supply, borrow, and leverage Sonic’s flagship LST.\n\nA dedicated stS market on Aave’s Sonic deployment would drive meaningful TVL growth and generate additional revenue for the Aave DAO through active S loans and liquidations. This integration would also position Aave as the go-to venue for risk-adjusted capital efficiency, enabling advanced looping strategies while providing exposure to Sonic points.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Beets also operates a DEX on Sonic, powered by Balancer technology. Beets contributors operate as technical Service Providers to the Balancer DAO and have played a key role in the development and deployment of [100% Boosted Pools](https://www.theblock.co/post/330379/balancer-v3-launches-aave), which have successfully re-hypothicated over [$50M](https://balancer.fi/pools?poolTags=BOOSTED) in liquidity to Aave.\n\nWith the launch of Aave on Sonic, Beets will deploy Aave Boosted Pools, creating a highly efficient mechanism for simultaneously growing Aave’s supply-side liquidity and strengthening Sonic Swap markets.\n\nAlongside stablecoin liquidity such as USDC.e, scUSD and GHO, an stS | S Boosted Pool would likely see strong adoption from Sonic users—helping bootstrap supply while keeping borrowing costs low in leverage markets.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nAs mentioned, Beets can deploy Aave Boosted Pools to help seed Aave’s capital markets on Sonic. While Beets would not directly supply stS or S POL to Aave, it would deposit POL from the DAO treasury into these pools, effectively routing 100% of capital straight to Aave.\n\nAdditionally, Beets is in discussions with Sonic Money Managers regarding the bootstrapping of the stS market through stS <> S looping strategies, as well as Boosted Pool POL deposits. Specific amounts will be determined in collaboration with the Aave team and the ACI, with further details to be shared during the ARFC stage of the proposal process.\n\n## Specification\n\n> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Services Providers and ARFC has been updated accordingly. 2025-03-25\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | stS |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | No |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 30,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | - |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 66% |\n| LT | 68% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | - |\n| Variable Slope1 | - |\n| Variable Slope2 | - |\n| Uoptimal | - |\n| Reserve Factor | - |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | stS/wS |\n\n**stS/wS Liquid E-mode Configuration**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | stS | wS |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 87% | - |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 90% | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 1% | - |\n\n**CAPO**\n\n| **maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent** | **ratioReferenceTime** | **MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 11.04% | monthly | 7 |\n\n## Useful links\n\n- [Beets Website](https://beets.fi/)\n- [Beets Staked Sonic](https://beets.fi/stake)\n- [stS Analytics](https://dune.com/beetsfi/staked-sonic)\n- [Docs](https://docs.beets.fi/)\n- [Github](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/)\n- [Beets Staked Sonic Contract](https://sonicscan.org/token/0xe5da20f15420ad15de0fa650600afc998bbe3955)\n- [Spearbit Audit](https://cantina.xyz/portfolio/71a6f59b-7533-4ae9-87c5-d1d1bf6d675a)\n- [Trail Of Bits Audit](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2025-01-beethovenx-sonicstaking-securityreview.pdf)\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Beets and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

The proposed contributions extend over the three themes detailed below: Treasury Management, GHO adoption and the Aave Stack.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership has created significant value for the Aave DAO across all three focus areas detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/phase-i-summary-karpatkey-tokenlogic/17962). GHO's peg, liquidity, and growth prospects have each improved dramatically over the last 6 months. The DAO's finances are more transparent than ever before and the DAO is firmly positioned for growth.\n\nBuilding on the success of Phase I, we seek to extend our collaboration with the Aave Community for another 6 months. Phase II of our engagement is to focus on enabling GHO and Aave to grow market share through prudent financial management and contributing to numerous growth initiatives. Our three primary focus areas are summarized below:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* GHO Adoption\n* Aave Stack\n\n\n## What to Expect\n\n### Treasury Management\n\n**Asset Management** \n\nThe Aave DAO receives revenue in the form of revenue-generating aTokens for each deployed lending market. Whilst that reduces the need to deploy assets beyond the protocol itself, this creates a need for continual rebalancing of asset holdings.\n\nTo facilitate streamlining routine operational tasks, the [Finance Steward](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570) role, which has been already introduced to the Aave community, will be developed. Given the ability to create allowances, streams, perform transfers, assets bridging, and swaps within pre-approved guidelines and without AIPs, we expect the governance overhead around treasury management to decrease significantly.\n\nThe GHO Finance Steward's capacity to perform swaps will also be improved by the implementation of the [Aave Swap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-swap-upgrade/15311) contract. With this tool, the DAO will be able to acquire assets in a timely and targeted manner, and to support GHO's peg during turbulent market conditions with the ability to create limit orders. \n\n**Financial Security**\n\nA key objective is to define the DAO's annual budget and secure sufficient funds to ensure DAO operations under stressfull market conditions. As the DAO's revenues have exceeded the burn-rate and currently holds more assets (about $145M at [end of June](https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=9&month=6&year=2024&currency=USD)) than planned expenses, this proposal will target to cover a [six months' runway](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/runway) matching holdings with expense tokens or token class as deemed appropriate for capital efficiency. This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Deploying bridging contracts (as required);\n* Bridging Aave funds between networks;\n* Alocating assets for capital efficiency. In particular, migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and\n* Swapping assets to align expenses and holdings.\n\n\n**Aave Analytics**\n\nReporting and analytics functions will be expanded to provide the utmost transparency into the DAO's financial status and overall performance of the protocol, and to support informed decision-making and analysis of the Aave ecosystem. This includes the [Aave Portal](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/) and the [Aave Treasury Report](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), which shows detailed information on DAO holdings and treasury performance.\n\nThe Aave Portal will continue to evolve to showcase the performance of the Aave Protocol and GHO's adoption. Over the next 6 months, the portal will expand to include all revenue sources (incl. Accrued), assets holdings and expenses (incl. budgets) in granular detail, whilst also beginning to include high-level performance tracking across existing covered deployments.\nSeveral legacy community Dune Dashboards will be integrated into the Aave Portal, where they will be maintained and expanded upon over time.\n\n\n### GHO Adoption\n\n**Oversight**\n\nDuring Phase II, GHO's growth is expected to accelerate and expand to several networks. To nurture and maximize the growth potential of GHO, its success hinges on the ability to hold its peg and scale simultaneously.\n\nAs a GHO Steward, we will continue to manage key GHO and GSM configurations, including Borrow Rate, GSM Caps, and GSM fees. As the Treasury Managers, we will ensure the GSM is adequately funded, targetting a collateralization in the range of 5% to 10% of total supply, and that GHO swaps are performed in a manner supportive of retaining a tight peg.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nWe will continue to lead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), overseeing the liquidity growth across different protocols. This includes\n\n* Adjusting liquidity incentives to maintain sufficient market depth;\n* Defining and executing direct liquidity incentives;\n* Leading initiatives that create utility for GHO;\n* Optimizing the utilization of the DAO's strategic voting assets;\n* Supporting GSM Integrations with aggregators;\n* Ensuring GSM are adequately funded;\n* Supporting future D3M, Facilitator, and Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) initiatives; and\n* Support efforts to integrate GHO to Centralized Exchanges, and fund managers.\n\n**Growth**\n\nAs GHO continues to grow beyond Ethereum, our efforts will expand to support those new deployments to ensure adequate liquidity and peg stability is maintained. We will continue to work with teams that build with GHO and advocate for the adoption of GHO wherever practical.\n\nWhen GHO is mature enough to support deploying Protocol Owned Liquidity, we will actively contribute to the creation of sGHO and balancing the needs for sGHO and stkGHO within the Aave ecosystem. \n\n### Aave Stack\n\n**Safety Module Management and Optimisation**\n\nThe Safety Module (SM) currently presents exposure risks due to its reliance on the DAO's native token and its deployment solely on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWith multiple instances of the SM being deployed, we will continue to perform the following:\n\n* Transition from AAVE emissions;\n* Introduce new categories;\n* Amend emission schedules; and,\n* Progressively align protocol exposure with SM holdings; \n\n**Aave Liquidity Network**\n\nWith upcoming changes in the Aave product stack, including the Liquidity Network and the stablecoin's multichain deployment, new challenges will arise in integrating these aspects with other products. We will actively participate in coordination and consulting to support the streamlined and successful deployment of these features.\n\nWhere practical, sunsetting of legacy v2 markets will be supported through continual parameter adjustments to encourage users to migrate to the latest instance of Aave Protocol.\n\n\nBy addressing these challenges, our team aims to support the DAO in achieving sustainable growth and resilience in a rapidly changing environment.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController will be called to create two streams with a start time block 1718673864:\n\n**karpatkey**\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days\nAddress: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\n**TokenLogic**\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses deployment and testings costs.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond the Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] GHO Aave Savings Upgrade\n\n---\n\n**title: [TEMP CHECK] GHO Aave Savings Upgrade**\n**author: @TokenLogic @ACI**\n**created: 2025-03-04**\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks governance feedback and consensus for creating sGHO and defining the Aave Savings Rate (ASR).\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave's GHO stablecoin is growing strongly during 2025 and is the [20th largest stablecoin](https://defillama.com/stablecoins). Whilst growth to date has been strong, growing from 200M to over 300M presents a different set of challenges requiring a different approach.\n\nTo date, stkGHO launched by @ACI, rewards users for contributing to the protocol's security, has been instrumental to GHO's growth journey and currently represents 67% of GHO's circulating supply. After the Umbrella upgrade, stkGHO will remain vital to Aave Protocol's security and is expected to transition towards a size reflective of the protocol's security needs.\n\nBy sizing stkGHO to reflect the Aave Protocol's security needs, this creates an opportunity for Aave to offer a variety of risk profile yield products. This presents an opportunity for the Aave DAO to introduce a new low risk profile saving product that is expected to lead the next chapter of GHO's growth and adoption.\n\nIntroducing sGHO, a low risk savings product that rewards users for staking GHO by earning the Aave Savings Rate (ASR), that compounds over time.\n\n# sGHO\n\nBy depositing GHO into sGHO, users will earn the Aave Savings Rate by holding an ERC-20 receipt token accruing value over time which is easily integrated with other protocols.\n\nsGHO is to be sustained from revenue generated by Aave Protocol and is specifically designed to have the lowest risk profile of Aave DAO's yield product offering.\n\nThe below outlines key benefits of sGHO's design:\n\n* Interest compounding Aave Savings Rate;\n* No rehypothecation providing instance liquidity;\n* Minimal smart contract risk surface area; and,\n* No Deposit or Withdrawal Fees.\n\nA configurable Aave Savings Rate provides the DAO with sufficient flexibility to offer either a fixed or variable savings rate that moves with the broader market conditions.\n\n## Re-hypothecation\n\nTo minimise risk, deposited GHO will remain in the sGHO contract and shall not be deployed to generated yield. This ensures liquidity is always available for users to withdraw and users are not exposed to any protocol risk.\n\nWhilst depositing GHO held within sGHO appears to be the most capital efficient path, this introduces some exit liquidity risks whereby GHO deposited into a protocol can be borrowed by another user. By using a facilitator to Mint and deposit GHO into the yield source, the same capital efficiency upside can be acheived in a more controlled manner.\n\n## Facilitator\n\nWith sGHO expected to create substantial demand for GHO, facilitators are to provide liquidity for user to access GHO. stataGSMs are to provide GHO liquidity via aggregators to avoid GHO deviating from peg whilst other facilitators support GHO being borrowed into circulating supply.\n\nNew Facilitator(s) can Mint and deploy GHO to earn yield. In doing so, rather than deploying GHO held within the sGHO contract, GHO can be Minted and deployed in a controlled manner by the Gho Stewards. This approach preserves the utilisation of liquidity within reserves enabling it to be optimised for achieving a intended borrow rate and maintaining the peg.\n\nFurthermore, Minting GHO via a facilitator increases GHO circulating supply when borrowed. Overal, this approach is similar to how the Gho Stewards manage GHO and how Sky manages USDS on the Prime instance.\n\nThe process of depoloying any additional GHO facilitator(s) is controlled by DAO governance and will be handled separately to this proposal.\n\n## Supply Cap\n\nWith each unit of sGHO being minted, the Aave DAO provides a defined amount of yield that extends the DAOs financial outlay. In isolation, as the portion of GHO held by sGHO increases, the revenue derived from GHO is distributed across the larger sGHO holding base results in either the Aave Savings Rate being revised lower, or requiring additional funding to sustain the savings rate.\n\nTo facilitate processing large withdrawals from sGHO and users exchanging GHO to another asset, DEX liquidity and GSM holding balances are key to sustaining the peg. With these interwoven co-dependencies in place, a Supply Cap on sGHO is proposed. The sGHO `Supply Cap` will be maintained by the Gho Stewards.\n\n## Fees\n\nTo enhance the user experience, there are no deposit or withdrawal fees applied to sGHO. Being a yield product, creating friction via fees would act to reduce the appeal of the offering placing sGHO at a disadvantage to similar offerings available in the market.\n\n# Introductin Aave Savings Rate\n\nBefore reading on, a brief recap of some key terms referenced within.\n\ni) `Deposit Yield` = `Incentive Yield` + `Native Yield`\n\nWhere,\n\n`Incentive Yield` = Yield derived from incentives, commonly referred to as LM rewards.\n`Native Yield` = Yield derived from fees native to Aave Protocol.\n`Deposit Yield` = Total Yield user receives.\n\nAcross Aave Protocol there are two dominant stablecoins, USDC by Circle and USDT by Tether. USDT is the largest, with an emerging trend of some networks preferring to favour one stablecoin over another. Two fast growing networks, Base and Sonic both exhibit a clear bias for USDC over USDT, of which Base has generated substantial growth for Aave Protocol in recent months.\n\nWhen comparing the Native Yield of USDC and USDT across variaous instances Aave Protocol, USDC was found to exhibit a less volatile and more consistent Native Yield relative to USDT. USDC offers both strong market correlation and lower volaility relative to USDT, both are favourable qaulities for deriving a market correlated savings rate.\n\nThe chart below shows USDT and USDC Native yield across Core instances on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base and Optimism.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 19.11.02](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1tM3LGc1l.png)\n\nWhen specifically comparing USDT to USDC, the chart below provides a clear visual reflecting USDCs smoother Native yield profile relative to USDT.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 19.15.58](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1AOhUMqyx.png)\n\nThe Core instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum offers the deepest USDC liquidity and for this reason, the Aave Savings Rate incorporated the USDC Native Yield Rate from the Core instance on Etheruem as its preferred `Index Rate` .\n\nThe Aave Savings Rate definition:\n\n`Aave Savings Rate` = `Amp` x `Index Rate` + `Premium`\n\nWhere,\n\n`Index Rate` = Representative of market conditions\n`Amp` = Amplification Factor\n`Premium` = Nominal Amount\n\nA linear function provides sufficient flexibility to curate the yield to be either variable or fixed and to change the `Index Rate` to which the Aave Savings Rate is correlated to. The `Amp` can be adjusted to offset periods of low USDC utilisation, whilst the `Premium` allows for a discrete amount of extra relative yield to be applied.\n\nWhilst the Aave Savings Rate is expected to exceed the GHO Borrow Rate, the differential is to be managed such that it encourages adoption whilst being insufficent to promote arbitrage.\n\n# Beyond 200M GHO Growth Phase\n\nsGHO is the next step towards realising GHO's longer term growth potential, and with a very well capitalised balance sheet, Aave can accelerate the next chapter of GHO's growth potential.\n\nThe introduction of the Aave Savings Rate is expected to stimulate demand for GHO that will initially improve the peg and then lead to new GHO entering circulating supply via the stataToken GSMs. During the early growth phase for GHO, significant traction was achieved by aggressively incentivising growth and then tapering rewards to retain the growth.\n\nAave DAO is in a very fortunate financial position that is supportive of pursuing an aggressive growth strategy that captures the upside during what is a depressed yield market relative to late Q4, 2024. Launching sGHO with a premium to other similar savings products is expected to lead to significant growth whilst balancing the yield profile as to not overly encourage arbitraging the GHO Borrow Rate and Aave Savings Rate.\n\nThe chart below shows sUSDe, SSR, USDC Native Yield and USDS Deposit Yield on Core instance.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-02 at 16.08.50](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJloMWzjyl.png)\n\nIn terms of risk profile, sGHO is most similar to sUSDS offering from the Sky Ecosystem. For sGHO to compete, given its relative size, a premium would be required to attract meaningful amounts of capital. The USDS Deposit Yield realtive to the SSR highlights the premium for introducing Aave Protocol risk and the utility of being collateral.\n\nOn a risk adjusted basis, the Aave Savings Rate used for sGHO would fall somewhere between the SSR and USDS Deposit Yield on Aave from a competition for capital perspective.\n\nFurther details on the precise Aave Savings Rate to be used when sGHO launches will be provided in the ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\n# Sustainability\n\nDuring the expansion phase, the Aave Savings Rate is expected to present an appealing interest rate that exceeds the GHO Borrow Rate and the Native Rate of the assets held within the stataGSMs. Especially during the early growth stage, the overal economic balance of GHO revenue and costs is going to be heavily shaped by the proportion of GHO's circulating supply deposited in sGHO.\n\nThe below highlights current and near term GHO revenue sources:\n\n* GHO Borrowed via Core instance;\n* stataToken GSM holdings; and,\n* Facilitator liquidity deposits.\n\nBorrowing GHO that has been minted by a facilitor, generates revenue for the DAO through either Borrow Interest like on Core or Native Yield plus Reserve Factor fees as on Prime.\n\n## stkGHO\n\nLonger term, right sizing stkGHO reflecting the Aave Protocol's security needs, is expected to free up budget contributing to sustaining sGHO. Allocating budget from stkGHO to sGHO is exected to reduce per unit of GHO staked spend and lead to an increase in the circulating supply of GHO. This transition is expected to materially impact GHO's revenue upside.\n\nDetails relating to the optimal yield and amount of stkGHO are presented in the Umbrella forum post.\n\n## stataGSM\n\nThe rollout of stataGSMs across Ethereum, Arbitrum and Base is expected to improve the DAO's revenue streams with currently idle capital being deployed to earn yield for the Aave DAO. On Arbitrum and Base, the GSMs will provide users with the ability to `Transafer` GHO into circulating Suppy.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal is to be further refined at the ARFC stage, the following summarises the key characteristics of sGHO:\n\n* No Re-Hypothecation minimising smart contract risk;\n* Facilitators are to be used to Mint and Deploy GHO for yield;\n* No Deposit & Withdrawal Fees promoting frictionless user experience;\n* Introduce a Supply Cap to limit DAO's financial exposure; and,\n* Aave Savings Rate set by GHO Stewards determines sGHO yield;\n\nExecution and implementation is to be a collaboration between by Aave DAO service providers.\n\nThe Aave Savings Rate, budget and sGHO paramaters are to be finalised during the ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe TokenLogic team extends its sincere gratitude to all Aave service providers, delegates, and community members who contributed to this proposal’s peer review. Your expertise and insights have been invaluable in refining and strengthening this TEMP CHECK.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the [ARFC] stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "**Author:** Superstate Inc. – @fig  \n**Date:** 09-12-2024\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temp Check proposes expanding the BUIDL GHO Stability Module (GSM) to incorporate Superstate's USTB. The proposal recommends a 50:50 split between BUIDL and USTB to help increase GHO's stability with diverse reserves and maximized yield.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce an additional industry-leading tokenized U.S. Treasury Bill product to support the stability and efficiency of GHO while maximizing protocol revenue. Superstate recommends expanding the proposed BUIDL GSM instance to include USTB to diversify GHO's reserves, RWA yield sources, and foster a resilient and scalable GSM. Adding USTB to this instance will enhance the GSM's capital efficiency, while also maximizing transparency, liquidity, and yield.\n\nUSTB offers competitive benefits for the Aave ecosystem, bolstering GHO's stability and generating surplus revenue for Aave. Currently, management fees are waived (0.00%) while USTB is under $200M AUM. Once this is surpassed, the management fee is 0.15% for any client balance up to $25M. Aave will benefit from a 67% discount on management fees (0.05%) for any assets above $25M. Furthermore, USTB provides transparent daily Net Asset Value via a Chainlink oracle with a separate Proof of Reserves Chainlink oracle coming soon. USTB's website publishes holdings weekly with daily NAV, AUM, and yield available for anyone to see. You can visit https://superstate.co/ustb.\n\nUSTB is deployed on the Ethereum network, providing onchain access to traditional financial assets sub-advised by Federated Hermes, with UMB Bank as custodian, and Ernst & Young LLP as the Fund auditor. USTB's investment mandate ensures at least 95% of the portfolio is invested in short-duration U.S. Treasury Bills. Up to 5% of the portfolio at any time can be held in cash to facilitate liquidity.\n\nSuperstate Inc. has partnered with Circle, Fireblocks, and NAV Fund Services for USDC subscription/redemption, responsible key management, and third-party Net Asset Value (NAV) calculation. USTB is a Delaware Statutory Trust which means all assets are bankruptcy-remote from Superstate Inc. This means investors (e.g. GSM) are siloed from liabilities that may arise from Superstate Inc. and the other Funds part of Superstate Asset Trust.\n\nEach USTB token (ERC-20) is one share in the Fund, with the number of shares issued/USTB tokens minted equal to the Purchase Amount ($) divided by the Net Asset Value per share (NAV/S) on a given Market Day. Market Days are when both the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia are open. NAV/S increases daily due to the Fund's investments accruing interest.\n\nUSTB works in a similar way to Lido's wstETH. You are minted a static amount of tokens and your token balance stays the same unless you mint, burn, or transfer. The NAV/S increases over time, allowing you to redeem a share of USTB for an increasing amount of U.S. Dollars or USDC.\n\nThe USTB fund currently holds over $125 million in AUM, with more than $150 million redeemed to clients in T+0 or T+1 time frames since inception. USTB is currently onboarded for Arbitrum's Treasury and used in Mountain's USDM Reserves. It is being considered for Ethena's USDe Reserve Fund and Spark's Tokenization Grand Prix.\n\nThis GSM expansion would further diversify GHO's yield sources from real-world assets (RWAs) which should maximize after-fee yield and transparency for the protocol.\n\n## Specification\n\nSuperstate will help Aave Labs expand the proposed BUIDL GSM instance to include a 50:50 allocation towards USTB and BUIDL. This will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO, utilizing the USDC surplus to mint both BUIDL and USTB tokens. Thanks to the instant redeemability between USDC and BUIDL and the yield profile of USTB, the GSM can mint and reedem USTB and BUIDL in exchange for USDC. The first tranche of redemption will come from BUIDL. During the payout, the GSM can redeem USTB, receive USD, and subscribe to BUIDL to rebalance. If desired, Superstate could configure USTB redemptions from the GSM to automatically direct USD proceeds to BUIDL, enabling quicker and more automated rebalancing.\n\nThis proposal ensures a more seamless experience similar to the existing GHO:USDC GSM, while maximizing capital efficiency, transparency, and yield. This structure (splitting between liquid and high-yield products) allows GHO extreme flexibility and USDC support.\n\nThese graphics illustrate the Flow Of Funds for both minting and burning GHO with USDC.\n\n[Note: The images mentioned in the original text are not included in this markdown version]\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided is for informational purposes only and is not investment advice and should not be deemed as investment advice or a recommendation to purchase or sell any specific security.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage and merge with BUIDL proposal if desired.\n4. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights of this Temp Check waived via CC0.",
