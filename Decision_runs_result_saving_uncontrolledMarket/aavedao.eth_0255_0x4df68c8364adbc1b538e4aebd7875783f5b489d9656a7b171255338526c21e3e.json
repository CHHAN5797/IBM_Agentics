        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard ggAVAX to Aave V3 on Avalanche \nDate: 2024-04-29\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe current proposal is set to add ggAVAX, a liquid staking AVAX token issued by the Gogopool protocol, to the AAVE V3 Avalanche market.\n\n### Motivation\n\nGoGoPool is one of the largest Avalanche DeFi protocols. It is ranked number 6 on the Avalanche C-Chain in terms of TVL chain and currently controls more than 500k AVAX (~$23M at current market prices).\n\nWe believe there is currently very large underserved demand for borrowing AVAX against ggAVAX, as ggAVAX is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche. The APYs currently range between 7% and 8%, which is on the order of 33% more yield than any existing competitors on Avalanche. \n\nBeing the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche makes ggAVAX perfect for being a collateral asset, especially for those who seek leveraged exposure to native AVAX yields.\n\n \n![dd93fbd27bc1aac727035529eb5ff6253f57edc8.png](ipfs://bafkreibcfworgked4rc5maanvobvklqy6rmwchfk7rjyoswvyd2chpzsbu)\n    \n\n\nThis yield is achieved through a mix of no protocol fees, running validators instead of utilizing delegation mechanisms, and generating MEV yield from positive market interactions (see dashboard for more details: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK)). \n\nThere is currently more than ~80k AVAX in the ggAVAX-AVAX pools across Balancer and Wombat, making it the most liquid Avalanche LST relative to its size.\n\n \n![8867ec44b2d0dc326eaf4b928b7d7c889eb5f113.png](ipfs://bafkreig3f2xualvcqedjubvgg66tj3jwfkccocvm53l5dc5xtmmo6r5px4)\n    \n\n\nBesides the deep on-chain liquidity, ggAVAX allows users to redeem ggAVAX for underlying AVAX at an internal rate and with no fees. These redemptions are instant as long as there is enough AVAX in the ggAVAX smart contract to facilitate them.\n\nGoGoPool is backed by the Avalanche Foundation and industry-leading investors. In 2022, It raised $7.5M in two rounds [led by Framework Ventures and Coinfund and](https://www.theblock.co/post/166498/gogopool-raises-5-million-to-provide-decentralized-staking-on-avalanche?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) with participation from Silverstone Ventures, Fintech Collective, and Avalaunch. \n\nThe protocol has been [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/GoGoPool%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Kudelski Security](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f90a8443126c2ee50f4c4e/643ee88bf91b375b39ba2613_Kudelski_multisig_labs_report_1.1.pdf) with an additional [Code4rena](https://docs.gogopool.com/audits/code4rena-audit) audit contest. It also has an ongoing [bug bounty program with Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/gogopool/).\n\n### Benefits of listing ggAVAX\n\nListing of ggAVAX on AAVE would create additional demand for borrowing AVAX (in E-Mode) and other assets. Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.\n\nCurrently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nAave V3 on Avalanche.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWith the recent implementation of [Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51), ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed. This is the same approach that AAVE currently uses for sAVAX, wstETH, cbETH, weETH and other LSTs (and LRTs)\n\nggAVAX’s CAPO, however, might require a max growth ratio higher than the 10.1% currently set for sAVAX to account for a generally higher level of yield.\n\nWe welcome any questions about ggAVAX architecture and protocol structure and look forward to working on this with the DAO.\n\n### Specification\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (ggAVAX)|70,000|\n|Borrow Cap (ggAVAX)|NA|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|\n|LTV|30.00%|\n|LT|40.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|NA|\n|Variable Slope2|NA|\n|Uoptimal|NA|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|Emode|No|\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments\n\nGoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.\n\nAfter the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults. \n\nThese and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general. Note that we have already had preliminary talks with a number of protocols on this subject.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://www.gogopool.com/) \n\n[Github](https://github.com/multisig-labs/)\n\n[Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK) \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogopool_)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gogopool.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

KAVA’s EVM compatibility and integration will be a crucial advancement for the Aave multichain vision. The integration will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Cosmos and enables Cosmos ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through KAVA\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to be a starting point in the process of bringing Aave to the KAVA Ecosystem and aims to provide necessary details to the Aave community to consider the merits of KAVA integration. Kava has been building out the cornerstones of a solid DeFi ecosystem since mainnet launch in 2022. The key dexes in the ecosystem are Kinetix (a Uniswap v3 dex plus perpetual trading platform built by the Quickswap team from Polygon), WAGMI (protocol owned liquidity dex), and Equilibre (a ve3,3 dex). There are a few burgeoning lending protocols on the chain, but with the team’s plans to deprecate the existing leading lending protocol on the Cosmos SDK side, Kava Lend, there exists an incredible opportunity for a blue chip lending protocol like Aave to establish market dominance on the EVM side.\n\nIn addition to the market opportunity, the Kava ecosystem has an ongoing incentive program called the Kava Rise program which incentivizes protocol usage pro-rata based on TVL per protocol. Currently 1M Kava is being distributed per month to protocols pro-rata. Due to the proclivity for lending protocols to attract a significant portion of TVL in an ecosystem, Aave stands to earn the majority of these rewards. The current distribution of rewards is 1M Kava per month, and can increase pending governance approval as the ecosystem matures.\n\nThe Kava Foundation has committed to providing liquidity mining rewards of a minimum of 1M Kava guaranteed over the first year for the Aave community.\n\n*Benefits of deploying on Kava*\n\nWith the KAVA integration, Aave gets additional markets with Market Cap of $740M, ~200M of locked liquidity, native assets like ATOM, USDT, WBTC and more. KAVA itself is connected well within the Cosmos ecosystem, thus the integration will also enable the cosmos community to plug its deep $60Bn liquidity to Aave through KAVA.\n\n- Kava today is the 12th largest chain by TVL, and 9th by number of deployed protocols as per DefiLlama 2\n- Kava is an EVM built on top of the Cosmos SDK, this also facilitates bringing Cosmos assets (like ATOM) natively onto the Protocol, which is not possible on other EVMs. AAVE has the opportunity to connect trading in the Cosmos and Ethereum.\n- Kava is the largest of such an EVM chain with native Cosmos integration capabilities.\n\n*Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment*\n\nIn addition, Kava has recently garnered a partnership with Tether, as Tether selected Kava to be the native USDT distributor across the Cosmos. In other words, if a user wants an IBC denominated USDT that’s natively issued by Tether, that USDT needs to originate from Kava. In just a few short months, there has been over $150M USDT natively issued on the Kava blockchain.\n\nWETH is also available as an OFT on Kava via Stargate, and WBTC will soon be issued natively on Kava by Bitgo as well. This provides a plethora of native asset markets for Aave on Kava with deep liquidity.\n\nSome other bluechip deployments on Kava include Curve Finance, Beefy Finance, and an upcoming deployment from Yearn Finance as well.\n\nKava’s latest partnership with Tether, Bitgo, LayerZero and other DApps mentioned above signify its steady commitment to provide a top of the line DeFi ecosystem to users.\n\nOne unique benefit of an Aave v3 deployment on Kava is that Aave would be able to open up Cosmos based markets like ATOM natively on the EVM, which is currently not available on any other chain. We believe this opportunity to open up the Cosmos world to Aave presents a significant opportunity for the community.\n\n# Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Kava Foundation has done a good job of managing its treasury in this recent bear market. Currently the treasury stands at ~360M Kava. The Foundation is happy to seed liquidity in initial markets with up to 50M Kava over the first year.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Kava Rise reward program exists to reward protocols pro-rata based on the amount TVL each project has on a monthly basis. With the commitment to seed liquidity, and the market opportunity for Aave to overtake the soon-to-be deprecated existing Kava Lend protocol, Aave has a clear opportunity to establish TVL and market dominance within the Kava ecosystem, and thereby earn a significant portion of existing 1M Kava/month liquidity mining rewards.\n\nIn short, not only will Kava Foundation commit to seeding liquidity, but that seeded liquidity will also drive the flywheel of liquidity mining rewards for Aave users on Kava.\n\nRegardless of TVL, at a bare minimum, the Kava Foundation will commit to 1M Kava in liquidity mining rewards over the first year for the Aave community. It is completely up to the Aave community how it wants to use these rewards.\n\n*About Kava Rise Program*\n\nKava Rise is an on-chain reward program that rewards builders on Kava. Rewards are distributed monthly on a pro-rata basis on the amount of TVL each project has. The current reward distribution is 1M Kava per month. And this amount can change/increase based on governance as the ecosystem continues to mature.\n\nRead more about the Kava Rise program [here](https://www.kava.io/developer-rewards).\n\n# Helpful Links\n\n- Audit 1: Kava - [CertiK Skynet Project Insight](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kava)\n- Documentation: [https://docs.kava.io](https://docs.kava.io/docs/intro/)\n- Explorers: [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/kava), [Kavascan](https://kavascan.com/)\n- [KAVA Ecosystem overview](https://www.kava.io/ecosystem)\n- Kave [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chain/Kava)\n- [Kava Rise Program](https://www.kava.io/developer-rewards)\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 MVP deployment on Neon EVM Mainnet\n\nAuthor: Neon Foundation & Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of Aave V3 MVP on the NEON EVM Mainnet, expanding Aave’s presence and enabling access to unaddressed users, liquidity, community and ecosystem of Solana.\n\n# Background:\n\nNeon EVM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment solution built on the Solana blockchain which makes it the first parallelized EVM with direct access to Solana liquidity. Neon EVM allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps on Solana and access its native ecosystem and network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities without changing their codebases. Neon EVM currently has interoperability with Solana SPL tokens and the plan is to develop full interoperability with Solana smart contracts as well in 2024.\n\nSolana is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. Solana ecosystem took a hit due to market conditions and FTX situation last year as TVL fell from all-time high of +$9b to +$250m in July 2023 but since then it has shown strong growth and it’s the fastest growing ecosystem across major blockchain networks. Current TVL is over $1.5b making it the fifth-largest chain by TVL.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave has emerged as a prominent player in DeFi lending across various EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, including Ethereum, alt L1s, and L2s. Neon EVM wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Neon EVM Mainnet to expand lending to the Solana ecosystem. Aave’s expansion to the largest non-EVM ecosystem will further reinforce its place as the top liquidity market on-chain and open up possibilities for growth and collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and Neon EVM communities.\n\nAave V3 deployment on Neon EVM will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Solana and enables Solana ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through Neon EVM. The platform will allow Aave to deploy on Solana without any reconfiguration of the Aave v3 codebase and hence without incurring major development efforts and costs to the Aave DAO. Also, a third-party team has already deployed Aave V3 fork on Neon EVM Devnet which implies the full compatibility of Aave V3 codebase with Neon EVM.\n\nThese benefits of Neon EVM combined with Aave’s impressive push for a cross-chain future, provide an exciting opportunity to capture the market share of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and grow the user base and community of the protocol, increase TVL, and protocol revenue. At the same time, Neon EVM would benefit from having a trusted, flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users and wider Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe deployment of Aave v3 on the Neon EVM would enable Aave to tap into the Solana DeFi market and make a unique and significant contribution to the decentralized finance movement. This deployment is expected to substantially reduce costs and better scalability in comparison to EVM networks, while also providing users with access to Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. As Solana gains momentum as a prominent blockchain platform, the integration of Aave’s advanced lending and borrowing protocol could further catalyze the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and Neon EVM.\n\nThere have been significant concerns around the Downtime of Solana blockchain in the past but continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new tools are rolling out on a continuous basis to make the network more resilient, efficient and scalable. For e.g. Firedancer 2 by Jump Crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of Aave v3 deployment on Neon EVM was also recently mentioned by Stani and contributing teams like Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). Tweet by Stani 26, Tweet by Marc Zeller 25\n\nAdditionally, Neon EVM also recently announced the launch of Neon Points Program 10 to attract users and builders to accelerate the adoption of the network. We will include Aave in our points program to incentivize user activity on Aave v3 on Neon EVM with boosted points.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Mainnet with limited deployment of initial assets and conservative risk parameters.This approach will enable Aave to strategically establish a presence in the Solana ecosystem while minimizing risk exposure.\n\nThe proposal suggests three collaterals (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL 1) and one borrowable asset (USDC) with no isolated mode, e-mode enabled for correlated assets (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL), conservative LTV and supply, borrow caps. If this proposal is to pass, we will conduct a comprehensive technical risk assessment for the suggested assets at the ARFC phase to determine their risk parameters. We also invite risk service providers and community members to provide their analysis.\n\n# Infraestructure\n\n- Documentation: [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/quick_start)\n\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Neon EVM supports almost all standards. Here is the link to supported JSON-RPC - [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods)\n\n- Indexers: theGraph\n\n- Oracles: Chainlink, Pyth\n\n- Wallets: Metamask, Ledger and support other EVM network wallets.\n\n- Block explorers: [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/),  [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/)\n\n- Address formatting: It is the same as the standard Ethereum address.\n\n- On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Friendly fork of Gnosis Safe.\n\n- Cross-chain Interactions: [deBridge](https://debridge.finance/) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance/status/1737812739320599032), expected to go live on Mainnet in January)\n\n- NeonPass: NeonPass links Solana and Neon EVM to provide a smoother EVM-compatibility experience for end users (https://neonpass.live/). NeonPass is the revolving door of liquidity between Solana and Neon EVM. NeonPass is not a bridge connecting two separate blockchain ecosystems. Rather, it acts as a two-way transfer tool for bringing assets in and out of the Neon EVM platform, which itself is a Solana smart contract directly connected to the network.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Neon Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Neon Foundation and holds SOL, NEON tokens.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM and proceed with Snapshot if positive.\n\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n# Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] New Chain Deployment Framework\nAuthor: @0xTogbe - Aave Chan Initiative\nCreated: 2023-11-28\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks the community’s approval for a framework to deploy the Aave Protocol on a new blockchain.\nThis framework outlines the standardized process for any blockchain seeking to deploy on Aave Protocol. The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired.

The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Integration Review: Outline the technical details of the proposed integration. This includes specifics on how Aave’s lending and borrowing functionalities will interact with new Aave Deployment. For that, please share the result of both documentation submission and technical review, from TEMP CHECK, so community can understand the level of work, security and commitment. Avoid providing sensitive information.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for ARFC phase, that has been as well implemented in TEMP CHECK stage, to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments.\n\nTo be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not, and details\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n\nSpecification: Include the initial assets that should be available as collateral and their risk parameters in a table. These should have received input from at least one risk manager service provider.\n\nDeployment Checklist: New deployments must have all of the following completed prior to posting an ARFC.\n\n- Risk service providers feedback\n- BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation\n- Oracle recommendation\n- The graph support\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nStatement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nRefine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\nIf consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\nIf consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 on the new chain.\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\n# Next Steps\n- Community Engagement: Engage with the Aave community to gather feedback on the proposed framework for new Aave v3 deployments.\n- ARFC Snapshot: If community sentiment is favorable, initiate an ARFC snapshot to gauge official support for the framework.\n- Implementation: Since this is a governance framework ARFC, if it passes snapshot, it will be implemented as the framework standard for new chain deployments going forward.\n# Disclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum \nAuthor: Kelp DAO & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-07\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 470 Mn+ (~168k Eth) TVL\n- 18K restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH and sfrxETH and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >12 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $4 Mn\n    - [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-67/deposit) - $4 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x64939a882c7d1b096241678b7a3a57ed19445485) - $3.2 Mn\n    - [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x1b06f8fc94b95b6a8075aa1dcf12e69c70144c52?chain=1) - $0.9 Mn\n- $3.5 Mn average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 17th Feb)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nExchange rate is calculated basis the formula:\n\nrseth / eth = [(asset amount in protocol * asset price in ETH)rsETH total supply]\n\nrsEth relies on multiple contract exchange rates for:\n\n1. stEth: As this is a rebasing token, the balance of stETH changes over time and the asset price is taken as 1stETH = 1 ETH.\n\n2. ETHx: Asset price is taken from getExchangeRate( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf5EA1b38380f6aF39068375516Daf40Ed70D299#readProxyContract\n\n3. Sfrxeth: Asset price is taken from pricePerShare( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/token/0xac3e018457b222d93114458476f3e3416abbe38f\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nAs of today, the only way to exit rsETH is via DEXs. KelpDAO is going to enable withdrawals by mid-March 2024 after which users can withdraw Eth or any LSTs via KelpDAO dapp.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n- Contract Address: [0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n- [Github Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
