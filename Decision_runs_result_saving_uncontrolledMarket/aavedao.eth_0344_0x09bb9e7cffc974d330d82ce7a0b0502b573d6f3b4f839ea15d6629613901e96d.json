This proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of the FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism liquidity pools.\n\nIf this proposal is implemented, all flashLoan fees for DeFi Saver users using Aave would be waived. The Aave-Chan initiative believes that any incurred lost potential revenue will be compensated by the increased competitiveness of the Aave protocol and the increased borrow volume.\n\nAbstract\n\nthis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.\n\nMotivation\nDeFi Saver has a long-standing history of synergies with the Aave Protocol, being one of the first third-party integrations of Aave V1 in 2020.\n\nCurrently, every flashloan has a 9 bps fee that rewards liquidity providers in Aave. While flashloans were created by Aave, the ecosystem as a whole has replicated this feature, and most protocols do not implement any fees.\n\nThe ACI does not support waiving the fees for flashloans in general, as we firmly believe that users’ funds used, even in the context of a single transaction, should be rewarded.\n\nHowever, some strategic use cases of V3, such as emode, are very fee-sensitive as they mobilize high leverage. Waiving the DeFi Saver flashloan fees is expected to make these strategies more convenient and profitable, leading to increased borrow volume and thus increased Aave DAO revenue.\n\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as a part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.\n\nImplementation\nThis proposal aims to implement a single AIP, utilizing three similar payloads (one for each network), which will simply call addFlashBorrower() on the ACL_MANAGER contract.\n\nLimitation\nThis AIP grants permission to whitelist any DeFi Saver contract for all use cases, such as leveraged positions, EMODE, debt and collateral swaps, with one exception: no smart-contract that migrates a position outside of the Aave ecosystem is eligible for whitelisting.\n\nDisclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by DeFi Saver for publishing this AFRC.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",

KyberSwap has already been deployed on 14 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and Base. Total trading volume has crossed $21B+ and the current total value locked (TVL) on all chains is $60M+.\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token and an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on proposals to improve KyberSwap. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap and other ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols are added, more rewards are generated.\n\nAdding support for KNC on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow KNC holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their KNC position, attracting new KNC deposits, which would add a new revenue stream for Aave while limiting the exposure.\n\n# Specification:\n\nWe propose the following parameters according to [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-knc-to-ethereum-aave-v3/14824/6?u=alice) and [ChaosLabs's recommendations](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-knc-to-ethereum-aave-v3/14824/6#overview-1):\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (KNC) | 1.200.000 |\n| Borrow Cap (KNC) | 650,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |\n| LTV | 35.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10.00% |\n| Liquidation protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 9.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Stable Slope1 | 13.00% |\n| Stable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset | 3.00% |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00% |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n- **Ticker:** KNC\n- **Contract Address:** [0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202)\n- **Chainlink Oracle:** [0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc)\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.\n\nThe author isn’t compensated by KyberSwap for this ARFC.\n\n# Next step:\n\nThe following steps are as follow:\n\n- gather community feedback and @Gauntlet recommendations on this ARFC.\n- Publish a snapshot of the risk providers' recommendations.\n- If said snapshot is successful, escalate to an AIP.\n\n# Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.\n\nThis integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.\n\nAlongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.\n\nIt's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.\n\nwGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:\n\n- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.\n- wGHO parameters:\n\n| LTV | 77% |\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 80%  |\n| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |\n| Supply Cap | 1M |\n| Borrow Cap | 0 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |\n\n### Note:\n\nwGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.\n\nOnboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback and consensus on this ARFC.\n2. Escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot Stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

There are several types of votes in other communities which are high context and time sensitive that can not be automated.\n\nAave would benefit from optimizing these resources in the most efficient way (i.e: Avoid Curve & Balancer gauges votes weekly on the Aave snapshot and/or management by AIP), and this publication presents the community with an opportunity to establish a voting framework and electing a voting committee.\n\nHow the committee is to vote wouldl be determined by an overall global strategy that is agreed/voted upon, by Aave governance.\n\n# Rationale:\n\nAs a reminder, veBAL positions offer the following benefits:\n\n* Gauge-weight Power: Voting power which influences emissions on the gauges.\n\n* Governance Power: Voting power in the DAO proposals\n\n* veBoost: Holding veBAL earns a boost up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided.\n\n* Protocol Fees: Part of the trading fees sold for bb-a-USD and claimable by lockers.\n\nThis proposal assumes that the veBAL position will be locked from the collector contract, and aims to define how these benefits should be managed.\n\n## Managing strategic assets on Collector Contract\n\nMost of the strategic assets are held on the Reserve Factor Mainnet, which is also where the treasury strategies will be deployed, so it makes sense to focus the whitelist proposals on this contract: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c` (which is the same for v2 and v3).\n\nHowever, DAO process are changing from one project to another, which can create incompatibilities:\n\n* Aave Governance is fully on-chain and only focused on protocols decisions, requiring most proposal to be approved by an AIP (which usually takes more than 1 week to be implemented)\n\n* Balancer Governance is also different (up to 1 year lock), governance power is off-chain, veBoost, gauge power and protocol fees claim are on-chain.\n\nMain benefits\n\n* bb-a-USD & BAL claim function from veBAL rewards is easy to add & automate on the collector contract\n* Governance is off-chain, and can be delegated via Snapshot.\n* veBoost can be utilized.\n* Aave holds a bigger supply share than CRV holdings\n\nMain issues\n\n* It’s not possible to delegate the gauge power on-chain which means that the collector contract would need to cast a new vote each time the veBAL allocation on gauges is updated.\n* New functions should be added on the collector contract to claim BAL from several gauges.where the Treasury could deposit.\n* As the voting power linearly decreases, the position requires to be relocked frequently to retain the max benefits. This part can be automated by Llama.\n* The potential locked holdings would represent ~1,48% of the veBAL supply (good but not enough to sustain Aave DAO various plans mentioned in Part IV)\n\nMoreover, the DAO could decide to allocate some funds on Balancer/Aura to optimize the yield, so these protocols should also be accessible from the reserve factor contract.\n\n### Collector Contract Considerations\n\nAs it would be very inefficient to require AIP for each transaction, this option considers whitelisting the voting committee to manage the strategic positions on the collector contract from the multisig.\n\nThis solution keeps the decentralized ethos of the Aave DAO but is also the most complex to implement than simply delegating the management of the assets to the committee multisig.\n\n* Implement all missing functions to interact with strategic protocols contracts such as Balancer/Aura, allowing to lock / periodically relock, claim, stake/unstake, updateBoost, add/remove liquidity, cast/update gauge votes\n* Elect the voting committee and create the associated multisig\n* Implement whitelists on the collector contract allowing the voting committee to handle the operations without requiring AIP for each transaction\n\n### Voting Committee\n\nThe voting committee would manage the following tasks by having its multisig whitelisted on the collector contract:\n\n* Lock/Relock the veTokens positions\n* Cast votes on gauges\n* Claim protocol fees\n* Claim gauges rewards\n* Update/sell veBoost\n* Follow the strategy profitability\n* Optimize amounts and create votes incentives\n* Claim unspent rewards & DAO vote incentives\n* Compound all strategic assets\n* Transfer all yield (or remaining yield to the collector contract)\n\n# Technical Implementation\n\n* Elect the voting committee\n* Deploy the multisig\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Proceed with Committee\n\nNAE - No Committee\n\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem. Some members of Llama are unpaid delegates in the Paladin ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.
