        "body": "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings\n\nAuthor: @Dydymoon\n\nDate: 2023-08-29\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Proposal resubmitted as the last vote didn't reached the quorum.*\n\n# Summary\nExplain AIP-42 proposal & gauge the community thoughts to update the strategic assets from veBAL to an alternative solution increasing the emission power considering current metrics.\n\n# Background\nIn March 2022, Llama proposed a strategic partnership with Balancer (Part I & Part II). The DAO used the BAL to buy B-80BAL-20WETH LP tokens, that would be locked for veBAL. This position was meant to be used for its emission power, enabling rewards redirection on AAVE & GHO gauges.\n\nThis estimated veBAL position & market metrics at the time were taken into account for the SM upgrade proposals (which includes migrating the current LPs to Balancer V2, implement new categories & slashing parameters, define the smBPT gauges, updates incentives management, create a strategic asset management framework, and further considerations.)\n\nConsidering that veBAL was likely to be needed before the SM upgrade implementation, Llama introduced the StrategicAssetsManager contract, creating a base framework to manage assets from Goverance or with a committee. The TEMP check vote ended mid July, and the contract was submitted to BGD for review after.\n\nFrom Llama’s side, the code supporting veBAL position is already implemented via the StrategicAssetManager contract and can be deployed pending community feedback. However, an external proposal from Aura drastically impacted the veBAL strategy early August.\n\n# Motivation\nOn July 28th, a proposal (AIP-42) was submitted 4 on the Aura governance forum, with the goal of improving $AURA distribution efficiency especially on L2s and alignment of parties receiving Aura rewards.\n\nWhile there are benefits for Aura and vlAURA holders, this proposal also directly impacts veBAL holders in several ways, which is why the Aave DAO should be aware of it.\n\nThe proposal (approved on August 6th) considerably impacts the $AURA emissions by reducing the base distribution by 60%, which is compensated by $AURA distributed from the treasury, but only to vlAURA voters according to their voting weight on gauges.\n\nAs a reminder, there are min & max APR on Balancer, depending on veBAL holdings/boost acquired, while Aura is using its share of the veBAL supply to boost LPs & add AURA rewards in return of a fee on BAL rewards, making it more efficient for most LPs to deposit.\n\nFor this reason, the value of incentives generated per 1$ of bribes can take into account BAL + AURA emissions, which was equivalent before AIP-42 (i.e you’d get the same emission power by farming on Aura & voting with veBAL or with vlAURA)\n\n*Post AIP-42 this changes, because:*\n\n* veBAL emission power is limited to BAL + base Aura rewards (reduced by 60%)\n* vlAURA emission power is increased with BAL + base AURA + additional AURA rewards from Treasury\n\nAura will keep boosting LPs with its veBAL share, and should keep a higher APR than Balancer for depositors.\n\nConsidering that emissions changes took effect on August 24th on Aura, it’s still early to draw conclusions and it might take time for the market to react & adapt. While some changes can already be observed, it might take at least 1-2 extra rounds (2-4 weeks) for the market to normalize.\n\n## Potential impacts of AIP-42 related to Aave utilization:\n\n### veBAL emission power reduced:\n\nAs only vlAURA can redirect extra rewards from the treasury, 1 veBAL will have less emission power than the equivalent vote in vlAURA.\n\n### veBAL holders migration to vlAURA:\n\nAssuming that veBAL holders are considering to switch to vlAURA, it could have several sub impacts:\n\n* veBAL holders choosing to let their position decay to exit (increased BAL emission per veBAL: temporary if ppl then migrate to auraBAL or another wrapper effectively relocking veBAL, but not if assets are sold for AURA and locked.)\n\n* If veBAL holders sell their BPT for AURA on market, the AURA price would increase because of the limited liquidity. It could also impact BAL price and B-80BAL-20WETH liquidity.\n\n* If the veBAL accumulation by Aura protocol is not following this potential migration, it would lead to a dilution of the veBAL underlying vote per vlAURA (a small decrease was already visible over the past days, to 0,1587 veBAL/vlAURA currently)\n\n### veBAL/vlAURA bribe cost update by the market:\n\nSome changes are already visible on bribe marketplaces, but we should expect more updates to happen in the coming weeks: Since veBAL has less emission power, the bribe cost should also decrease. On the other side, since the overall AURA emission is lower, so the bribe cost also seem to decrease, but the value / veBAL vote should increase, creating a decorrelation in the pricing depending on which asset is bribed. Another aspect to take in consideration post AIP-42 is the proportion of vlAURA votes / total votes bribed.\n\nBefore Aura proposal, the emissions were equivalent, but now, whether the split is 20% veBAL 80% vlAURA or the opposite considerably changes the results, so it’s most likely to see vlAURA bribed first.\n\n### Pros of switching to vlAURA:\n\n* Max emission power on DAO owned strategic assets\n* 4 months lock (compared to veBAL lock time is 1 year)\n* No decay on vlAURA, meaning no need to relock weekly\n* Voting are calculated in round (2 weeks) so less votes to cast\n\n### Cons of switching to vlAURA:\n\n* Liquidity is small so it can be an issue if Aave DAO wants to acquire AURA on market but OTC deals can be considered\n* Risk of efficiency reduction if the Aura protocol BAL accumulation doesn’t follow the vlAURA supply increase.\n* No veBoost on vlAURA (but Aura deposits are boosted with their veBAL share)\n\nvlAURA allows for more agile management. Considering that Aave DAO voted to lock veBAL but didn’t lock it yet, it makes sense to consider an update of the strategic assets allocation.\n\n# Other Considerations:\n\n* Long-standing strategic relationship between Aave and Balancer\n* Cost of selling B-80BAL-20WETH BPT\n* Cost of acquiring vlAURA via OTC deals\n* Understanding any potential security and ecosystem risks involved\n* Dev resources to add vlAURA support to current StrategicAssetManager\n* Review time by BGD of the vlAURA implementation\n\n# Specifications:\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to consider an update of the Balancer ecosystem holdings (B-80BAL-20WETH) for an alternative solution. This would mean dedicating part (or all) of the current B-80BAL-20WETH holdings to acquiring vlAURA in order to retain the max emission capacity of the voting power held by the DAO.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, ARFCs will be published:\n\n* To add vlAURA support to the StrategicAssetManager contract (Llama)\n* To share options considered for AURA tokens acquisition (TokenLogic)\n\n# Disclaimer:\nCurrently contributing to TokenLogic & Llama as a strategist, I participated in the Llama proposals mentioned above and am currently working on SM strategy, as well as on the GHO liquidity strategy with TokenLogic.\n\nThe analysis can be useful for both purposes above but is published on my own initiative, so this proposal is not requesting compensation from any third party. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared to facilitate understanding & community discussion.\n\n# Next Steps:\nTEMP CHECK: Gather community feedback and sentiment towards the proposal of updating Balancer ecosystem holdings for a more efficient solution with the following voting options:\n\n- YAE (Update the strategy)\n- NAY (Use veBAL as intially voted)\n- ABSTAIN\n\nARFCs: If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\nAIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",

        "title": "[ARFC] Treasury Management - GHO Liquidity Strategy Update",
        "author": "0x2cc1ADE245020FC5AAE66Ad443e1F66e01c54Df1",
        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GHO Liquidity Strategy Update\nAuthor: @TokenLogic\nDated: 2023-09-08\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication details the revised liquidity strategy for GHO across Ethereum DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis publication outlines the GHO liquidity strategy with two main objectives:\n\n* Improve GHO peg\n* Promote diversified liquidity across multiple exchanges\n\nIt is widely accepted that the GHO peg requires improvement. This was especially evident when GHO traded at beneath 96 cents.\n\nFurthermore, several liquidity pools have come about organically on Maverick, Uniswap and Curve. Similar to the Balancer pools, these pools are mostly GHO which is reflective of the GHO price relative to the stable coin being paired within each pool.\n\nDo note, the existing Balancer pools are not being supported by Aave DAO. These pools are being supported by veBAL and vlAURA holders, mostly from contributors within each community.\n\nThe two initial pools being considered are GHO/USDT/USDC and GHO/LUSD until SM integration. This will be presented in a separate forum publication for future discussion. This publication will outline the Primary and Secondary Pools being proposed for GHO:\n\n* Balancer GHO/USDC/USDT - Primary\n* Balancer GHO/LUSD - Primary\n* Maverick GHO/LUSD Static - Secondary\n* Maverick GHO/LUSD Both - Secondary\n* Uniswap (Bunni) GHO/USDC Wide - Secondary\n* Uniswap (Bunni) GHO/USDC Narrow - Secondary\n* Curve Finance GHO/crvUSD - Secondary\n\nFor the purpose of this publication, we shall focus on the non Curve Finance pool. The GHO/crvUSD, and potentially GHO/FRAXBP, will be supported initially by the Aave DAO strategic asset holding once ready. How the DAO is to deploy the recently acquired CRV, is still yet to be determined.\n\nThis proposal aims to create a structure of liquidity outside of the SM strategy, including efficient options such as concentrated ranges of liquidity incentivised with and create a 3 months trial budget for vote incentives/rewards.\n\n## Maverick\n\nMaverick is an AMM capable of automating liquidity strategies without requiring maintenance. It enables to maximise capital efficiency by automating the concentration of liquidity as price moves. This built-in feature also helps LPs to eliminate the high gas fees that come from adjusting positions around price themselves.\n\nMAV is the governance token, however the tokenomics aren’t fully revealed yet. It’s known that MAV has a veTokenomics model. MAV emissions didn’t start yet, but it’s possible to incentivize liquidity on Maverick by adding rewards by creating & incentivising a boosted pool for a defined amount of time between 3 to 30 days.\n\n[A GHO/LUSD pool with 3 BPS & 0,1% width](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x30856df27a23d72b67347165f85e04b15d716d9e?chain=1), with liquidity in the range from 0,9811 to 0,9980 GHO per LUSD has been created and incentivised by Liquity with 1,5k LQTY per 7 days during 3 weeks. Additionally, LUSD liquidity managers proposed to create co-incentives for GHO/LUSD pools by committing up to 5K LQTY/month for the trial duration if this proposal is approved.\n\nConsidering that a range can’t be updated by governance, and since the pool was full GHO a few days ago, we’re considering updating the strategy above by creating a wider mode static boosted pool, and creating a pool mode both on top.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H15VjV8ya.png)\n    \nAs that the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch & since the unspent budget can’t be clawback (liquidity mining), incentives will start with a lower amount for a small duration (7 days) to easily follow the liquidity growth with the budget. Additional incentives can be added at any time.\n\nPros of incentivising liquidity on Maverick\n* Automated rebalancing\n* Fully customisable strategy\n* Maximal liquidity efficiency\n* Co-incentives if paired with LUSD\n* Protocol Owned Liquidity can reduce costs\n\nCons of incentivizing liquidity on Maverick\n* MAV emissions are not live yet\n* Updating a range requires to create a new position\n* Pools contracts are not verified yet\n* Boosted pools incentives are limited to 30 days (can be renewed)\n\n## Uniswap v3, Bunni.pro & Liquis\n\nUniswap V3 allows concentrated liquidity: liquidity allocated within a custom price range. It highly increases liquidity efficiency, leading to more volume, and with the potential of supporting stablecoins peg.\n\nBunni is a liquidity engine for incentivizing Uniswap v3 liquidity composed of two parts:\n\n* Protocol that wraps Uniswap liquidity positions into fungible ERC-20 tokens\n* vetokenomics system for incentivizing Bunni liquidity\n\nIt enables the creation of gauges receiving emissions while liquidity is in range. However, the liquidity isn’t actively rebalanced and gauges can be killed if the liquidity is out of range.\n\nLiquis is a governance wrapper for Bunni.pro similar to Convex & Aura.\n\nA [GHO/USDC pool with 0,05% fees](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x5c95d4b1c3321cf898d25949f41d50be2db5bc1d), with the range from 0,9497 to 1,0247 GHO per USDC has been created by community members. Timeless core contributors created an initial smaller range from 0,9757 to 1,0253 GHO per USDC, and submitted the proposal [TRC-66](https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/12245-trc-66-enable-ghousdc-gauge-with-2-cap) to enable GHO/USDC Gauge with 2% Cap on Bunni, which was [approved on July 27th](https://snapshot.org/#/timelessfi.eth/proposal/0xdf4027ad5c071bcbf045b9cb096ee63cae8bccacf4f33e489e50942c906419ee).\n\nRanges can be updated by governance, and since GHO went below the current price over the past days, we’re considering updating the wide range above, and creating a new narrow one on top.\n\nThe Aave DAO does not hold veLIT & oLIT incentives total worth is limited, so to reach the TVL target, this strategy will initially be supported with both veLIT/vlLIQ votes incentives created on Warden Quest, and GHO liquidity mining deposited on Bunni.pro gauges.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H14_jELJ6.png)\n    \nBunni gauges are not live yet, so the Min/Max APR on oLIT emissions will update depending on the actual working supply of each pool. For these estimations, the working supply used is from the current GHO-USDC proportionally to the estimated TVL.\n\nLiquis just launched and will enable a better optimisation but the LIQ token has no price yet, and the first round vote ended on September 6th so it’s not yet included in the tables below but this strategy will most likely be improved in the coming weeks.\n\nNevertheless, they have a launch partner program ongoing giving access to LIQ tokens vested in exchange of a bribe amount committed over 6 months max, but closing this week as the protocol launched.\n\nThe conditions are 0,1% of LIQ supply vested over 4 years for 10,000$ worth of votes incentives for vlLIQ holders (controlling veLIT voting power). While the tokens are vested, the voting power can still be used until the end of the vesting duration, further increasing the yield or enabling recycling part of the bribes spent. More information on the program can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/liquis.eth/K_-1jp7sLkylKc2V1XxkK0CObsqyaTq-89yScI4tapo).\n\nveLIT bribes were initially considered, so if this proposal is approved, the Aave DAO will be a launch partner by committing an amount of $20k of votes incentives for vlLIQ holders over the next 3 months and will receive 0,2% of the LIQ supply.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1m5oN8yp.png)\n    \nThese estimations are made at the current time so it excludes LIQ emissions, liqLIT redemption mechanism, DAO vested voting power & impact on the strategy. The tables will be updated in the coming weeks if the overall strategy is approved. The proportion of bribes veLIT vs vs LIQ vs LM might also be optimized during the trial.\n\nSimilar to Maverick, as the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch & because the unspent budget can only be clawback, which represents a limited part of the budget, LM rewards will be added progressively every 7 days to follow the TVL growth.\n\nPros of incentivizing liquidity on Bunni/Liquis\n* Built on top of Uniswap v3\n* LIT tokenomics are live (oLIT & veBoost)\n* Liquis (Convex-like) recently launched will enable strategy optimisation\n* Launch partner program earning LIQ tokens vested & voting power\n* Updating a range earning rewards can be done by governance\n* Extra liquidity mining rewards can be added on Bunni gauges\n* Protocol Owned liquidity can reduce costs\n\nCons of incentivizing liquidity on Bunni/Liquis\n* Liquidity is not automatically rebalanced\n* oLIT option token design is complex for users (liqLIT improves this)\n* BPT 80/20 design & oLIT redemption create selling pressure on LIT token\n* Reward are split between emissions from bribes + LM\n* Bunni gauges can be killed if out of range ([Process](https://docs.bunni.pro/docs/guides/kill-gauge))\n\n## Balancer & Aura:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the existing Balancer pools are not being supported by Aave DAO yet and votes on GHO gauges depend on veBAL and vlAURA holders, mostly from contributors within each community. Moreover, GHO/USDC/USDT & GHO/LUSD are expected to be included in the SM at a later stage, but might need to create a base liquidity supported by the DAO before external votes fades away.\n\nBoth pools currently have classic gauges eligible for BAL rewards. According to recent changes from AIP-42, the budget allocated will be used to create vlAURA votes incentives on Warden Quest.\n\nThe initial strategy proposed is 400k vlAURA votes bribed to sustain 5% APR on a $5M TVL for each pool. The APR could be increased later on by using Aave voting power and blacklisting the DAO from the created Quests to attract more voters for the same cost.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1m2iVIyp.png)\n    \nHowever, spending incentives on stableswap liquidity could be counter-effective before GHO peg is restored, so incentives might start after concentrated liquidity ones, and if the external support left.\n\nSimilar to Maverick & Bunni, since the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch, incentives will be deposited progressively to follow the liquidity growth. Nevertheless, 100% of the budget is spent in bribes so the unspent budget can be clawback on Warden Quest, enabling Aave DAO to pay a fixed price per vote for an important amount without overspending if the votes target isn’t reached.\n\nAs always, happy to fix potential mistakes in the strategies estimations if any.\n\n# Reward Budget Overview\n\n## Maverick & Uniswap v3, Bunni & Liquis (Concentrated Liquidity)\n\n![|614x136](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KZT-mvb1ghTBmz8020oRT9Weuuhpb9fkQo5I6gxtWctBbsSHosgKImk2xTOd43_ecTyuYY69RdbBYpvZaz8rufVuHEwMf0ql7wlA-fcIud5NJxtDcc7cl5Z8tX0w3n95eXwVxhV5pX4ODeExRq3lAlc)\n\n## Balancer/Aura \n\n![|614x97](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nStACC51kMLhOAjPpR3ggm4CnN4nCnnNlsW-nCvwDbJVmusGylrbI76Vdh9HrvhBTKb2bN8kn8UaQvpmRFZDZuOl3Mj2iWu0O4u6moaryipfDShySP95EG88ecnvkoaIh46-tWh4D0jNqK4LP8xjinY)\n\nThe budget breakdown below contains two different margins:\n\n* Assume that all strategies will begin to be incentivized at the same time, and with the maximum amount.

        "body": "---\n\n[ARFC] Deploy BAL & aBAL from the Collector Contract\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham) and @dydymoon\nCreated: 2023-02-05 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents two options for deploying the approximately 100k BAL tokens being acquired by AIP 115 and the aBAL holding in the Ethereum Collector Contract, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nAIP 115 has been successfully implemented and Aave has acquired an additional 100k BAL on market. The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].\n\nAave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.\n\nOption 1) Locking veBAL.\nOption 2) Staking auraBAL.\n\nOption 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).\n\nA Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.\n\nAave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:\n\n* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].\n* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].\n* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].\n\nThis proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.\n\n## Option 1) Locking veBAL\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nIn Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.\n\n### What’s veBAL ?\n\nveBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc\n\n* **Gauge-weight Power**\nVoting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.\n\n* **Governance Power**\nVoting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.\n\n* **veBoost**\nLocking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.\n\n* **Protocol Fees**\n75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].\n\n### veBAL Position Overview\n\nBy maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].\n\nWith 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).\n\nBAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.\n\nAave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies\n* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n\nThe boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.\n\nThere remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].\n\n### veBAL yield overview\n\nThe veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:\n\n* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)\n* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)\n* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold\n\nIn the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week\n\nveBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92\n\n* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.\n\nIt’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.\n\n## Option 2) Staking auraBAL\n\nOption 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.\n\nAfter the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].\n\nDepositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.\n\nThe yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.\n\n* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.\n* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).\n* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.\n\nGrowing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.\n\nWith 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.\n\nBy staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].\n\nOption 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.\n\n## Comments\n\nTo help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.\n\nThere are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nTo summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|\n|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|\n|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|\n\nThe amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at\n\nLlama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:\n\n1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH\n2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap\n3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.\n![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)\nThe BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL\n4. Approve BAL on Cowswap\n5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH\n\n![|312x312](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NyamWu2oOW0-UTQrXfcgD2kR4Z6J64pqWmD2kFrcZd_8Ay-MrXsGlGtIXnKSbhcHjzvfFFMtGTc_Hlpuel5Qp0j8GevSPNkqB9AkPN5LZhQLmAW-c8jYmESZPCkEI4QkSc8QaOhdFarIytRV6uq2QNA)\n\nAave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.\n\nAt the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70\n$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56\n\nIn performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).\n\nThe number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.\n\n\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.\n\nThose considerations are:\n\n* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade\n* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]\n* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmVqWgpRmoEvvhvXZFepmAgYU5ZK9XpSs39MExEUpiJZw3\n[3] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484/19\n[5] https://dune.com/queries/782195/1395498\n[6] https://app.warden.vote/dashboard/\n[7] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ac1109d58b02b5b74f10d92fb816a9cdc4b198fd455cc2bb2fdbb52ae84f9e\n[8] https://etherscan.io/token/0x616e8BfA43F920657B3497DBf40D6b1A02D4608d?a=0x5e5ea2048475854a5702f5b8468a51ba1296efcc\n[9] https://dev.balancer.fi/resources/deploy-pools-from-factory/creation/aavelinearpool\n[10] https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n[11] https://app.aura.finance/#/lock\n[12] https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249\n[13] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [13].",

These rewards allow Aave to attract deposits, where up to 30% can be used to insure the protocol in case of shortfall event. At the moment, 100% of these incentives are spent in liquidity mining from the Ecosystem Reserve, which represents $89.3K daily or $32.6M yearly expense for the DAO.\n\nThis publication presents the community with an opportunity to reshape how AAVE incentives are distributed to significantly improve Aave’s economics and enhance the capital efficiency of the SM.\n\n* Increased Backstop Value\n* Decreased AAVE Spend\n* Increased Yield for depositors\n* Improved Profitability and Financial Sustainability\n\nThis publication focuses on how incentives are distributed to reduce the overall AAVE spend without exceeding the current AAVE budget & shares the estimated results from the strategy.\n\n# Rationale\n\nA quick recap of proposed from the current design so far:\n\n* Part I - SstkABPT update proposal (Part I)\n  * Support of the migration to a new BPT B-80-AAVE-20wstETH\n\n* Part II - Categories implementation (Part II)\n  * Single assets, volatile BPTs and stable BPTs.\n\n* Part II- Slashing update (Part II)\n  * Each category will have a different max slashing parameter\n\n* Part III -BPT positions staked on the SM - smBPTs (Part III)\n  * Create gauges for smBPTon staked assets and enable users to receive to avoid incentives dilution, Introduce smBPT wrapper, and explain Aura Finance strategy to receive BAL & AURA rewards.\n\nThis publication presents a revised outlook on how the majority of the current AAVE budget could be distributed as vote incentives for smBPT gauges. Additionally, the DAO could decide to optimize its strategic voting power to reduce the SM costs.\n\nDo note the APR generated from depositing into the SM has dependencies such as the BAL, AURA and AAVE token prices. If this proposal is approved, several solutions can be explored to reduce this risk. If it becomes unprofitable over time because of BAL or AURA prices, a fallback option can be added to switch back to the current LM design if needed until finding a better optimization.\n\nThe design is flexible enough to accommodate various market conditions and for Aave to pivot from AAVE to GHO rewards over time. This represents a shift on the base incentives from Aave governance token distribution to yield derived from cash flow sustained by the business.This will allow to improve the fallback option to always optimize the best yield between direct profit sharing distributed or used to leverage more yield through votes incentives.\n\n## veBAL Voting Power\n\nLlama recently published a proposal to deploy the BAL holdings. This proposal will help provide a better understanding of why Llama recommended the community to vote for acquiring veBAL.\n\nOverview of the veBAL position if locked today:\n\n![|566x186](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2xlP4WbgttqDygSf06fk1AyRlqdq8JgW_xVGyPyZnkcNpN9EEGFfY_H_VMcVozZY9mrdzrQrp37PxbXQkSUxTjHYvsavlxyvvFFGqoHp80eLqjc7owdYdFugJ40Tp7xs2nbYZoKnNRk7dWkO9wzx5CA)\n\nETH needed and the LP tokens amount received are verified with https://balancer.tools/veBAL.\n\n![|414x79](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LECeCOxUTEB4UlvHAyEaCa3FEImGhUYGdDxKUCULK_eqW7dU9V4MaEF70AH6pJFHOMSjM-KaCjcJ-T_l8qG_sSu-L611Ctjk6JejFn6pDxWe1r13IIa9dsVQ2mYsgykdgYqIyFO2LqE73491CcNtjE0)\n\nThe table above shows how much weekly BAL emission is controlled, assuming the DAO uses only its owned veBAL voting power (i.e. without creating vote incentives).These calculations are based on the BAL emission in April 2023: 121,930 BAL/week instead of 145,000 until March 2023.\n\nAave DAO voting power is a good start and can be utilized to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Boost the Staked aTokens gauges\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimize the yield on treasury strategies\n\nHowever, due to the limited veBAL holding size relative to Aave’s aspirations, the community will need to choose between the choices above. Several other possibilities to increase the strategic voting power accumulation in addition to the reserve factors earnings are presented below:\n\n* [Deploy treasury strategies to farm BAL/AURA with stables & ETH](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-ethereum-collector-contract/12205)\n\n* [Acquire more BAL/start acquire AURA with the treasury to lock it ](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer-part-2/7813)\n* Potential Grants from Aura & Balancer\n\n## Safety Module Cover Overview\n\nAssuming that 100% of the Aave TVL was covered by the SM, the DAO would pay 30,02% on its insurance.\n\n![|602x59](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_4IccaU07Rbv86PhERhDx1iYKoJDNE01HRG31zy3tSaqw0OAn_RY8AufyPgdDFLddVifzmD4xQmow_tzDYmH7yzg7gTbRUEu94dP_AgnVEl5sbwx5GviMWSSMue0ulB1eFAn5HTE0QgBNF4rBqGWgSI)\n\n(1.43% of the TVL is currently covered and the DAO which pays 30,02% APR on these funds). The new strategy aims to increase the Safety Module coverage above 2.00% while also reducing insurance costs by at least 30%.\n\n## Incentives Distribution Upgrade\n\nNote that all TVLs below have been added to estimate the max capacity of the SM with the current budget by maintaining the APR in range.\n\n### Single Assets\n\nThis publication features continuing the rewards with 25% of the current budget for single assets. At a later date, the community can explore progressively replacing AAVE with GHO rewards.\n\n* AAVE: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n60% of the current stkAAVE TVL\n\nWe estimate a reduction of the TVL due to the APR lowered by the budget reallocation\n\n(200 AAVE/day until GHO is live vs 550 AAVE/day at the moment.) .\n\n* ETH / stETH: TVL Estimation used for the upcoming calculations:\n\n75k ETH / stETH\n\n(Llama proposes to allocate a budget of 75 AAVE/day to reward ETH and/or stETH deposits until GHO is live)\n\nThis means reducing the liquidity mining by focusing it on single assets only, since it’s not possible to add gauges for it. The remaining AAVE currently being spent in LM to incentivize both veBAL & vlAURA voters on Warden Quest, which allows to redirect rewards on smBPTs gauges, in a better proportion than LM.\n\n## What is Warden Quest?\n\nWarden Quest by Paladin, offers a new approach to Gauge Weight vote acquisition for Curve & Balancer. Instead of offering an arbitrary amount of rewards to influence voters, Quest allows players to set parameters & rewards for each weekly vote period.\n\nAfter the rewards distribution to voters, if the total budget wasn't spent (i.e.,if the objective wasn't reached), Quest creators can redeem the unspent budget minus the fees.\n\nAdditionally, Quest now offers the possibility for vlAURA holders to claim rewards from veBAL quests, allowing Aave DAO to create vote incentives for both at once.\n\nFinally, with the estimated budget of this post, Quest fees would be at 2,8% instead of 4%.\n\nNote: This proposal doesn’t plan to create vote incentives on the StakedATokens gauges, but the DAO could vote to do it later. In such a case, the Quest weekly volume would lead to the lowest fee possible: 2%. More information on Warden Quest can be found [here](https://doc.paladin.vote/warden-quest/introduction).\n\n## Volatile & Stable BPTs\n\nThe SM Upgrade strategy aims to maintain the volatile BPTs APR in the 8 to 12% range, and the stable BPTs APR in the 18 to 22% range. The BAL & AURA rewards could be distributed weekly to SM depositors.\n\n* B-80AAVE-20wstETH: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n* B-80GHO-20wETH: Max TVL estimation used: $50M$\n\n* B-GHO-3Pool: Max TVL estimation used: $100M\n\n![|602x132](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/SpKMcUQtiB4wEV4_28TEmzln1kV-XvgxaMWl8b7Gskws4NyE3R4_s4sGxGCBSzI8EDv254g8Jep_kTdi74E4OEEzYijcNq56-6Kxp-0KGO2_NrquOGi0ll3R-RtSEB9XO2oAqzoR9sFhHQWkGr6Gpfw)\n\nThese estimations demonstrate the possibility of reaching the APR targets outlined above.\n\nThe vlAURA votes amount needed is defined by a target in veBAL votes, which is why the total exceeds 100% of the vlAURA supply.The veBAL votes target can be reached by creating vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, veTETU and sdBAL, all supported on Quest.\n\nNote: veTETU vote incentives would require more management as veTETU on Polygon, so we’ve excluded it from this proposal for now. sdBAL vote incentives are also excluded because of the small veBAL holdings.\n\n![|602x152](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/64YqdC6KmmZAUULAUOg71tPIv1c0B1bLlomXQ6jJVgcwf18mWUMAcZhdcBvdLhi7NjPLJYoTftfl2YPxsZ179v8u_ogbq0Es3U61gptCID7YD1QnxsNL61f3bfMhaRz4N1669rUJTy9jGyy4SyjN4R0)\n\n(Yellow cells are manually added & Orange cells are max estimated TVL. The remaining data are calculated or imported from Etherscan and CoinGecko data in real time, so numbers are changing very often depending on all the variables).\n\n## smBPTs Quests Results Overview\n\n![|602x83](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xmMXkpyZUu4J7HJC9r_b0lZyKGiWp-_LXkst-HVh9QRFTuHuMXCiWC0aNI_aOdckGrvTfu1Zt6Q9uLKFDRfqaFT9vZUOLIbsDe04lrjVEppw9sb8li1bbpVKsTkZZc3ACHIhUQkcQzx_6z1mEokw7bM)\n\nThe cost per vlAURA/round is from [Llama Airforce](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/rounds/hh/aura-bal/8).\n\nThe vlAURA votes are priced 2% above the last round's prices, as this market does fluctuate a lot (1 round = 2 weeks). Aave would need to control ~30,08% of the veBAL voting supply on the SM gauges to reach the target APRs shown above.\n\nThe table above demonstrates that Aura is way more interesting than Balancer without max boost. Creating the same vote incentives but farming on Balancer would not be profitable.\n\nIn this strategy, the SM depositors would earn $194,000/round ($97,000/week) in extra BAL & AURA rewards directed with votes incentives compared to AAVE tokens liquidity mining distribution.\n\nWhile the TVL max estimations are high in this proposal, this helped define the max capacity of this strategy with the current budget, evaluate the yield possibilities, and learnt the communities sentiment. However, the goal is to progressively increase the TVL target & associated votes incentives budget.\n\nThe requested amount of votes and rewards requires an active management to optimize the Quests, which is why this publication leans away from using Snapshot to determine Aave’s veBAL gauges votes and instead recommends considering different options to optimize the votes, which will be presented in the voting framework proposed in the coming days.\n\nIf the Quests are not filled, the unspent rewards can be redeemed by the DAO (minus the fees) and used for the next round. In this case, a fallback budget should be planned to temporarly compensate part of the yield in liquidity mining initially, then in GHO over time. .\n\nTo avoid this to happen, the strategy considers paying slightly more per vote than the market based on previous round price, to align the economic interest of the protocol and the voters to make sure the votes target are reached. OTC deals could also be discussed with important voters in this ecosystem.\n\n![|706x118](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/zTMjQiAa0TUwZ5MiVQPW9OROSRkoRj1XhD6LuEFdL0hK_TGp713OdJOv1R7a9SZuuWJP3Dm9wlXoPSf878NSzbr9Q9E74Yd3iwpRfNwwNc-uQjPLTwlVTK85No_OmJ3wdVjiROx1ocIh1pCauoAGGE4)\n\nThe AAVE amount spent in vote incentives in the table below is changing very often as defined by several parameters, such as the amount of votes required, the price for veBAL & vlAURA votes, the AAVE token price, the TVL in the smBPT gauges, and later on, governance updates on the SM design proposed if the budget is changed.\n\nWith the above estimations, there is a reduction of the daily LM budget, which can be accumulated as a fallback budget to avoid the unfavorable situation explained above.\n\n![|368x81](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7RQIzjSHyb9w7XIsffWS78g0smGilUe8Dco3vuymbmWPRBTak9Darub-3m7FLuDTULG17gYabPNiAoq3DDScnWkttSAJJzx7-s28LQBjBEtlSJYRWpqm0kIwyLBtwF5BUsmmfoqQuwcyTEt4PuMpH-I)\n\nAs expected, the cover cost (insurance APR) is also reduced by half, which validates the last goal of this proposal.\n\n![|515x271](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tR9EqP3W5s0SMSNuM5QnBfwq_dSnrZm3OAlylx5AAG7ExYpDgSNDLizhWMpukSfKhEEWtUw9yBxr-_xHvcBSeFkPpaLKDoFgl_7LYBO0t2Wh7TpMxxxzbN8rRhAPPE7ec-Vzh5HalS1-xsdsEZ3Lkag)\n\nThe last table in Part IV and the 2 above demonstrate that with current market metrics & estimated TVL, the APRs reached on Aura are in the range expected, as well as the average insurance cost reduction from 30,02% to 17,23% and the cover increase from $119M to $175M.\n\nAlso, considering that this strategy will help with both growing the SM (TVL & Cover) and improving the liquidity for Aave tokens, other incentive budgets for GHO liquidity or liquidity mining on StakedATokens could be used for the same strategy.\n\nActions related to the strategic voting power and votes incentives management will be defined by the framework proposal defined in part V, such as:\n\n* Lock veToken assets into Balancer and Aura to generate increased rewards.\n* Create votes incentives on Quest\n* Update the boost power, delegate or sell it on Warden if unused.\n* Vote on gauges & proposals decisions\n* Claim protocol fees\n\n# Technical Implementations:\n\n* Enable weekly distribution for Stable & Volatile BPT rewards\n* Whitelist the AAVE token on Quest as reward (No extra proposal needed)\n* Define the Aave voting framework (Part V)\n\n# Voting options:\n\nYAE - Update the incentives management strategy\nNAE - Continue classic liquidity mining\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.

        "body": "- - -\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy aCRV & CRV to veCRV\nauthor: @llamaxyz - TokenLogic & @Dydymoon \ndate: 2023.02.09\n\n- - -\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents Aave with thr options for managing the CRV holding, with @Llamaxyz recommending to lock the CRV for veCRV via Curve Finance.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAave currently holds approximately 696k CRV across Ethereum and Polygon networks. Llama has been looking at potential sources for CRV yield and governance influence. This proposal presents one high yield and one governance focused strategy for consideration:\n\nOption 1) veCRV - Lowest risk, governance and direct control CRV emissions\nOption 2) st-yCRV - High yield, no CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\nOption 3 ) sdCRV - High yield, proportional CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nTo vote NAE is to deposit CRV in Aave v3 on the network it was earned. This represents the “do nothing” approach.\n\nA Snapshot vote presenting the three options will determine which options will be presented as an AIP. Each option has varying degrees of complexity to implement, with Option 1) being the most difficult in a decentralized way, but more closely aligned with Aave’s GHO and staked aToken direction.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave currently holds 696k of CRV across Ethereum and Polygon networks. \n\nTo support Aave in choosing how best to manage the CRV holding, Llama presents three high-level strategies to choose between.\n\n## Option 1) veCRV - Lowest risk, governance and direct control CRV emissions\n\nOption 1) includes locking CRV, participating in Curve Finance governance, and voting to direct incentives to pools of Aave’s choosing. veCRV could be used to boost adoption of GHO, yield on staked aToken reserves, and yield on Protocol Owned Liquidity, to name a few potential use cases.\n\n### Pros\n\n* **Gauge weight power (Influence on CRV weekly emission)**\n\nBy locking it 4 years and relocking periodically to get the max voting power, the DAO would be able to redirect 0.0068 CRV/veCRV on the pools of its choice (Most likely directed to a GHO one) \n\nWith the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the DAO would control 4,740 CRV of emission per week, representing $234.13K per year obtained without any additional expenses. \n\n* **Protocol fees (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\n50% of all protocol fees on Curve are directed to LPs, and the other 50% goes to veCRV holders. The current APR is 3,43% which is representative of the usual economic activity. With regular volumes, the APR is close to 2-5%, but weeks like USDC depeg, the APR was 15%. \nNo extra counterparty risk (No protocol on top of Curve) \n\nUnlike the two other options, the CRV will be locked on Curve directly from the Collector contract. This reduces the risks compared to using protocols on top of Curve which adds an additional layer of smart contract counterparty risks. \n\n* **Easy management of the veCRV position & votes** \n\nRe-locking the veCRV position can be made accessible, via adding a function on the Collector Contract. Llama can then create a bot which automatically calls the function and re-commits the veCRV holding. \nThe veCRV option only requires to lock CRV, no extra token required. \n\nWhen a gauge vote is submitted on Curve, there is no need to revote each week even if the position is increased, unless Aave decides to change the vote. \n\n* **Additional features from holding veCRV** \n\nGovernance Power to participate in the DAO decisions (On-Chain)\n\nveBoost which can be sold or utilized to maximize the rewards on the funds deposited: While we agree that the impact will be minimal at first, the veBoost will grow over time with the veCRV holdings, compared to both other solutions where it is lost. \n\n### Cons\n\n* **4 unlock period with frequent relock to keep the max voting power**\n\nThe goal of this strategy is to always relock to have the maximum voting power, and increase the position over time with the CRV earned. If Aave decides to stop this strategy at a later stage, the same amount of CRV that was locked will be available after 4 years. \n\nLlama can automate the relock periodically to avoid the decay. \n\n* **Complex participation in DAO decisions**\n\nGovernance participation can be challenging with the collector contract because of the important amount of DAO decisions voted, and there is no way to delegate the veCRV governance power. \n\n## Option 2) st-yCRV - High yield, no CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes), and presents a higher-yielding investment strategy that, over time, will lead to Aave own more CRV relative to Option 1).\n\nThis option does not offer any governance influence which leads to an easier management. \n\nHowever, considering the recent events such as USDC de-peg and Euler hack which impacted many protocols, Llama believes that security should be prioritized and Aave  should proceed with the lowest risk proposal. \n\n### Pros\n\n* **Gauge weight power profits (Influence on CRV weekly emission)** \n\nWhile it’s not possible to directly vote with st-yCRV, Yearn utilizes the voting power to vote for the highest vote incentives on the market, then sells everything for CRV and compounds the strategy overtime. \n\n* **Boosted protocol fees profits (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\nYearn utilize its veCRV holdings to boost the distribution of the 3CRV (Currently 1.66x) \nAll 3CRV are collected, sold for CRV and compounded overtime.\n\n* **Temporary MegaBoost in CRV**\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this thread, Yearn decided to distribute 30k CRV/Week for a defined amount of time to maximize the yield. These CRV are also compounded in the strategy. Unless the decision is renewed, this should not be taken into account as the initial incentives should end soon. \n\n* **Easy management of the CRV position**\n\nRequires a deposit & stake to enter the strategy. The yield sources are collected in, or sold for CRV which are automatically compounded in st-yCRV. No further action is required by Aave post-staking yCRV.\n\nTotal current APR: 33%\n\n* **Transferable Asset (yCRV)** \n\nWhen CRV are deposited on Yearn, it is periodically relocked as veCRV, but the protocol mint yCRV at 1:1. These yCRV can be staked for st-yCRV and transferred or sold on the yCRV-CRV pool on Curve. \n\n### Cons\n\nNo direct governance influence** \n\nAll the gauge weight power and 3CRV are sold for CRV, and the governance power and veBoost are kept by Yearn. \n\nExtra counterparty risk (Yearn on top of Curve)** \n\nThis solution adds extra smart contract and counterparty risks as required to trust Yearn as a good manager of the strategy. \n\nHigh risk asset profile (Depeg risk)**\n\nThe yCRV is transferable, but the liquidity remains limited: $8.4M.\n \nWith the current Aave holdings and yCRV liquidity, it would be possible to exchange 680k yCRV with a rate of 0.9936:1. \n\nHowever, any selling pressure on the yCRV could lead to Aave incurring significant slippage when trying to exit the position. \n\n## Option 3) sdCRV - High yield, proportional CRV emission influence and exit liquidity risk\n\nsdCRV was proposed by the Stake DAO team in the comments, and presents as an hybrid solution between maximizing yield and governance influence. However, it requires veSDT holdings or boost delegation to Aave to be considered efficient compared to other solutions. \n\nUntil recently, the voting power on sdCRV was acquired progressively over a 30 day period. Stake DAO mentioned a parameter change related to asdcrv, but we couldn’t find any vote or public announcement about this update. However, even after this period, the voting power of 1 sdCRV was not equal to 1 veCRV if Aave does not lock SDT itself  or receive delegation from veSDT holders. \n\n## Pros\n\n* **Proportional gauge weight power (Influence on CRV weekly emission)**\n\nBy depositing 696k CRV on Stake, it would result in a voting power of 0.61 veCRV vote / sdCRV. With the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the Aave would control 2,891 CRV of emission per week, representing $142.80K per year obtained without any additional expenses or veSDT boost holdings or delegation. \n\nTo avoid a SDT acquisition and reduced voting power, Marc Zeller from ACI is to delegate all his veSDT voting power (270k) to Aave for one year, as well as relocking & re-delegating every week enabling Aave to retain the provided boost. \n\nOther parties mentioned on the forum said that they consider to delegate, but no one other than ACI confirmed that they will delegate, relock & redelegate frequently or disclosed their holdings to track the delegation, so it’s not taken into account in this recap.  \n\nAccording to AaveChan engagement, the veSDT holding delegation would boost the voting power  to 1.14x for 1 year. \n\nWith the current emission (reduced every year by 15%) the DAO would control 5,403 CRV of emission per week, representing $266.9K per year obtained with 270k veSDT boost delegated. However, as soon as the delegation is over, the voting power will be back to 0.61x. \n\n* **Proportional protocol fees (Profit sharing in 3CRV Stable pool)**\n\nSame as on Curve, the 3CRV fees are distributed to sdCRV stakers. \n\n* **Transferable Asset (sdCRV)** \n\nWhen CRV are deposited on Stake DAO, it is periodically relocked as veCRV, but the protocol mint sdCRV at 1:1. These sdCRV can be staked for sdCRV-gauge, transferred or sold on the sdCRV-CRV pool on Curve. \n\nAdditionally, the Stake DAO team communicated that the votes now operate like veCRV.  Please note, Llama has not been able to publicly find this announcement beyond this forum thread.\n\n## Cons\n\n* **Extra counterparty risk (Stake on top of Curve)**\n\nThis solution adds extra smart contracts risks, similar to st-yCRV with additional counterparty risk through reliance on ACI and/or others to provide delegated veSDT support. This veSDT support requires weekly relock and redelegation to avoid impacting the boost.\n\nAs Aave’s CRV continues to grow in line with Aave revenue, additional veSDT delegation will be required to maintain the maximum boost. Llama does not question ACI’s dedication to Aave. After the initial committed 1 year period, Aave will receive reduced voting power if an alternative veSDT delegate is not found.\n\n* **High risk asset profile (Depeg risk)** \n\nThe sdCRV is transferable, but the liquidity remains limited: $3.8M.\n\n\nWith the current Aave holdings and liquidity, it would be possible to exchange 680k sdCRV with a rate of 0.9826:1.\n\n* **Management of the rewards**\n\nConsidering that Aave will vote for pools with no vote incentives have decided on the Curve pools, Aave would not earn part of the yield disclosed on the UI. \n\n\nMoreover, all rewards from vote incentives are sold for SDT and distributed. If Aave is to accumulate a CRV holding over time, the SDT tokens would need to be swapped to CRV. \n\n* **No veBoost (Kept by Stake DAO)** \n\nSame as Yearn, Stake DAO would keep the veBoost to maximize the yield on their strategies. \n\n## NAE - aCRV on v3 Liquidity Pools\n\nTo vote NAE involves Aave holding all CRV positions in the form of aCRV.\n\nAll CRV is to be migrated/deposited into Aave v3 on the respective network and held as aCRV. In order to achieve this, CRV must first be listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. The only smart contract exposure is the Aave protocol and this strategy best represents the “do nothing” approach versus either optimizing for governance influence with yield, Option 1), or outright CRV yield, Option 2).\n\n## Comments\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating active voting power and enabling Aave to determine how to manage the position.\n\nWe are particularly interested in creating an Aave aToken liquidity pool and explore what can be done to support GHO and staked aTokens when more details emerge around those upgrades. In our opinion, Option 2) has several significant unknowns which can impact the success of the strategy.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nThe proposal with the most YAE votes will be presented as an AIP  for voting. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "This proposal aims to update the Aave DAO's Balancer ecosystem holdings by acquiring approximately 1.3M AURA tokens to maximize emission power and optimize voting power. Two main options were presented: converting remaining BPT holdings to AURA (Option 1) and acquiring AURA with stables while keeping BPT (Option 2). Option 1 leads the vote timeline analytics with strong early and overall support. The forum discussion reveals mixed sentiments with significant support for Option 1 focusing on economic optimization and increased emission power, but concerns about the impact on the Balancer partnership and complexity. Adjacent historical proposals with similar aims showed positive voting trends but some market impacts. Considering the analytics, forum sentiment, and historical lessons, the recommendation is to select Option 1 to change the current state by converting BPT to AURA for maximizing emission power and simplifying management.",
    "key_arguments_for": [
      "Maximal emission power with full vlAURA exposure and simplified management by voting on one layer only.",
      "No additional investment required as it involves converting existing BPT holdings.",
      "Enables growing liquidity on Balancer and supports the Safety Module upgrade strategy.",
      "Early and strong vote timeline support with 97% lead ratio and stability metrics favoring Option 1."
    ],
    "key_arguments_against": [
      "Option 1 may be seen as disregarding prior non-monetary partnership commitments with Balancer.",
      "Selling BPT might impact the Balancer relationship and market perception negatively.",
      "Some community members prefer to keep BPT to maintain Balancer governance influence.",
      "Complexity and risk concerns about acquiring AURA on market with low liquidity and price volatility."
