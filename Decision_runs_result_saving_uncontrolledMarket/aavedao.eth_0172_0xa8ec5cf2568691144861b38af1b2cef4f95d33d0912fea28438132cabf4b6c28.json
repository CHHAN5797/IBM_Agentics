Our methodologies are rooted in an integrative approach, offering protocol robustness and protecting funds from market risks through dynamic risk parameter recommendations. We provide a holistic approach encompassing software and services to mitigate risks in volatile markets, countering economic attacks on the protocol and ensuring the secure preservation of user funds.\n\n## Scope\n\n### **Risk Parameter Optimization**\n\nDeploying our custom agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors. Chaos Labs will thoroughly analyze the ecosystem and build custom agent-based simulations. These simulations leverage protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. Thorough system analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven optimization and risk management recommendations. \n\nCoverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.\n\n**Parameter Recommendation Platform**\n\nThe Chaos Labs Parameter Recommendation Portal is designed to provide the Aave community with a comprehensive understanding of the simulation outputs and underlying data to optimize risk parameter settings. By providing a clear and intuitive interface that highlights the impact of different parameter settings on risk and return, we can foster a more informed and engaged community, facilitating ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing. \n\nIn addition to presenting the data outputs from the Chaos Simulation Engine, the Parameter Recommendation Portal offers users unparalleled access to the underlying simulation mechanics and implications, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the simulations and their results.\n\n### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWe offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health. \n\nAs part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.\n\n### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3\n\nChaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the 'Background' section. \n\nAs we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2. \n\nGiven the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.\n\n### **Protocol Growth**\n\nChaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n\nAs we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol's expansion and sustainability.\n\n### GHO\n\nFollowing the initial launch of GHO, Chaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:\n\n- **Parameter Optimization** - we will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.\n- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.\n- **Facilitator's Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - we will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.\n- **And more**\n\n### Chaos Team Support\n\nAs part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.\n\nOur team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response.

        "author": "0x5d49dBcdd300aECc2C311cFB56593E71c445d60d",
        "body": "## Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is currently contracted to cover V3. We propose to formally expand our scope of work to cover all of Aave, including V2 and GHO. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $1.5M. \n\nWe view this expansion of work as an all-encompassing commitment and, with this, take responsibility for all Aave lending markets and financial products for the remainder of the term. Specifically, this means that there will be no further compensation increase requests, regardless of additional deployments, features, or initiatives prioritized during this time. \n\n## Background\n\nChaos’ initial engagement with Aave, starting in November 2022, focused exclusively on risk management and parameter recommendations across V3 markets ([Discussion link](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025)). In early January, prior to the launch of V3 Ethereum, the community approved a 5-month [extension](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/) of our engagement to cover V2 markets, which expired in early June 2023. Despite coverage and compensation expiring, Chaos Labs has continued to demonstrate unwavering dedication to managing V2 risk and promoting the transition to V3 while allocating significant resources.\n\nFurthermore, we have committed extensive resources to integrate V2 markets into our product suite and put forward comprehensive analyses and proposals. Given that the transition to V3 is a protracted and ongoing commitment, it remains crucial to maintain proactive risk management for V2 in the transition phase. This necessity was underscored in the recent industry-wide deliberation surrounding the CRV market. Chaos formulated a mitigation strategy now being implemented via a series of governance proposals.\n\nAs risk contributors to the protocol, we at Chaos Labs embrace an all-encompassing perspective. We view our domain of accountability and responsibility as the entire spectrum of Aave, including V2, V3 (all deployments), and the most recent launch of GHO,  as they pertain to risk, data science, parameter recommendations, analytics, and more. With this in mind, the amendment to our compensation will more accurately reflect the dedicated resources we allocate, the breadth and depth of our commitment, and the tangible value we provide to Aave. \n\n## **Scope:**\n\nAs outlined in the background section, the scope of our work is expansive, encompassing every element related to market risk throughout the Aave protocol. Below, we highlight the core components of our engagement:\n\n### V2+V3\n\n- **Risk Parameter Optimization** - Deploying our agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors.\n- **Risk Monitoring and Alerting** - We offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations.\n- **Protocol Growth** -  We provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n- **Incident Response and Ongoing Market Impact Analysis -**  We maintain an active role in incident response, ready to react promptly and effectively in the event of any market anomalies or security incidents.

        "body": "## Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $2M.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn November 2023, Chaos Labs’ engagement with Aave DAO was [unanimously renewed](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/360/), underscoring our ongoing commitment and the expanded scope of our engagement with Aave, which has evolved significantly with Aave's expansion now across over 10 deployments.\n\nThis renewal was done during the bear market, prompting us to propose a community-friendly deal at a lower-than-market cost, given the challenging market conditions and being mindful of the broader economic environment. This was aligned with the feedback from major Aave stakeholders and delegates. However, the expansion of Aave to multiple chains, in addition to the increased volatility and activity across DeFi and crypto, has significantly increased our scope and workload, necessitating additional resources to maintain the high level of service required. \n\nAs dedicated risk contributors, Chaos Labs adopts a holistic approach to managing the spectrum of responsibilities within Aave's ecosystem, including V3, GHO, and the continued offboarding of V2. Our commitment encompasses risk management, data science, analytics, and parameter recommendation, among other critical functions. An amendment to our compensation is essential to reflect better the resources committed, the depth of our engagement, and the substantial value we bring to the Aave community.\n\nConsidering improved market conditions and Aave’s growth over the past several months, we believe the DAO is now in a position to revise our compensation to more accurately reflect the current scale and impact of our engagement and allocated resources.\n\n### Enhancing Aave's Risk Management Framework\n\nThe proposed compensation amendment is not merely a financial adjustment but a continued investment in our collaboration. With additional funding, Chaos Labs will be poised to:\n\n- **Deploy Additional Resources:** Enhance support for existing and future Aave markets, ensuring comprehensive risk management across all deployments.\n- **Develop and Optimize Risk Oracles:** Focus efforts on the continued development of the Chaos Risk Oracle specifically for Aave’s needs, enabling more efficient and dynamic risk parameter adjustments. This will further streamline the risk management process, reducing the need for manual interventions and significantly boosting the protocol's operational efficiency and security.\n- **Expansion of Risk Monitoring and Alerts:** Our real-time monitoring and alert services are delivered via the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). We're committed to enriching these services with more comprehensive analytics and alerts, enhancing visibility and enabling users to meticulously evaluate ecosystem risks and the health of the protocol through intuitive dashboards and data visualizations. The deployment of Risk Oracles will introduce additional data, providing the community with an improved grasp of risk levels and updates to protocol parameters.\n\n### Collaborative Expansion with a Second Risk Service Provider\n\nFollowing Gauntlet's resignation as the second-risk service provider, we strongly support the idea of bringing on another service provider to complement our existing scope of work. As part of our engagement, we are committed to dedicating the required resources to assist with the onboarding process and ongoing collaborations, ensuring a seamless integration that enhances Aave's risk management capabilities without duplicating efforts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe requested compensation amendment is key for Chaos Labs to sustain and expand its support for Aave. It will enable us to allocate additional resources effectively, develop innovative solutions like the Risk Oracle, and continue our mission to enhance Aave's security and efficiency. We are committed to our partnership with Aave and believe that with the community's support, we can continue setting the standards for risk management in the industry.\n\n## Specification:\n\nWe request an additional $400K for the remainder of our current engagement, bringing the total annual compensation to $2M. \n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 400,000 aUSDC or GHO. \n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and more. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP).\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

We will achieve this through thoughtful and deep quantitative and qualitative analysis, community engagement and empowerment, and promoting a culture of transparency and collaboration. By integrating these principles into our approach, we envision a future where Aave sets new industry standards for risk management and operational excellence, driving sustainable growth and securing user trust across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## Our Values\n\n**Impactful Contribution:** Allez Labs prioritizes areas where our expertise can significantly enhance the protocol's stability and growth. Through strategic focus and dedicated effort, we believe that our work can lead to substantial improvements, driving Aave towards achieving its full potential in the DeFi landscape. Our roadmap adapts based on the most pressing needs of the DAO, and where we can have the greatest impact.\n\n**Community-Centric Innovation:** Our approach to risk management is deeply rooted in serving the community. We utilize transparent, robust methodologies to deliver risk recommendations that are both effective and intuitive, reflecting the dynamic nature of DeFi markets and the needs of the DAO. Allez Labs is committed to democratizing access to risk insights, offering the community tools and reports that require deep expertise and data to build yet are accessible to the wider community. By focusing on clarity, we will empower the community with the knowledge needed for sound decision-making, thereby contributing to a more resilient and vibrant Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Transparency:** We champion transparency as a pillar of the DeFi ecosystem. By fostering the development and adoption of transparent methodologies, such as open sourcing code and frameworks, we aim to create a culture of mutual growth and innovation. This philosophy is rooted in our belief that progress in the DeFi space is a collective journey, propelled by shared knowledge and collaboration.\n\n**Empowering Autonomy:** Central to our ethos is the goal of minimizing dependency on any single service provider, including ourselves. We envision a future where the Aave DAO is equipped with the knowledge and tools to independently manage risk. To this end, we are dedicated to open-sourcing our data pipelines and models, ensuring that our contributions have a lasting impact and support the DAO's journey towards self-reliance. Our objective is clear: to build a foundation that not only serves immediate needs but also empowers future generations of the Aave community.\n\n## Our approach as a risk provider\n\nOur focus is on providing clear, actionable risk management insights that enhance understanding of the interplay between growth opportunities and potential risks. Through transparent methodologies and open communication, we commit to empowering the Aave DAO with the knowledge needed for informed decision-making, thereby fostering a proactive, risk-aware community.\n\nOur mission is aligned with the evolving priorities of the Aave DAO and its stakeholders. Whether the focus shifts towards GHO, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), or other areas of interest, Allez Labs is dedicated to adapting our resources to meet these needs. By maintaining a flexible approach, we ensure that while we concentrate on the DAO's current priorities, we also keep a vigilant eye on the broader risk landscape. Our goal is to provide targeted, relevant contributions that not only address immediate concerns but also strengthen Aave's resilience and strategic position in the long term.\n\n# Proposal\n\nAllez Labs proposes to partner with Aave DAO, leveraging our extensive experience in risk management and our commitment to open-source principles to enhance the protocol's stability and growth across Aave V3 and GHO. Our mission is to protect Aave from a broad spectrum of risks through employing a holistic strategy that not only focuses on mitigating immediate threats through qualitative and quantitative modeling, but also on embedding long-term risk management solutions into the protocol's design. With a focus on transparency, community engagement, and open-source development, we pledge to empower the Aave community with the knowledge and tools necessary for informed decision-making, fostering a more robust, inclusive, and thriving ecosystem.\n\n## Scope\n\n**Aave V3**\n\n* **Asset Listing Support:** We will provide analysis for new asset listings on all V3 markets for all assets that pass the Temp Check stage.\n* **New Deployment Risk Assessments:** Aave V3 is now active on 10 chains and we anticipate the DAO will vote to explore additional networks in the upcoming year. As such, we will provide market risk and liquidity assessments for new deployment proposals as well as initial assets and parameterizations for these new networks.\n* **Ad Hoc Parameter Recommendations:** Recognizing Chaos Labs' effective and proactive adjustments to market parameters, Allez Labs will offer supplementary analyses and strategic recommendations for V3 market parameters, targeting enhanced ecosystem stability and refined risk management.\n* **LRT Listing Framework:** As Liquid Restaking Tokens become increasingly popular, Allez Labs will create and publish a LRT listing framework with support from the greater Aave community to best onboard and manage these assets within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**GHO**\n\n* **Aave V3 Facilitator Parameterization:** This includes parameter recommendations to manage market and liquidity risks, while ensuring GHO’s competitiveness. Parameters to be tuned are borrow cap, interest rates, and stkAAVE discounts.\n* **GHO Peg Stability:** Our team will develop strategies to minimize peg volatility and drive GHO growth through renewed trust in GHO’s stability, allowing for increased GHO borrow caps. We will work with the GHO Liquidity Committee to supply relevant GHO peg analysis and data.\n* **GSM Parameterization:** Adjust the GHO Stability Module parameters to most effectively support GHO’s peg.\n* **Support Cross-Chain GHO Rollout:** Allez Labs will conduct analyses to assess and mitigate risks associated with the cross-chain expansion of GHO, guided by the initiative and framework set by Aave Labs.\n\n**Protocol**\n\n* **Risk Steward:** Take on the role as the second service provider on the risk steward multistig.\n* **Incident Response:** As needed, when emergency security threats arise, we will provide guidance, threat and impact analyses in order to mitigate the threats.\n* **Automated Risk Management:** We will work with other risk providers and stakeholders to begin development of risk parameter automation strategies to streamline the DAO’s risk process where the trade offs are clear. These may include:\n  * Automation around WETH interest rate parameters which are primarily driven by LST yield\n  * Automation around Supply and Borrow caps for new deployments\n\n### Roadmap\n\n* **Immediate:** Ad hoc risk parameter recommendations for V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche markets, support for GHO related items, assume risk stewardship responsibilities, new deployment risk assessments.\n* **Short-Term Objectives (First 3 Months):** Active risk parameter recommendations on GHO and all remaining active V3 markets, support for GSM parameterization and remaining GHO items. Risk analysis work for cross-chain GHO.\n* **Med-Term Objectives (Following 3 Months):** Automated risk management development report, LRT listing framework publication.\n\n### Requested Budget\n\nFor the operations of Allez Labs over a 6-month period a budget of $400,000 is proposed. This budget will enable us to cover operational costs including, but not limited:\n\n* Legal fees\n* Node and data provider subscriptions\n* Cloud costs\n* Salaries, and hiring of additional analysts and developers as needed\n\n### Terms\n\n* 6-month engagement\n* 400,000 GHO streamed linearly throughout the engagement\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\n\nFrom the DAO’s experience with service providers, inspired by BGDs proposal, the following metrics are good measures of performance:\n\n* Monthly recaps of Allez Labs’ contributions to the DAO with tracking of the progress on the scope and various contributions.\n* Provable participation and/or delivery of the projects described in the scope.\n* Direct or indirect participation in projects of other fields of contribution.\n* Feedback from other contributors and DAO members.\n* Direct and transparent engagement with the DAO via this governance forum.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Engage with the community and other service provides to refine the proposal\n2. Escalate the proposal strengthened by stakeholders’ feedback to ARFC\n3. Execution upon approval\n4. Immediate support for GHO, Aave V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism and Avalanche.\n5.

With a proven track record of thorough risk analysis, an unbiased approach, and an unwavering commitment to the success of our partner protocols, we have earned the trust and endorsement of those we work with.\n\nLlamaRisk was established in 2021 as a service to Curve DAO and its LPs, providing risk transparency analyses of assets listed on Curve, including stablecoins, RWAs (Real World Assets), LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens), and LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens). In 2023, we partnered with Prisma Finance to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing LST collateral risk, which we have used to produce detailed analyses for onboarding assets onto the protocol. We have since expanded our suite of risk management solutions with agent-based simulations and DeFi strategy management.\n\n### Motivation\n\nLlamaRisk is a DeFi-native risk firm that understands the delicate balance protocols face to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape without sacrificing responsible, sustainable practices. \n\nOur core values are transparency and accountability. When armed with reliable and objective information, DAOs and their users are equipped to take action in their best interest. Therefore, our duty is to consistently demonstrate sound reasoning based on thorough analysis that our partners have come to depend on.\n\nLlamaRisk has distinguished itself through:\n\n- **Long-form Comprehensive Risk Analysis:** Over the last two years, we have published over 70 long-form risk assessments in the public domain. Our procedures and QA/QC processes ensure we present clear, unbiased information.\n- **Governance & Parameterization Recommendation:** We have a longstanding history of providing consultation for our risk analyses. Our detailed reports, along with a hands-on approach, have informed critical decisions within our partner DAOs.\n- **Diversity of DeFi Knowledge:** Our team understands many protocol architectures, especially concerning stablecoins, liquid staking derivatives, and pegged assets generally. This knowledge comes from extensive research, development, and hands-on experience with various DeFi protocols, enabling us to anticipate and mitigate risks effectively.\n- C**ommitment to Innovation:** At LlamaRisk, we continually evolve our methodologies and tools to stay at the forefront of DeFi research and risk management, ensuring our strategies are effective.\n\n### Specification\n\nRecognizing the significance of a dual risk provider model, LlamaRisk's proposal is designed to complement Chaos Labs' risk services, with whom we plan to collaborate extensively. \n\nThe initial 6-month engagement, which may be extended pending DAO approval, involves the following scope:\n\n- **On-demand Risk Assessments:** LlamaRisk will deliver prompt and in-depth risk assessments for assets listed or considered to be listed on Aave with particular emphasis on the collateral types comprising the GHO stablecoin. This will involve developing a custom framework tailored specifically to the categories of relevant assets and Aave's needs, which will standardize the assessment process.\n- **Collaborative Engagement with Chaos Labs:** We plan to collaborate extensively with Chaos Labs, combining our expertise to provide Aave with comprehensive and nuanced risk analysis, enhancing the protocol's risk management capacity.\n- **Active Involvement in DAO Governance:** LlamaRisk will actively participate in Aave's DAO governance, offering informed insights and strategic recommendations on risk management practices for principal stakeholders and the community.\n- **Legal Regulatory Advisory and Policy Work:** We will offer specialized legal research and regulatory guidance, including a thorough analysis of evolving legal frameworks and regulatory policies, and equip Aave with the necessary foresight to navigate the regulatory landscape of the DeFi sector effectively.\n\nRisk vectors are diverse and cannot be fully managed by qualitative risk tools. That is why we specialize in comprehensive risk assessment of tokenized assets and DeFi protocols. Our work supports our partners in making informed decisions that mitigate potential threats and promote a culture of transparency and sustainability. Our team of experts meticulously evaluate various risk factors, including but not limited to:\n\n- Protocol design and architecture\n- Tokenomics and economic incentives\n- Smart contract security\n- Governance mechanisms\n- Regulatory compliance\n\nLlamaRisk leverages advanced simulation techniques, including statistical and agent-based modeling, to test and validate DeFi protocols and their collateral assets under various stress scenarios. Our simulations provide valuable insights into potential risks, allowing our partner protocols to set competitive parameters resilient to adverse market conditions.\n\nOur DeFi strategy managers employ data analytics and risk monitoring tools that allow us to maintain high efficiency and safety standards. We support our partners with publications and dashboards that give users the information they need to interact with the protocol responsibly.\n\nOur advisory services cater to the unique needs of DeFi projects, providing strategic guidance and support throughout their lifecycle. From ideation to implementation, our experienced advisors offer expert advice on protocol design, tokenomics, governance, and risk management strategies, ensuring optimal outcomes for our partners.\nComment\n\nTraversing the complex regulatory landscape is crucial for DeFi protocols and projects. Our team of legal experts provides in-depth analysis and guidance to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate legal risks, assist with regulatory filings, and help clients develop robust strategies for operating within the evolving regulatory framework.\n\nWe actively engage in policy development and legislative processes related to crypto and blockchain at national, supranational, and international levels. This includes participating in specialized working groups, contributing opinions to public discussions on regulatory developments, and involvement in policymaking dialogues. We aim to ensure that DeFi stakeholders are represented and protected in the evolving regulatory landscape, facilitating informed and proactive responses to legislative changes.\n\n### Duration & Proposed Budget\n\nWe propose a flexible retainer model for our collaboration, with an initial 6-month commitment. This model is designed to ensure maximum efficiency in resource utilization, with a commitment to transparency and responsible financial management.\n\nThe budget request is $250,000 for a 6-month engagement.\n\nDetailed quarterly reports on our spending will be provided, with any unused funds either carried over to the next quarter or returned to the Aave DAO, as preferred.\n\nOverall, this proposed scope is an opportunity for LlamaRisk to demonstrate its ability to make an appreciable improvement in Aave's risk management, which is a pragmatic and cost-effective onboarding strategy. It also serves as an introduction to building a working relationship with Chaos Labs and DAO stakeholders. We intend to demonstrate our value throughout a 6-month engagement and expand our suite of services as pain points are identified. \n\nWe are a flexible and agile team ready to work together to provide risk management solutions that will suit Aave's specific needs within the wider organization of service providers and stakeholders making up the DAO.\n\n### Useful Links\n\nYou can find in this section links to our work:\n\n- [Curve Gauge Risk Substack](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/) (CryptoRisk Assessments): We publicize research related to assets with Curve pools (mostly stablecoins and RWAs) with attention to risks to the Curve gauge and governance system\n- [PrismaRisk Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@PrismaRisk): We publicize comprehensive collateral risk assessments for proposed collateral assets on Prisma Finance (LSTs and LRTs)\n- [LlamaRisk Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk): We publicize comprehensive collateral risk assessments for potential collateral assets for Curve crvUSD\n- ArcadiaSim: [Update 1](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation),  [Update 2](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-d98), [Update 3](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-388), [Update 4](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-42d) & [Update 5](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-3fa)\n- [Sturdy Finance crvUSD Aggregator](https://v2.sturdy.finance/aggregators/ethereum/0x73E4C11B670Ef9C025A030A20b72CB9150E54523/deposit): Sturdy V2 app of the aggregator managed by LlamaRisk\n- [Aggregator Dune Dash](https://dune.com/llamarisk/sturdy-crvusd-aggregator-monitoring): LlamaRisk dashboard monitoring the aggregator and underlying assets\n- [Aggregator Oracle Explainer](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/sturdy-finance-crvusd-aggregator): Publication on Sturdy silos Oracle design\n- [Response to FCA Discussion Paper DP23/4](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/llama-risk-response-to-fca-discussion): Our response to the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Discussion Paper on Regulating Cryptoassets Phase 1: Stablecoins\n- [DeFi Yield Optimizers](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/llama-legal-defi-yield-optimizers): The legal status of DeFi yield optimizers under the EU crypto regulatory framework\n- [SubDAO Legal Entity Formation](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/subdao-legal-entity-formation): Llama Risk resources for DAO sub-orgs in search of suitable legal structures\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
