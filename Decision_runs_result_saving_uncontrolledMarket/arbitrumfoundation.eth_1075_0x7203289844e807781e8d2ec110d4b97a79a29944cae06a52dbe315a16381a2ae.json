Included in this transition were:\n\nControl of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\nControl over the DAO treasury\nControl over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\nAll Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\nAbility to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\nFull responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\nThe DAO has full control of the resources of the DAO treasury.\n\nThough it is acknowledged that there is nuance in the chicken and egg problem, the DAO undeniably has the right to reverse any decisions made unilaterally by the foundation or the service provider.\n\nWhen the public on medium distribution was released, it marked the creation of the DAO.\n\nIn the prospectus, it was clearly outlined that the DAO would receive 42.78% of the token supply\n\nThe legal rationale behind the decision from the service provider to not initially allocate resources to the foundation is not clear, but what is done is done.\n\nOnce public communication is disseminated and people make investment decisions based on the terms of decentralization, that is binding and there is no going back.\n\nThe Foundation has unilaterally been allocated $750M tokens from the DAO that was not approved by the governance token holders.\n\nAny funds must be returned until it has been properly allocated by the DAO and the DAO only.\n\nHealth of the Foundation\n\nWe understand that the Foundation needs resources for the ecosystem to succeed and compete versus its competitors.\n\nWe are in support of AIP1.1 and AIP 1.2 as proposed.\n\nIt is prudent that full faith and trust be restored in the governance process before we proceed with anything else.\n\nAsk\nReturn 700M $ARB from the Foundation to the DAO as a symbolic gesture that the governance token holders hold ultimate power and authority over the resources that were granted to the DAO\n\nBuyback $ARB via Wintermute with whatever fiat is left from the $10M OTC sale\n\nDisclose terms of the market making deal with Wintermute\n\nPause AIP 1.1 and 1.2",

The ArbitrumDAO Constitution, located at https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company, which will serve the ArbitrumDAO community and be governed by it, aims to foster the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the ability to submit Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (“**AIPs**”), vote on them and make them a reality through The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nThe guiding values of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO are described in Section 5 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and are incorporated herein.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation serves the ArbitrumDAO by administering the wishes of the community and otherwise adhering to its guiding values. The Arbitrum Foundation and DAO governance are intended to serve as vehicles enabling impactful, transparent and fair decentralized governance by the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThrough the submission of AIPs, the ArbitrumDAO will be able to collectively decide and effectuate changes ranging from core protocol technology to non-technical decisions that otherwise impact the community and $ARB tokenholders.\n\n\n### Specifications\n\n**Governance powers breakdown**\n\n**1. $ARB Tokenholders**\n\n* $ARB tokenholders, who make up the ArbitrumDAO, play the most critical role in the proper functioning of decentralized governance in the pursuit of a trustless, transparent and verifiable Arbitrum ecosystem. As Arbitrum is intended to be a public good, it is only right that governance over it should be governed by those for whom such public good is intended for.\n\n* $ARB tokenholders have the ability to directly propose, vote on and effectuate on-chain AIPs with respect to the ArbitrumDAO-approved chains.\n\n\n**2. Special Grants**\n\n* The Arbitrum Foundation shall be permitted to issue grants out of the Administrative Budget Wallet without undergoing a full on-chain AIP process (such grants, “**Special Grants**”).\n\n* The rationale behind the ability of The Arbitrum Foundation to issue Special Grants is to avoid inundating governance with grant applications, while at the same time alleviating voter fatigue.\n\n* The Special Grants application process and criteria will be released at a later date by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n\n**3. Directors**\n\nAs a Cayman Islands foundation, The Arbitrum Foundation is required to have at least 1 director responsible for the management and operation of The Arbitrum Foundation, in particular approving and entering into contractual arrangements on behalf of The Arbitrum Foundation (i.e., the parties actually approving and signing agreements).|\n\nThe directors are responsible for ensuring that AIPs do not:\n\n* Compromise their fiduciary duties owed to The Arbitrum Foundation;\n* Violate The Arbitrum Foundation’s Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association or bylaws, the ArbitrumDAO Constitution, the AIP Process or any other laws or regulations of applicable jurisdictions (including but not limited to Cayman Islands laws); and \n* Cause The Arbitrum Foundation to be in breach or violation of any contracts, agreements or any other arrangements.\n\nThe initial directors of The Arbitrum Foundation are: \n* Campbell Law, \n* Edward Noyons and \n* Ani Banerjee\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may remove or elect The Arbitrum Foundation’s directors or expand or reduce the number of directors at any time pursuant to a Non-Constitutional AIP\n\n**4.\tSecurity Council**\nThe Security Council is a committee of 12 members of a multi-sig wallet which has the ability to perform both Emergency and Non-Emergency Actions, which are further detailed in Section 3 of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe initial Security Council members, split by cohort, are as follows:\n\ni.\tSeptember Cohort\n1.\t[Mo Dong](https://twitter.com/no89thkey) is the Co-Founder of Celer Network.

Data Availability Committee (Arbitrum Nova chain only)**\n\nTransactions occurring on the Arbitrum Nova chain are settled on Ethereum mainnet, but, unlike transactions occurring on the Arbitrum One chain, the underlying transaction data batches are posted and stored by the members of the Data Availability Committee on a [Data Availability Server](https://developer.arbitrum.io/das/daserver-instructions) (and not on Ethereum mainnet).\n\nThe initial members of the Data Availability Committee are authorized representatives of the following parties:\n* Reddit, Inc.\n* ConsenSys Software Inc.\n* QuikNode, Inc.\n* P2P Business Technologies\n* Google Cloud ( Google LLC.)\n* Offchain Labs, Inc.\n* Opensea Innovation Labs Private Limited\n\n\nData Availability Committee members can be appointed and removed at any time pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO. In the event that a Data Availability Committee member is removed (and not otherwise replaced) pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO, or in the event that a Data Availability Committee member resigns without a replacement, the Security Council may execute an emergency action (9-of-12 approval required) to appoint a replacement for such removed or resigned Data Availability Committee member.\n\n### AIP Guidelines and Process Breakdown\n\nSection 2 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution lays out the AIP process and voting procedures, as well as the various categories of AIPs, and is incorporated herein.\n\n**Arbitrum Voting Protocol Procedure**\n\n1. [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) will act as the initial on-chain voting platform for the ArbitrumDAO to submit and vote on AIPs\n\n2. Tally will serve as a front-end user interface that allows DAO members to do several things, namely:\n*   Create AIPs;\n*   View delegates and their voting share;\n*   Re-delegate votes to a different delegate;\n*   View current and past AIPs;\n*   Vote on AIPs on-chain, interacting with the on-chain governance contracts via the Tally front-end; and\n*   View the status of AIP execution during all voting stages\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n1. Ratification of formation of The Arbitrum Foundation and its [Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MLHbkvCgbP9grygn6YfxxM9oA_T1mEK-aYDD7nRA04/edit?usp=sharing) and [bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkV8IC-TXQFjPZn5_IJGb2wjlxNTjDZXK3cCzoF8hqM/edit?usp=sharing) linked in this AIP-1.\n2. Ratification of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)\n3. Ratification of Security Council and Data Availability Committee member appointments and respective powers\n4. Ratification of the following allocations of the L2 basefee on the Arbitrum Nova chain: 8% of the basefee to the Data Availability Committee and 12% of the basefee to Arbitrum Nova validators\n5. Ratification of the funding of the DAO Treasury (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution)\n6. Approval of the AIP process as described in this AIP-1\n7. Completed setup of the [Arbitrum ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation)[Forum](http://forum.arbitrum.io), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) and [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum)\n8. Ratification of funding the Administrative Budget Wallet\n9. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Overall Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n**Timeline**\n\nSolution prepared and ready to be ratified and approved\n\n**Overall Costs**\n\n**Initial Setup Costs of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO**\n\nTotal setup costs, including legal costs, DAO administration setup and registration fees to be reimbursed to service providers:  $3.5 million (“**Total Setup Costs**”)\n\n**DAO Treasury**\nIn order to best provide the ArbitrumDAO with the ability to effectively govern and foster the development of Governed Chains (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution), 3,527,046,079 $ARB tokens have been transferred to the DAO Treasury. The ArbitrumDAO will have direct on-chain governance powers over the DAO Treasury in accordance with the AIP process as delineated in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution.\n\n\n**The Arbitrum Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet**\n\nFor the sake of operational and administrative efficiency, a separate account controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation will be created (“**Administrative Budget Wallet**”). 750 million $ARB tokens will be transferred to the Administrative Budget Wallet for purposes of making Special Grants, reimbursing applicable service providers for the Total Setup Costs and covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation. Further funding of the Administrative Budget Wallet shall require approval of an AIP by the ArbitrumDAO pursuant to the AIP process.\n\n[The Arbitrum Foundation Memorandum of Association](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MLHbkvCgbP9grygn6YfxxM9oA_T1mEK-aYDD7nRA04)\n\n[The Arbitrum Foundation Bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkV8IC-TXQFjPZn5_IJGb2wjlxNTjDZXK3cCzoF8hqM/edit?usp=sharing)",
