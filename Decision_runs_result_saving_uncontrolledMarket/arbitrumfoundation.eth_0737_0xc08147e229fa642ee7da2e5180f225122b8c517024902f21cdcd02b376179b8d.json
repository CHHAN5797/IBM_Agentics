        "title": "[Constitutional] AIP: Remove Cost Cap on Arbitrum Nova",
        "author": "0xd333Bc5c9670C9cEb18f9A2CF02C6E86807a8227",
        "body": "Note: this proposal will be subject to an individual Snapshot vote; if it reaches a quorum of 3% of votable $ARB, it may be combined with several other maintenance-related proposals for a joint Tally vote.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal will remove the Amortized Cost Cap, which is expected to result in higher gas fees for users on Arbitrum Nova. This increase is necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of the network and reduce the financial burden on the Arbitrum Foundation. Given the diminishing relevance of Nova and the evolving Layer 2 landscape, lifting this cap will prevent inefficiencies and unnecessary constraints on network operations.\n\n# Motivation\n\nArbitrum Nova was initially positioned as a cost-efficient alternative to Arbitrum One, offering 30-50x cheaper transaction fees at launch. However, several developments have significantly reduced Nova’s competitive advantage:\n\n* EIP-4844 blobs: The introduction of EIP-4844 significantly reduced the cost difference between Nova and Arbitrum One, from 30-50x to a mere 2x. This difference is negligible given the already low costs on Arbitrum One.\n* Orbit adoption: Orbit chains have become a more attractive option for teams seeking gas sponsorship and customization. Their ease of deployment has led many teams to prefer Orbit chains over Nova.\n\nGiven the now-minimal cost advantage over Arbitrum One and the rise of Orbit chains, maintaining an amortized cost cap on Nova — which currently prevents batch posters from recovering full L1 costs — is no longer justifiable. Removing the cap will stop the Arbitrum Foundation from subsidizing these subsidies and align cost recovery with actual usage.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe continued enforcement of an amortized cost cap on Nova introduces inefficiencies that do not align with its current usage patterns and network activity. This setting limits the percentage of L1 posting costs that batch posters can recover from the chain (denominated in basis points, or bips, where 10000 = 100%). Currently, the cap prevents full cost recovery, forcing the Arbitrum Foundation to subsidize the difference. Removing the cap (i.e., setting it to 0 bips) would:\n\n* Ensure batch posters are able to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n* Eliminate recurring deficits currently paid by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n* Reflect Nova’s lower strategic priority within the broader Arbitrum roadmap.\n\nHistorical data on Arbitrum Nova batch poster deficits can be seen [here](https://app.hex.tech/8bb08a30-5c58-48c4-acb0-5a0515db9db2/app/0196afd6-bf44-7001-bbb9-c429e3920ca8/latest). ​This data highlights the ongoing inefficiencies and justifies the removal of the amortized cost cap.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Amortized Cost Cap (setAmortizedCostCapBips): A parameter within the ArbOwner system contract that limits the percentage of Layer 1 transaction posting costs that batch posters are allowed to recover from the network. Expressed in basis points (bips), where 10000 = 100%.\n* ArbOwner Contract: A privileged precompiled contract that allows the ArbitrumDAO to configure core protocol settings, such as the amortized cost cap.\n* EIP-4844: An Ethereum Improvement Proposal introducing blob-carrying transactions. Its implementation has significantly reduced the cost disparity between Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum One, undermining the original economic rationale for Nova’s fee model.\n* Batch poster transactions: Transactions that aggregate multiple operations and submit them as a single on-chain transaction. With the enforced fee cap, these transactions become less cost-effective under current network dynamics, contributing to operational inefficiencies.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe DAO will execute a call to the [ArbOwner contract](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts/blob/c32af127fe6a9124316abebbf756609649ede1f5/src/precompiles/ArbOwner.sol#L129C14-L129C37) on Arbitrum Nova to set the amortizedCostCapBips value to 0, thereby allowing batch posters to recover 100% of their L1 posting costs.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nMore detailed information about the specific implementation will be provided closer to the date of the formal on-chain Tally vote.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe following timeline outlines proposed milestones from initial discussions to full implementation. Adjustments may be made based on community feedback and DAO governance requirements.\n\n1. May 29th: AIP forum post outlining the proposed modification to Arbitrum Nova\n2. June 19th: Temperature check held on Snapshot\n3. July/August: Should the temperature check pass, as specified above, it will be included in the AIP draft combining several other maintenance-related proposals for a joint Tally vote.\n4. On-chain Tally vote: Will commence once all other maintenance-related proposals have passed the respective temperature checks on Snapshot.\n5. Post-on-chain Tally vote: Should the Tally vote pass, the waiting period on L2 will last 1 week after Tally vote is finalized, after which, the removal of amortized cost cap will be executed on Arbitrum Nova.\n6. Post-implementation monitoring & reporting: A public dashboard will be continuously maintained and updated with new data, from 1-month after the removal of the amortized cost cap.",

        "body": "## Abstract\nThe Nova Fee Sweep action applies to historical Nova transaction fees currently held in the [L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a); these fees will be swept into the DAO Treasury with the use of the modernized fee collection infrastructure outlined in the [Nova Fee Router Proposal](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65). The full balance of ETH–currently 1,885 ETH–will be transferred to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One using established smart contract infrastructure.\n\nThere will be an upcoming AIP which combines both the Timeboost AIP and the Nova Fee Sweep action AIP into a single proposal for an on-chain vote on Tally. If the on-chain vote on Tally passes successfully, Timeboost will be enabled on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova and the Nova Fee Sweep action will be executed. This temperature check serves as a way for the DAO to explicitly approve for the fees from the historical [L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) to the [ChildToParentRouter](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code).\n\n## Motivation\nHistorically, Nova transaction fees accumulated to the [L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) address, which required a lengthy constitutional proposal process for the ArbitrumDAO to access or spend. The successful passing of the [Nova Fee Router proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) redirected these fees to a system of \"fee routers\" that automatically transfers funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury, reducing quorum requirements, reducing delays, and simplifying accounting by consolidating funds directly in the treasury. As of 28 August 2024, Nova transaction fees began accumulating to a series of RewardDistributor contracts as outlined in the Nova Fee Router proposal, streamlining the revenue collection process for the DAO.\n\nHowever, transaction fees that accumulated to the L1TimelockAlias *before* the Nova Fee Router change went into effect remain in the L1TimelockAlias, totalling 1,885.79 ETH. This proposal intends to sweep these historical Nova transaction fees from the legacy L1TimelockAlias address into the new fee collection system. This will be a one-time task because funds collected after 28 August 2024 have been, and will continue to be, automatically forwarded through the new fee collection system to the ArbitrumDAO treasury.\n\n## Key Terms\n[L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a): address that historically accumulated Nova transaction fees but was replaced by RewardDistributor contracts as a part of the [Nova Fee Router Proposal](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x4ad37b12ffe5c334e0c19113ac54222983e18d36a255fbde60e483592f35fc65) to upgrade the fee collection infrastructure; historical fees held by this address are the subject of this proposal. \n\n[ChildToParentRouter](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code): smart contract that, when called, creates an L2-to-L1 message which sends the contract’s full ETH balance; once the message is executed, the ETH is transferred to a ParentToChildRouter smart contract on L1\n\n[ParentToChildRouter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40cd7d713d7ae463f95ce5d342ea6e7f5cf7c999#code): smart contract that, when called, creates a retryable ticket which transfers the contract’s full ETH balance from L1 to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One\n\nThe full script for executing the Nova Fee Sweep can be found here: [Standalone Nova Fee Sweep Proposal #303](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/303)\n\n## Steps to Implement\nThe script will be included alongside the onchain AIP which proposes for the adoption of Timeboost on Tally. Since both changes are bundled into one onchain AIP, this temperature check serves as a way for the DAO to explicitly approve for the fees from the historical [L1TimelockAlias](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951d92b0c345144506576ec13ecf5103ac905a) to the [ChildToParentRouter](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x36d0170d92f66e8949eb276c3ac4fea64f83704d#code).\n\nOnce transaction fees are received by the ChildToParentRouter, the automated fee collection process will be activated, forwarding fees to the [ParentToChildRouter](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40cd7d713d7ae463f95ce5d342ea6e7f5cf7c999#code) on L1 and eventually to the [DAO Treasury](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf3fc178157fb3c87548baa86f9d24ba38e649b58) on Arbitrum One; complete implementation details for this automated fee routing can be found in the [preceding Tally proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616). Please note that Reward Distributor contracts are irrelevant for this particular action as historical fees from the L1TimelockAlias will be transferred directly to the ChildToParentRouter.\n\n## Resources and Timelines:\n[Timeboost + Nova Fee Sweep AIP forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-timeboost-nova-fee-sweep/28247) \nNova Fee Sweep Snapshot: 30 Jan - 6 Feb\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will communicate a tentative date for the creation of the onchain AIP in the near future.",

Callisto adds support for relevant Execution Layer (EL) changes from Ethereum’s upcoming [Pectra upgrade](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7600) (H1 2025) and a small Arbitrum Stylus related fix. Among the EL changes include a way for Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to execute smart contract code directly from their addresses (via [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)) and new pre-compiles to efficiently perform operations over the BLS12-381 elliptic curve, including those for BLS signature verification (via [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)).\n\nWhile the goal of the proposed ArbOS 40 “Callisto” upgrade is to eventually be available for adoption by any Arbitrum Chain, this proposal only concerns the Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova chains, as these two chains are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level, an ArbOS upgrade can be interpreted as Arbitrum’s equivalent of a hard fork - more can be read about the subject over in Arbitrum ArbOS upgrades [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695).\n\nPlease note that ArbOS Version 40 “Callisto” is a proposed upgrade that builds upon ArbOS version 32 which has been previously adopted by the ArbitrumDAO - this proposal increments the version number to 40 instead of 33 due to technical details that allow for better Orbit chain customizability as explained [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/how-tos/arbos-upgrade#step-3-schedule-the-arbos-version-upgrade).\n\n## Changes that will be included in ArbOS 40 Callisto:\n\n### [EIP-7702: Set EOA Account code ](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)\n\nEIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to set executable code adding account-abstraction functionality to EOAs such as delegation, batching, sponsorship, and privilege de-escalation. In terms of batching, multiple operations can be combined (ex. token approval, token spend) in an atomic transaction. Transaction sponsorship or paymaster support can also be extended to EOAs. Discrete permissioning can also be enabled with the use of sub-keys.\n\n### [EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)\n\nThis EIP introduces precompiles for performing cryptographic operations on the [BLS12-381 curve](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/) and focuses on enhancing the efficiency and security of those operations. This cryptographic primitive unlocks 120+ bits of security for operations over the pairing-friendly curves, compared to the existing BN254 precompile which only provides 80 bits of security. BLS signature verification is the primary use case for this EIP, though many other applications that rely on point additions, multiplications, and pairing operations stand to gain from this proposal; examples are zkSNARKS, cross-chain interactions, randomness beacons, and vector commitments.\n\n### [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)\n\nThis EIP proposes storing a wider window of block hashes in the storage of a dedicated system contract. Bundling historical block hashes within the state enables efficient data retrieval for applications that require extended access to historical block hashes, like stateless clients. If approved, ArbOS 40 will adapt this EIP to the L2 and store the same number of L2 block hashes that are generated in the time it takes for 8192 L1 blocks to be built - this is approximately 27 hours worth of L2 block hashes.\n\nType: Constitutional AIP\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes to upgrade Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova to ArbOS 40 “Callisto”.

We would like to propose a fix to address this so that the call returns the correct information that properly reflects the latest state of the contract’s code or code size. This change will not increment the Stylus version and so a re-activation of already-deployed Stylus contracts will not be required.\n\n## Pectra changes that are not included in the proposed ArbOS 40 Callisto Upgrade\n\nSupport and implementation for the following EIPs are not planned to be part of ArbOS 40 Callisto:\n\n* All Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) Pectra changes (EIP-6610, EIP-7002, EIP-7251, EIP-7549, EIP-7691) because Arbitrum chains do not have a beacon chain and therefore do not have a peer-to-peer layer like Ethereum does.\n* [EIP-7623: Increase calldata cost](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623): because block size variance is less of a concern on Arbitrum chains. This is because of two reasons. First, Arbitrum chains do not require nodes to send blocks over the network through its peer-to-peer layer and instead rely on the parent chain’s RPC to retrieve block data. Secondly, because Arbitrum block sizes are already limited to ~100KB and so increasing calldata cost is not expected to reduce Arbitrum block sizes.\n* [EIP-7685: General purpose execution layer requests](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7685): because Arbitrum chains do not have a beacon chain and, therefore, there is nothing to request from the EL on Arbitrum chains.\n* [EIP-7840: Add blob schedule to EL configuration files](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7840): because Arbitrum chains do not support posting blobs on the rollup (but otherwise still does support posting blobs to Ethereum L1).\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nMore detailed information about the specific implementation and versions will be provided closer to the date of the formal on-chain Tally vote. However, this proposal will roughly follow the below steps:\n\n1. An AIP outlining the proposed upgrade and specification is proposed to the ArbitrumDAO Forum for discussion (this post)\n2. A temperature check vote is held on Snapshot\n3. Engineering work to scope out and implement the relevant changes for ArbOS 40 Callisto into the Nitro node software, relevant rollup contracts, and associated upgrade actions (this work has already begun).\n4. A security audit of all ArbOS 40 relevant changes is conducted by a third-party (Trail of Bits) and the audit report is published for public consumption.\n5. A new version of Nitro and nitro-contracts is released that support ArbOS 40 Callisto.\n6. Should the Snapshot vote pass, then ArbOS 40 Callisto will be deployed to both private devnets & Arbitrum Sepolia for testing.\n7. A formal AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote.\n8. If the Tally vote passes, ArbOS 40 Callisto will be activated on Arbitrum One and on Arbitrum Nova following the required waiting periods and phases, as outlined in the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution for a Constitutional AIP](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal).\n\n### **Note on Pectra hard fork timelines:**\n\nSimilar to the [ArbOS 20 Atlas upgrade](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/arbos-releases/arbos20) and the [Ethereum Dencun hard fork](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/02/27/dencun-mainnet-announcement) in March 2024, the activation timestamp for ArbOS 40 Callisto will be targeted for roughly the same timestamp as when Ethereum Mainnet hard forks. At the time of writing and as of the latest [All Core Devs Consensus (ACDC) Call #150 held on Feb 6th, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-150-february-6-2025/22703), the timestamp of the Ethereum Mainnet fork for Pectra is targeted for April 8, 2025. The tentative dates for Ethereum Holesky and Ethereum Sepolia to upgrade to Pectra are Feb 24, 2025 and March 5, 2025, respectively. The exact slot for mainnet Ethereum is expected to be chosen on March 6, 2025.\n\nGiven that the L1 client teams are planning to release their Pectra-supported versions by Feb 13, 2025 and that the required steps for a [Constitutional AIP can take up to ~41.4 days](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal) (not including engineering and audit), there is a strong likelihood that ArbOS 40 Callisto will be activated on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova after Ethereum Mainnet upgrades to Pectra (if the ArbitrumDAO votes to adopt this proposal). We will endeavor to keep this proposal updated as timelines become more concrete.",

        "body": "# Abstract\nThe ArbitrumDAO has on-chain governance via a suite of smart contracts. It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal’s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.\n\nThis proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the **L2 Core Time Lock** contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days. Accordingly, the change only applies to constitutional proposals which require upgrades to smart contracts.\n\nThere are two benefits to increasing the delay:\n\n- **Security Council.** The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.\n- **Exit window.** Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied with how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.\n\nAdditionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice. This will help Arbitrum move one step closer towards a Stage-2 rollup.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-29 at 1.26.16 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiehq4k64tgt6r3tsvdiwojng4a2olhhcxtvpzut6pkrm3nycmb7a4)\n*Image: If this proposal passes, it would change Arbitrum ‘Exit Window’ slice from Red to Yellow, according to [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum)*\n    \nThe downside of increasing the delay is that all constitutional proposals, primarily for upgrading the smart contracts, will be delayed by 5 days. It does not impact nor add an additional delay to any spending from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury including ARB and ETH.\n\n# Time Lock Extension\n\n \n![7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de_2_1248x632.png](ipfs://bafkreidknqyjhte55xyuixzszebvlo3eejhijhebq7vsg3w5azlvspekcq)\n*Image: Overview of the Current Time Locks*\n    \n\nAll proposals voted on and passed by the ArbitrumDAO must pass through an L2 Time Lock before it can move onto the next stage.\n\nThere are currently two L2 Time Locks that are implemented via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\n\n- **L2 Treasury TimeLock.** Delays all spends from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH Treasury.\n- **L2 Core TimeLock.** Delays any actions related to on-chain upgrades.\n\nThe proposal focuses on the **Core L2 TimeLock**. It is responsible for passing messages that contain executable code and it has the authority to upgrade any smart contract in the system including on-chain governance and the bridges (holding user assets) on Arbitrum One/Nova.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the governance of smart contracts, please check out this [diagram](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/roundtrip-governance.png?raw=true) and the [docs](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md).\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal is to change the value of _minDelay from 259200 (seconds) to 691200 (seconds) in the [L2 Timelock](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract) contract.

        "body": "Category: Constitutional - Process\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n\nSection 3 of the Constitution 10 describes this council in more detail.\nInitial Setup Transparency Report 3 details the current members of the council.\nSection 4 on the Constitution outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\nExecutive summary\nThis vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\nA smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and under multiple security audits.\nThis vote is meant to temperature check with the DAO both the process that will be conducted for the elections, as well as the smart contract system that will enable them.\nA successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader Arbitrum governance architecture.\nImplementation Status\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is currently under audit and is available for full review in: GitHub - ArbitrumFoundation/governance at c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched in, the full audit report will be made available in the codebase soon. A Code4Rena audit competition has also been commissioned for the election system and can be viewed at Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production\n\nBackground\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution alongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum’s smart contract suite:\n\nConstitution of the Arbitrum DAO 2 (esp. sections 3 10 and 4) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\nDAO Governance Architecture 5 - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the reader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n\nOpen Zeppelin Governor - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\nGnosis Modules 1 - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\nHigh-level Election Overview\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to the specification laid out in the Constitution, is split into:\n\nElection stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\nUpdate stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\nElection Stages\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\nNominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\nCompliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\nMember election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\nUpdate Stages\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nSecurity Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\nL2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\nIndividual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\nSecurity Council Election Flow\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2bk2mmknletnshsvxbohkbszppbkb3wdntpnraj7x2gwgx2rgqq)\n    \nElection Stages in detail\n1. Nominee selection (7 days)\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration, candidate endorsement:\n\nElection creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\nCandidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\nEndorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\nFallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\nImplementation details\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n\nCustom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n\nA new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\nCandidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.\nDelegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n2. Compliance check by the Foundation(14 days)\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organisation being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\nImplementation details\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n\nCalling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n3. Member election (21 days)\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n\n0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n\nSplit voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\nImplementation details\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit from Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can trigger a new member election:\n\nCall the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n\nA custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\nThese additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\nThe custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\nUpdate stages in detail\n1. Security Council manager update\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n\nRemove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\nAdd a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\nAddress rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members as well as explicit approval from the member carrying out the rotation.\nImplementation details\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n2. Timelocks and withdrawal\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n\nL2 timelock (3 days),\nL2 → L1 withdrawal (~7 days),\nL1 timelock (3 days).\nYou can read more about these stages in the governance docs 1. The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\nImplementation details\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n3. Individual council updates\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis safes:\n\nArbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nArbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\nEthereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nNova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will replace them.\n\nImplementation details\nTo do this the existing Upgrade Executor contracts on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom Governance Action Contract 2 will be used to call the specific OwnerManager addOwnerWithThreshold and removeOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\nAdditional affordances\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\nThe DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favour and 5/6 of cast votes are in favour. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nConstitution Updates\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution’s text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\nUpdate timeline for the election\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n\nFrom T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nFrom T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n\nAt T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n\nNew timeline. A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\nLess than 6 eligible nominees. The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\nInstallation time. We need to remove the phrase ‘immediately join the Council’ to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user’s right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 → L1 message.\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the Constitution with the following text:\n\nNominee selection (T until T+7 days): Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n\nCompliance process (T+7 until T+21 days): All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nMember election (T+21 until T+42 days): Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n\nAt T+42 days: The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\nFinal update to the Constitution text.\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report  linked in the discussion",
