These changes are part of a broader effort to optimise the DAO’s treasury, with the goal of enhancing its performance, flexibility, and diversification.\n\nThe proposed new permissions focus on strategies involving sDAI on Gnosis Chain and new vaults to stake GNO on Stakewise V3.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nTreasury management strategies must adapt to changing market conditions and protocol updates, including migrations and the launch of new pools. Protocols and pools that were previously deemed too immature or risky for BalancerDAO may become viable as they demonstrate reliability over time. This proposal seeks to incorporate these updated strategies into the current Permissions Policy.\n\n\n# Changes to the Permissions Policy\n\nThis proposal outlines the following modifications to the permissions policy:\n\n\n\n1. sDAI on GC\n* Bridge DAI and GNO, Mainnet &lt;> GC, two ways, in Gnosis Bridge.\n* Deposit and withdraw xDAI &lt;> sDAI in Spark.\n* Swap sDAI &lt;> xDAI &lt;> USDC &lt;> USDT in Cow.\n* Swap GNO &lt;> WETH in Cow.\n2. Whitelist new vaults to stake GNO on Stakewise v3\n* [Axol](https://app.stakewise.io/vault/gnosis/0x33c346928ed9249cf1d5fc16ae32a8cffa1671ad), [Stakecat](https://app.stakewise.io/vault/gnosis/0xe0a342ed4e0f0dbe97c4810534cfcb6550ea017d), [SeedNode](https://app.stakewise.io/vault/gnosis/0x9eeb6be79899cfe45018866a2113c6b77fa96f35), [Stakesaurus](https://app.stakewise.io/vault/gnosis/0x3cb4692177525db38d983da0445d4eb25c3826de).\n\n\n# Zodiac Roles Modifier Permissions Policy\n\n\n## Permissions page\n\n[https://roles.gnosisguild.org/permissions/gno/6MHFZ0ZgjVykkwQgsdbxy0JvaZS4IWhii7UE8PLT9ME](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/permissions/gno/6MHFZ0ZgjVykkwQgsdbxy0JvaZS4IWhii7UE8PLT9ME) \n\n\n## Permissions diff page\n\n[https://roles.gnosisguild.org/gno:0x13c61a25DB73e7a94a244bD2205aDba8b4a60F4a/roles/MANAGER/diff/6MHFZ0ZgjVykkwQgsdbxy0JvaZS4IWhii7UE8PLT9ME](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/gno:0x13c61a25DB73e7a94a244bD2205aDba8b4a60F4a/roles/MANAGER/diff/6MHFZ0ZgjVykkwQgsdbxy0JvaZS4IWhii7UE8PLT9ME)",

        "body": "# PR with payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1386\n\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks approval from the BalancerDAO to allocate 250,000 USDT, currently sitting idle in the [DAO’s main multisig wallet](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f) following the termination of the Fjord fee share agreement, to the [karpatkey-managed SAFE](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x0EFcCBb9E2C09Ea29551879bd9Da32362b32fc89). These funds will be used to acquire the GYD stablecoin, issued by @FTL_labs, the creators of [Gyroscope](https://gyro.finance/). Once acquired, the GYD will be staked to convert into sGYD, unlocking yield-generating opportunities for the DAO's treasury. For more in-depth information, please refer to the original [post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-allocate-treasury-funds-of-the-balancer-dao-to-sgyd/5897/1) submitted by @FTL_Labs.\n\nBy approving this proposal, the BalancerDAO will tap into a new yield-bearing strategy for its treasury, enhancing capital efficiency and diversifying stablecoin holdings. Moreover, this move will strengthen Balancer's support for a key ecosystem partner, Gyroscope. Gyroscope pools (E-CLPs) have [demonstrated strong performance](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope), contributing 8.81% ofBalancer’s volume with only 4.54% of its total TVL.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nWhile the rationale behind this proposal is covered extensively in FTL Labs’ original [post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-allocate-treasury-funds-of-the-balancer-dao-to-sgyd/5897/1), this document covers the implementation details and requests the DAO’s approval for new permissions to be granted to the [Manager SAFE](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x60716991aCDA9E990bFB3b1224f1f0fB81538267) owned by karpatkey, allowing for the seamless integration of this new position into the managed portfolio.\n\n\n# Permissions to be added to the Manager policy\n\nOnce the 250,000 USDT is transferred to the karpatkey-managed SAFE, karpatkey will swap it for GYD on CowSwap and subsequently stake the acquired GYD on Gyroscope. Additionally, karpatkey will integrate the relevant metrics into its risk management framework to effectively monitor the position and respond swiftly to any market downturns or unforeseen events. Backup permissions for swaps on Balancer and Spark will also be added to enhance flexibility.\n\nPermissions to be added in this Proposal:\n\n1. Swap on CowSwap:\n    1. Tokens IN: DAI, GYD, sDAI, USDC, USDT, GHO\n    2. Tokens OUT: DAI, GYD, sDAI, USDC, USDT, GHO\n2. Stake/Unstake ([Deposit/Withdraw](https://app.gyro.finance/sgyd/ethereum/)) GYD on Gyroscope.\n3. Swap on Balancer:\n    3. [USDT ⇄ GYD](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0xfbfad5fa9e99081da6461f36f229b5cc88a64c6300020000000000000000062d)\n    4.

        "body": "# PR with Payload: \nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1291\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks the BalancerDAO to take the following actions:\n\n\n\n1. Have the [Balancer’s DAO main Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) claim the locked GNO in the [GNO locking contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4f8ad938eba0cd19155a835f617317a6e788c868).\n2. Bridge the GNO from mainnet to Gnosis Chain (GC) using the Gnosis Bridge.\n3. Set as destination address karpatkey’s managed Safe, whose [Gnosis Chain version](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=gno:0x0EFcCBb9E2C09Ea29551879bd9Da32362b32fc89) has just been launched.\n4. Grant permission to karpatkey to stake GNO on [Stakewise v3](https://x.com/stakewise_io/status/1816458408041574446).\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nFollowing a successful[ Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x8d4969e56fa8eb13abc7a3404b3d42fe6b4afa1c7f29111bd012314f093a2fd2) in January 2022, the BalancerDAO and the GnosisDAO conducted a token swap, resulting in 9,051 GNO being added to the DAO’s treasury. These tokens, claimed by the DAO in 2023, have been idle for a year since the locking period expired on February 15th, 2023. Now that Stakewise v3 has launched on Gnosis Chain and offers GNO staking possibilities, it’s a good opportunity to put those idle assets to work.\n\nWe propose making them available to karpatkey for yield-generating strategies, specifically staking on the [Genesis Vault](https://prerelease.stakewise.io/vault/gnosis/0x4b4406ed8659d03423490d8b62a1639206da0a7a), the [Serenita Vault](https://app.stakewise.io/vault/gnosis/0x00025c729a3364faef02c7d1f577068d87e90ba6) and the [Nedo Vault](https://app.stakewise.io/vault/gnosis/0x2cd404d9d75436e7d6ddbccc2fb9cf7c06941bf1) on Stakewise V3. At the time of this writing, these vaults offer an APR ranging between 4% and 10%.\n\n\n# Justification\n\nAs mentioned[ ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/treasury-update-unlocked-gno-allocation/4505)in [this](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/treasury-update-unlocked-gno-allocation/4505) treasury update, staking on StakeWise is the optimal choice for GNO allocation. Its non-custodial staking on Gnosis Chain offers an attractive APR without the complexities and risks of leveraged positions or providing liquidity to DEX pools.\n\nStakeWise v3 is an enhanced version of the StakeWise liquid staking protocol. The[ new version](https://stakewise.medium.com/stakewise-v3-is-coming-to-gnosis-chain-fc4a05b9b78e) features a modular architecture with an expanded node operator set, native unstaking, automatic rewards compounding. Additionally, the infrastructure upgrade for their [overcollateralized liquid staking tokens](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#overcollateralization) (os tokens) enables greater composability with other DeFi protocols and strategies. To enhance capital efficiency and sustain yield generation, a future strategy incorporating the use of osGNO could be proposed.\n\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## Deployed contracts on GC\n\nIt’s important to note that a [new Avatar Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=gno:0x0efccbb9e2c09ea29551879bd9da32362b32fc89) (also known as karpatkey’s managed treasury Safe, solely owned by the Balancer DAO) and a new [Manager Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=gno:0x60716991aCDA9E990bFB3b1224f1f0fB81538267) (owned by karpatkey to execute approved actions on behalf of the Balancer DAO) have been deployed, along with the necessary [Zodiac Roles Modifier contract](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x13c61a25DB73e7a94a244bD2205aDba8b4a60F4a) , which includes the [allowlisted permissions](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/permissions/gno/hLN8c3H4EvuSXMY9ko9Q31NQ3fwKCYBgnm2IDls7w) requested in this proposal. It is worth noting that the new Avatar and Manager Safes on Gnosis Chain have the same address as the existing ones on Mainnet.\n\nThe current setup on Gnosis Chain mirrors the [Balancer’s DAO main Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) and the existing Avatar Safe on mainnet, with the addition of one [EOA](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x7f87c1C42BeF332245F8B3cCAdD8224541CDaEcE) belonging to karpatkey, used to configure the entire setup. After the new configuration and permissions granted to karpatkey are audited, the next step will be to remove karpatkey’s EOA from the ownership structure, resulting in the same 6/11 scheme used for the other Safes mentioned.\n\nAs part of our internal due diligence and controls, we have deployed a [Test Avatar Safe](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=gno:0xC01318baB7ee1f5ba734172bF7718b5DC6Ec90E1) and thoroughly tested the staking & unstaking mechanisms of osGNO on Stakewise V3.\n\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nUpon the passing of this proposal, the following steps need to be executed.\n\nTo be executed by the new [Avatar Safe on Gnosis Chain](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=gno:0x0efccbb9e2c09ea29551879bd9da32362b32fc89):\n\n\n\n1. Remove [karpatkey’s EOA](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x7f87c1C42BeF332245F8B3cCAdD8224541CDaEcE) as an owner of the Avatar Safe in GC.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The following [payload #1](https://gist.github.com/JeronimoHoulin/a85357c8d8a115f12a70bf737543154b)</span> needs to be executed through the Avatar Safe, and this is the [Tenderly simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/100cd18f-1e90-4826-9f49-93c92e75ff2c).\n\nTo be executed by the [DAO main multisig on Mainnet](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f):\n\n1. Claim locked GNO. \n2. Bridge GNO (total balance) from Mainnet to Gnosis Chain.\n    1. Set as destination address the [new Avatar Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=gno:0x0efccbb9e2c09ea29551879bd9da32362b32fc89).\n\nThe following [payload #2](https://gist.github.com/JeronimoHoulin/fb0ac970acefcdaf69ee84451e8c7e38) needs to be executed, and this is the [Tenderly simulation](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/c04aa72e-9f22-4518-9601-7cd94dd11842). \nPR opened at: https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1291\n\nNote: you can check that the `receiver` parameter in the bridge message is set to [0x0efccbb9e2c09ea29551879bd9da32362b32fc89](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=gno:0x0efccbb9e2c09ea29551879bd9da32362b32fc89) = the Avatar Safe on GC.\n\nSubsequently, karpatkey will stake 9,051 GNO on Stakewise v3 and conduct monitoring / rebalancing / re-allocation to different vaults / exit strategies according to market conditions & liquidity.\n\n\n# Zodiac Roles Modifier Permissions Policy\n\n\n## New permissions\n\nNew permissions to be able to deposit, withdraw, mint and burn GNO on the mentioned vaults can be found in the Roles App Permissions Visualization tool.\n\n[https://roles.gnosisguild.org/permissions/gno/hLN8c3H4EvuSXMY9ko9Q31NQ3fwKCYBgnm2IDls7w](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/permissions/gno/hLN8c3H4EvuSXMY9ko9Q31NQ3fwKCYBgnm2IDls7w) \n\n\n## Update on the existing preset\n\n[https://roles.gnosisguild.org/gno:0x13c61a25DB73e7a94a244bD2205aDba8b4a60F4a/roles/MANAGER/diff/hLN8c3H4EvuSXMY9ko9Q31NQ3fwKCYBgnm2IDls7w](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/gno:0x13c61a25DB73e7a94a244bD2205aDba8b4a60F4a/roles/MANAGER/diff/hLN8c3H4EvuSXMY9ko9Q31NQ3fwKCYBgnm2IDls7w)",

Deposit USDC on Compound v3;\n2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3;\n3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3;\n4. Deposit DAI on MakerDAO’s Dai Savings Rate (DSR) module;\n5. Unstake stETH on Lido;\n6. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Rocket Pool (rETH);\n7. Swap on Cow Swap\n\n\n### Audit considerations\n\nWe propose an updated version of the [Preset permissions - Balancer Treasury](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQjkn6DAqXhdqYag0KSIfqJvdkLilOb6dM4KqaiybXc/edit) document that shows all the permissions granted to karpatkey, including the ones that are being requested now, highlighted in green.\n\nReviewing and providing feedback on the preset update [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/1f0d96856166d673551e2f316bace89d) would be a great service to the Balancer community. We welcome anyone who is willing to take the time to verify the content and encourage community members to share their feedback with us.\n\nkarpatkey's tech team is diligently working on enhancing the auditing process. Our primary goal is to provide a clearer visual representation of potential Zodiac preset modifications before implementing any proposed payload. We are committed to keeping the community informed about our progress and developments.\n\n# Proposed Actions Overview\n\n\n\n### 1. Deposit USDC on Compound v3\n\n[Compound v3](https://docs.compound.finance/) is a streamlined protocol version emphasising security, capital efficiency, and user experience. Following a [proposal](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/180) executed on September 18th, v2 is being phased out, with measures in place to transition users to v3. [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-iii-audit/) and [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/compound-iii/) have audited v3. As of the day of this writing, $319M USDC is deposited in v3, offering an APR of 4.3%, inclusive of COMP token rewards.\n\n\n\n### 2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3\n\nThis strategy aims to diversify stablecoin holdings via AAVE v3, a leading decentralised money market with a strong link to the Balancer DAO. [AAVE v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-aave-v3/6035) was officially [deployed on mainnet](https://aave.mirror.xyz/K9gQPsv-hAH-gO4oH2i0Oen8uQEHYL5q8x9xjN9XnmA) in January 2023 after being live across six networks [since March 2022](https://aave.mirror.xyz/2TnHYHQRnNhSG56Y4CcssulFArSVqrFbmAdYfU7Kxp0). This version introduces features for enhanced capital efficiency and decentralisation, coupled with new risk management tools. Comprehensive audits by firms like [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf), [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf), [Peckshield](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf), OpenZeppelin, SigmaPrime, and formal verification by [Certora](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/Certora/certora/Verification_Report.pdf). Currently, [AAVE v3](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) holds $51.6M DAI with an expected APY of 3.82%.\n\n\n\n### 3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3\n\nSame logic as above but for USDC. As of the day of this writing, the total USDC supplied on [AAVE v3](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) is $299M, and the expected APY is 2.86%.\n\n\n\n### 4. Deposit DAI on MakerDAO’s DAI Savings Rate (DSR) module\n\nMakerDAO, renowned for creating DAI, is a leading DAO in the DeFi sector. A recent [DSR rate hike](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-2-non-scope-defined-parameter-changes-may-2023/20981) in May and the [introduction of eDSR](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-enhanced-dai-savings-rate-activation-spark-protocol-debt-ceiling-increase-rwa-vault-updates-avc-member-compensation-for-q2-2023-dao-resolution-for-monetalis-clydesdale-launch-project-funding-spark-proxy-spell-execution-august-2-2023) (enhanced DSR) in August make it an attractive strategy from a risk/reward perspective. Currently, eDSR offers an APR of 5%. By diversifying the Balancer treasury’s stablecoin allocation and capitalising on the higher yield offered by one of the most battle-tested protocols, the investment approach can be optimised.\n\n\n\n### 5. Unstake stETH on Lido\n\nPost the Shapella fork in April, users can now unstake or withdraw staked ETH from the different LST providers. This action was not part of the previous preset update request to the Balancer DAO due to its timing.\n\n\n\n### 6. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Rocket Pool (rETH)\n\nTo diversify LST holdings, we suggest adding [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/) to the whitelist for ETH staking and unstaking. RocketPool ranks [third](https://dune.com/queries/2433350/3997605) in the liquid staking market, holding about 691,000 ETH, or 6% of the total market. In market share, Rocket Pool's rETH trails Lido's stETH (76%) and Coinbase's cbETH (11%). Despite slightly lower liquidity for rETH to ETH swaps on major DEXes, Balancer DAO treasury's allocated amount should face minimal slippage. For example, [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/liquidity) indicates a swap of ~5,700 rETH for ETH would have under 0.1% slippage. Currently, rETH offers an APR of 3.26%.\n\n\n\n### 7. Swap on Cow Swap\n\nThanks to the efforts of the Gnosis Builders and the karpatkey tech team, Cow Swap can now be seamlessly integrated with the Zodiac Roles Modifier. This enhancement allows for the exclusive swapping of only those tokens that are included in the whitelisted strategies.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/604\n\n# Abstract\n\nIn this revised iteration of [BIP-442](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-442-permissions-preset-update-request-2/5209/1), we've made a significant adjustment by excluding all Cow Protocol permissions from the preset. This decision arises from a recent protocol [update](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-442-permissions-preset-update-request-2/5209/5), which rendered the Zodiac Role Modifier incompatible with the Cow Protocol. To ensure the Balancer Maxis do not execute the outdated payload included in BIP-442, we preemptively halted its implementation to avoid introducing unnecessary permissions.\n\nHaving seized the opportunity to fine-tune our proposal, we've chosen to seamlessly integrate new permission requests into this framework. This approach streamlines all permissions into a unified structure, eliminating the need for another BIP in the coming weeks.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nPermissions granted to karpatkey to manage the BalancerDAO treasury are not static, and require regular updates to effectively respond to evolving market conditions and to capitalise on emerging opportunities.\n\nAs it’s customary, any changes to the preset permissions must be executed by the DAO.\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal encompasses the addition of the following permissions:\n\n\n\n1. Deposit USDC on Compound v3\n2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3\n3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3\n4. Deposit DAI on MakerDAO’s Dai Savings Rate (DSR) Module\n5. Unstake stETH on Lido\n6. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Rocket Pool (rETH)\n7. Swap various tokens on SushiSwap\n8. Swap rETH &lt;> WETH on Balancer\n9. Swap rETH &lt;> WETH on Uniswap v3\n10. Swap stETH &lt;> WETH on Curve\n11. Restake AAVE in the Safety Module\n12. Delegate AAVE/stkAAVE to karpatkey\n13. Wrap stETH\n\n\n# Audit Considerations\n\nWe propose an updated version of the [Preset permissions - Balancer Treasury](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQjkn6DAqXhdqYag0KSIfqJvdkLilOb6dM4KqaiybXc/edit?usp=sharing) document that shows all the permissions granted to karpatkey, including the ones that are being requested now, highlighted in green.\n\nReviewing and providing feedback on the preset update [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/6db0eea31d2c5dd8e08cb7735d3a68a9) would be a great service to the Balancer community. We welcome anyone who is willing to take the time to verify the content and encourage community members to share their feedback with us.",
