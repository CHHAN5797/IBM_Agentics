CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. \n\nTo enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).\n\nCurrently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. \n\nOther liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. \n\nThe liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\nIntegrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.\n\nConfidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\n [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.\n\nIntegration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.\n\n### Specification\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Audits & Relevant links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n Issuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nWhitepaper: CDCETH\nDeFillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: https://crypto.com/staking\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\n\nCommunity:\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/cryptocom\nTelegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nNews on Telegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nDiscord: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.

If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

Benefits of listing: \nslisBNB is the native yield bearing and liquid staking token for BNB, built by Lista DAO. slisBNB appreciates against BNB in line with BNB’s staking APR, allowing users have the freedom to earn additional yields on different DeFi platforms while earning staking rewards passively.\n\nslisBNB is the largest BNB LST in terms of TVL (~$225M) and holders (350,262), listing slisBNB can bring both Aave and Lista communities the opportunities to enjoy the passive yield of supplying slisBNB on Aave as well as the Lista token airdrop. \n\n2. Chain to be deployed: BNB Chain\n3. Proof of Liquidity: Lista DAO is open to provide $2500 weekly incentives, last for 8 weeks to bootstrap the liquidity of slisBNB on Aave. \n4. Useful links: https://lista.org/\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\nThis proposal is powered by core contributor of ListaDAO.\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lista DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n**Next Steps**\n1.If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2.If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3.Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-08-02\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to onboard steakLRT, Steakhouse’s restaking token built on Mellow and Symbiotic, to the Ethereum v3 Lido Instance. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe Steakhouse Resteaking Vault, steakLRT, is a wstETH-based liquid restaking token powered by Mellow and the Symbiotic restaking middleware. This is a logical extension of the work Steakhouse is doing as Lido DAO’s Finance Workstream, and is a work in progress proof of the crucial role that Lido stETH can play in helping restaking become more efficient, while preserving the decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nThe onboarding of steakLRT to the Aave v3 Lido instance aims to enhance the diversity and robustness of the Aave ecosystem by integrating a novel restaking token. \n\nsteakLRT, built on Mellow and Symbiotic, brings unique value propositions and additional yield opportunities through boosted points programs. By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance. Further, beacuse steakLRT accepts wstETH deposits, there are strategic programs that can be run to increase wstETH deposit yield through looping strategies and liquidity mining. These will continue to make the Aave v3 Lido Instance the best place to deposit wstETH as collateral. \n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMellow and Symbiotic deposits held as LRTs like steakLRT earn Symbiotic and Mellow points. \n\nMellow will do an additional boosted points program for deposits into the Aave v3 Lido instance. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: [0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nsteakLRT announcement post: https://hackmd.io/@SteakhouseFi/steakLRT\n\nsteakLRT Mellow Vault: https://app.mellow.finance/restake/ethereum-steaklrt\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Steakhouse and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nSome ACI team members are investors in Mellow.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
