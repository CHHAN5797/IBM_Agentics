        "body": "Greetings Balancer Community! Cameron from the ecosystem team at Consensys reaching out regarding a proposal for a Balancer deployment on Linea.\n\n*Please see the contact information below if you would like to reach out directly regarding this proposal.*\n\n## Intro\n\nWe recently launched the public Linea Testnet and saw overwhelmingly positive feedback from community members, users, and builders. To date, Linea has processed >11M transactions, many of which are helping us stress-test the network. In addition, the Linea team is closely aligned with developers in the ecosystem. As such, we aim to serve developers, protocols, and builders. We see Balancer as a critical piece of DeFi infrastructure to enable innovation.\n\nBalancer is more than a unique AMM; it's a versatile and adaptive protocol offering innovative features such as multi-asset pools, custom weight allocation, boosted pools, and the x-chain gauges enabled with L0. These features facilitate a wide array of DeFi strategies while providing significant advantages for growing ecosystems and the start-ups building in them.\n\nMetaMask swaps is also leveraging Balancer among the meta aggregator providers, so this deployment is key for Linea to ensure MetaMask swaps can work on Linea on mainnet from day 0 with a low switching cost.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis proposal asks the Balancer community to support deployment on the Linea testnet & Linea mainnet. Balancer's unique capabilities, paired with Linea's advanced zkEVM technology, would be a leap forward in strengthening and diversifying the DeFi ecosystem on Linea.\n\nThis proposal to deploy Balancer on Linea is about more than just bringing a protocol to Linea. It's about enabling innovation and opportunities for builders.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe have had significant interest from Linea builders, partners, and the MetaMask team to have a deployment of Balancer. These builders look forward to leveraging x-chain boosts, multiasset pools, and building protocols on top of balancer as infrastructure.\n\nMoreso, although Consensys will not always be the only support for linea development, we have a team of engineers to assist with onboarding and the innovation of new features enabled through Zks or account abstraction.\n\nWe look forward to featuring the protocol on Linea’s portal and supporting the success of the protocol on Linea.\n\n## About Linea\n\n### Linea\n\nLinea handles native EVM bytecode for proving and verification to allow the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enable developers to build on a zk-rollup while using familiar tools and infrastructure. The ConsenSys zkEVM aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence with the Ethereum VM specification specified in the yellow paper.\n\nLinea does not use transpilers or custom compilers to generate the zkProofs. Taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity significantly reduces deployment costs and surface area risk for bugs and hacks.\n\n### Other Information\n\nPlease see more details here:\n\n1. [Linea Website](http://linea.build)\n2. [Linea Block Explorer](https://explorer.goerli.linea.build/)\n3. [Linea Docs](https://docs.linea.build/)\n4. [Consensys: R&D](https://consensys.net/research-and-development/)\n\n### Timeline/Next Steps\n\nWe encourage thoughtful community discussion and will facilitate that. If this proposal passes, we will work closely with contributors on a timeline that aligns with Balancer contributors and Linea mainnet deployment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn light of this proposal, we are eager to strengthen our alliance with Balancer through this deployment. By deploying Balancer on Linea, we aim to enable a seamless user experience and growth in our communities!\n\nBuild on,\n\n## Contact Information\n\n- Email: [Governance@Consensys.net](mailto:Cameron.ODonnell@Consensys.net)\n- Forum: DAOstrat.C\n- Tg: DAOstrat\n- Calendly: [Link](https://calendly.com/daostrat/balancer-deployment-proposal-on-linea)",

        "body": "## **Summary**\n\nScroll is live on the Goerli Testnet today and is expected to launch on Mainnet in early August this year. We view Balancer’s composable liquidity products as critical building blocks of decentralized finance and we want to work with you to further expand your growth on Scroll into the future.\n\nIf approved, Balancer contributors will launch on Scroll as soon as possible after our Mainnet launch. This would add Scroll to the list of networks approved as new deployments by governance.\n\n## Background\n\n### About Scroll\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP](https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP) \nForum: [https://community.scroll.io/](https://community.scroll.io/)\n\nScroll is an L2 scaling solution that is pushing the development of an Ethereum-equivalent zkEVM. Our main priorities are to implement a bytecode-level compatible zkEVM with sound zero knowledge proofs, work on related initiatives to coordinate the development of Layer 1 and zkEVM, and reach a community standard to improve Ethereum for the end game. Security is of the highest priority for us and our current EVM implementation is well-specified and robust. Our in-house security team also operates in close conjunction with the highest-caliber auditors in the industry.\n\nScroll is built on a completely open source basis. This includes the ZK circuits, the proving system, and the verifier smart contract. Code security is also closely monitored by community developers from projects such as Zcash, 0xPARC, Privacy and Scaling Explorations, and Filecoin.\n\nToday, Scroll is currently live on the Goerli Testnet and contracts can be deployed permissionlessly by anyone anywhere. We maintain a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge that supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is more secure than classical relayer-based bridges.\n\n### **Goals**\n\nWe propose for Balancer to deploy on Scroll as early as possible (pending Scroll’s Mainnet launch). The Scroll Foundation will actively ensure that early dApp deployments to Scroll will run sustainably after launch.\n\nOn our side, there is growing interest from Lending Protocols (including Aave) and Liquid Staking Protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool for Balancer to deploy on Scroll. These protocols have shown interest in expanding their existing efforts with Balancer onto Scroll, which signals to us that the deployment of Balancer on Scroll is a high-priority task. We want to enable opportunities for Balancer to solidify a strong position in the Scroll ecosystem early on to bring value to both of our communities. \n\nCurrent areas where we see Balancer playing a key role include: \n- Supporting Liquid staking derivative projects seed liquidity for their respective assets on Scroll \n- Utilizing Cross-chain gauge boosts to leverage Aura Finance following LayerZero’s deployment on Scroll\n\nWe will also actively discover areas within our ecosystem where Balancer’s offerings will find fit, and make those connections accordingly with the DAO.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, Balancer contributors will launch on Scroll as soon as possible after our Mainnet launch. This would add Scroll to the list of networks approved as new deployments by governance.",
