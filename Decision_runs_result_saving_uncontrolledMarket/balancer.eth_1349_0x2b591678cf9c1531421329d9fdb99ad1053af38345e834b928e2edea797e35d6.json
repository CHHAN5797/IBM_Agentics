E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception**. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n> * T**he pool has already been launched [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf01b0684C98CD7aDA480BFDF6e43876422fa1Fc1#code).**\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * Lido's wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * WETH is a wrapper-token and an ERC-20 token representing ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> * We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency compared to the largest, existing [StableSwap pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x32296969ef14eb0c6d29669c550d4a0449130230000200000000000000000080). The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n> * *The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the recently deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP. The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilisation. The stacked area chart shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon soon after inception, with only a fraction of total TVL.*\n> \n>  ![gyro1.png](ipfs://bafkreifpe3brj7btgkabof7if2zrm2huyd62xjky223schjnnkzo5d6fia)\n> \n>  ![gyro2.png](ipfs://bafybeifiprubxky4vdikxilkbt5joms4aaihk2b2r25jruimh6jb6xf6bu)\n> \n> * E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).\n\n> ## Specifications\n> \n> > * **Governance**\n> > \n> >   The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon.
