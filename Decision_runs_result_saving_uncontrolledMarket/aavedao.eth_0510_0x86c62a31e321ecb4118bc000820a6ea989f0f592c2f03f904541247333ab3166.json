The authors propose a process by which interested parties publish an application to the Aave Forum (governance.aave.com 1), after a period of discussion and comment, an offchain vote is taken using Snapshot. Should that temperature check vote be successful, an on-chain vote targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor will formally add the address and its initial cap to the GHO system as a facilitator. This post outlines the process in detail, an addition includes 2 sample applications for each of the facilitators Aave Companies has released publicly, Aave V3 & Flash Minter.\n\n# Motivation\nThe GHO Stablecoin Protocol will be governed by the Aave DAO, specifically the Aave DAO Short Executor. There are 3 new processes that the Aave DAO will need to implement:\n- a process for facilitator onboarding\n- a process for adjustment of a facilitator limit\n- a process for facilitator offboarding.\n\nThis document only intends to address the first of these processes.\n\n# Implementation\nThe Facilitator onboarding process will begin with a post on the Aave Governance Forum (governance.aave.com 1) conforming to the template below. Next, a 7 day discussion period will commence for the community to ask questions. After the discussion period a snapshot temperature check can be posted on Snapshot. The standard snapshot process with an informal quorum of 320,000 votes is suggested to ensure sufficient community input is received and to keep consistency with existing governance processes. Should the temperature check be successful, another discussion period of 7 days will commence for the community to further refine the proposal. The authors hope that during this second period technical and risk contributors especially provide feedback on the proposed facilitator design, terms of the credit line and the initial GHO limit being requested. Following this second discussion period, an on-chain proposal targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor can then be posted via the Aave DAO Governance contracts to formally on-board the facilitator with its initial GHO limit.\n\n# Specification\nFOR - Adopt this process for onboarding GHO Facilitators\n\nNAE - Do not adopt this process for onboarding GHO Facilitators\n\nABSTAIN - Abstain\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n# Facilitator Application Template\n## Background\n- Title of Facilitator\n- High Level Description of Mechanism / Request\n- Author / Link to License\n- Link to whitepaper (if applicable)\n- How Facilitator Furthers GHO\n- Organization / DAO responsible for operation of the Facilitator (if applicable)\n- History, Details, Background of the operator of the Facilitator (if applicable)\n## Credit Line Details\n- Requested Facilitator Cap\n- Cap Increase Roadmap (if applicable)\n- Use of Funds\n- Revenue Streams\n- Revenue Split / Interest Terms\n- Collateral Posted\n- Other Commercial Details/Considerations\n## Mechanism & Risk Details\n- Detailed Description of the Facilitator\n- How Facilitator is backing GHO\n- If RWA - description of legal structure etc\n- Detail any / all risks (Oracle risk, Third-party Dependencies, Contract risk, Cross-chain, Bridging, Regulatory, etc) as well as any prevention/mitigation methods\n## Governance Controls\n- List of controls given to Aave DAO\n- Controls given not to Aave DAO\n- Alternative controls / roles that may be present but not set (optimistic governance?

By matching the Aave V2 parameters, we aim to encourage migration and ensure a smoother transition for users. This proposal does not suggest any changes to Aave V3 caps or interest rate strategies.\n\n### **Proposed Aave V3 Parameter Changes**\nTo make Aave V3 more attractive for migration and to match Aave V2 parameters, we propose the following changes:\n\n1. Loan-to-Value (LTV): Increase the LTV from 60% to 66%.\n2. Liquidation Threshold (LT): Increase the LT from 70% to 73%.\n3. Liquidation Penalty (LP): Maintain the current LP of 7.5%, as it is already in alignment with Aave V2.\n\nNo changes to Aave V3 caps or interest rate strategies are proposed in this ARFC.\n\n### **Recap Table**\n| Parameter                | Current Aave V3 | Current Aave V2 | Proposed Aave V3 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)      | 60%             | 66%             | 66%              |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT)| 70%             | 73%             | 73%              |\n| Liquidation Penalty (LP)  | 7.5%            | 7.5%            | 7.5%             |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal.\nThis ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~26k AAVE or related assets for a value of approx $2M.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Gather feedback and input from the Aave community and risk service providers on the proposed risk parameters and deployment details.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to update the risk parameters on the Aave V3 Ethereum market.\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This would be achieved by integrating sDAI, an ERC-4626 Vault token that includes the DSR yield, into the Aave protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DSR is a variable rate set by MakerDAO governance that allows DAI holders to earn savings by locking their DAI into the DSR contract. Recently, MakerDAO governance plans to increase the DSR rate to 3.49%. By integrating the DSR into Aave via sDAI, we can allow Aave liquidity providers to benefit from the DSR rate without additional cost to the Aave DAI borrowers.\n\n## Specification\n\nAt the protocol level, when a user deposits DAI, the protocol will wrap their DAI in the form of sDAI and deliver aDAI to the user. When a user borrows DAI, the protocol will unwrap the stored sDAI, deliver DAI, and accrue the debt amount in DAI.\n\n![image|1920x1563, 40%](upload://fQNJl46MrGPtwEuH6Trg6zzyqNP.jpeg)\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis integration will have the consequence of increasing the gas cost of using DAI in Aave for every user. The exact impact of these gas cost increases should be reviewed and considered by the community during the ARFC stage of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK receives positive feedback and a Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, the next step would be to draft an ARFC\ndetailing the technical implementation of this integration.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not paid by makerDAO or any third party to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

There are ARCs, ARFCs and AIPs that govern all aspects of the Aave Protocol.\n\nThis proposal aims to streamline the Aave Governance Process by renaming ARCs to become known as TEMP CHECKs and clearly defining the specific kinds of proposals that are TEMP CHECKs and which kinds of proposals will be regarded as ARFCs.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDue to the lack of a clear distinction between the proposals in Aave Governance, the Aave Governance Process is overwhelmed by proposals which could have shorter proposal timelines because they have been previously discussed and form part of the day-to-day operations of the Aave DAO.\n\nThis proposal is intended to shorten the lifecycle for mature proposals involving Risk Service Providers’ direct involvement while clearly distinguishing which proposals have to pass through the entire Aave Governance Process to enable ample community feedback and participation.\n\n## Specification\n\n\n\nTEMP CHECKs shall become the first step in the Aave Governance Process; if a proposal falls into the scope of a TEMP CHECK as defined below, then the proposal shall start as a TEMP CHECK, and after the TEMP CHECK phase, the proposal shall be submitted as an ARFC before becoming an AIP.\n\nHowever, where a proposal does not fall under the TEMP CHECK scope, the proposal will be regarded as an ARFC and subsequently become an AIP.\n\n## Amendments\n\nWe recommend the renaming of ARCs to become known as TEMP CHECKs.\n\n## Proposal Distinctions\n\nTEMP CHECKS\n\nAny proposal which falls under the scope outlined below will be known as a TEMP CHECK, and the title of the proposal must contain “TEMP CHECK”. TEMP CHECKs are proposal conversation starters which do not require input from Aave DAO Service Providers.\n\nAny discussion which requires general community feedback.\nDiscussing listing of Assets not previously listed in any Aave Market.\nAny proposal which involves deploying Aave on a new network.\nAny discussion or proposal which involves the assessment of GHO Facilitator candidates.\nAny discussion or proposal which involves the assessment of Portals Operator candidates.\nAny discussion or proposal which involves the assessment of New Service Provider Candidates.\nARFCs\n\nThese refer to mature and significant technical proposals which require the input of Aave DAO Risk Service Providers. The format of an ARFC must align with the format of an AIP, which will be escalated to Snapshot and subsequently On-Chain Aave Governance.\n\nThe following proposals fall within the scope of an ARFC:\n\nRisk Parameter Changes of currently onboarded assets.\nA proposal involving the onboarding of an asset which is already onboarded on an Aave Market.\nAny proposal involving the renewal of a previously engaged Aave Service Provider.\n\nNB: It is important to note that the Fast Track 2 & Direct to AIP shortcuts, such as the Caps Update Framework 1, are still valid under this amendment; these shortcuts are designed to enable quick mechanical improvements of the Aave Protocol.",

By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value (USDT) | Proposed Value (USDT) | Current Value (USDC) |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| LTV       | 0%                   | 74%                  | 74%                  |\n| LT        | 0%                   | 76%                  | 76%                  |\n| LB        | 0%                   | 4.5%                 | 4.5%                 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the ARFC Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
