To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by **a series of incremental decreases**, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.\n\nIn the graph below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. For the proposed, 3% LT decrease, the impact on users at the time of this post is negligible (2 accounts liquidated, ~3$ liquidated).\n\n![CRV (1)|600x371](upload://tHX5xvHscvxnCa5Bb5KfLENt1HG.png)\n\n\n|Liquidation Treshold| Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|55| 2 | ~$3 |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation |Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |\n| CRV | LT | 58 | 55 |-3% |\n| CRV | LTV | 52 | 49 |-3% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n2.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the **frozen** V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. \n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. \n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n- “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |\n| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |\n| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |\n| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |\n- “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |\n| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |\n| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for CRV on Aave V3 Polygon.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the market liquidity of CRV has seen a substantial decline following the initial Polygon V3 listing, this proposal seeks to address this by decreasing the liquidation threshold (LT) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market climate. \n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. We suggest reaching the desired settings with a series of incremental decreases to minimize this impact. This proposal recommends a slightly more aggressive reduction than the one discussed in the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, reducing the LT by 5%.\n\nChaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.\n\nAt the time of writing this post, zero (0) accounts will be affected by the proposed decrease.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 80 | 75 |\n| CRV | LTV | 75 | 70 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to V3, where users can enjoy the benefits of enhanced risk mitigation mechanisms.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by **a series of incremental decreases**, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nTo avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, [Nansen Connect](https://connect.nansen.ai/), and [Blockscan Chat](https://chat.blockscan.com/)).\n\nBelow, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users.\n\nAt the time of this proposal, none of the current positions will be eligible for liquidation due to the proposed change.\n\n**$MKR**\n- Zero (0) accounts are eligible for liquidation.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n|Asset|Parameter|Current| Rec.|Change|\n|---| --- | ---| --- | ---  |\n| MKR | Liquidation Threshold |67%| 64%| -3% |\n| MKR | Loan-to-Value | 62%| 59%| -3%|",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\nA proposal to adjust eight ( 8) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for four (4) assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Abstract\nFollowing recent market events, the AAVE community has decided to reduce the risk profile across many higher volatile assets by disabling borrow or freezing across v2 markets ([AIP-121](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/121/), [AIP-124](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/124/), and [AIP-125](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/125/))\n\nAfter mitigating the immediate risk to the protocol with the above AIPs, Chaos Labs is exploring the impact and trade-offs of decreasing the Liquidation Thresholds and LTVs of long-tail assets on Ethereum v2 (ENS, MKR, SNX, and CRV).\n\nThis proposal is the second in a [series of proposals](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897) intended to reduce the viability of different attack vectors on v2 assets.\n\n## Motivation\nCapital efficiency reductions on v2 assets will further mitigate attack vectors, in part by increasing the capital required to wage a price manipulation attack on Aave. In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to v3, where users can enjoy the benefits of E-mode with enhanced risk techniques and mitigation methodologies.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments 7 days before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, Nansen Connect, and Blockscan Chat).\n\nIn the graphs below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users for community discussion.\n\nMainnet snapshot captured on December 4th, 2022, 16:30 GMT\n## CRV\n \n![Untitled (4) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiftomsg4ucgq7agu6zjw7pfwwhg2u5nmeey2vwtste3qa4y376wkm)\n    \n## MKR\n \n![Untitled (5) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreietyanzm7dze2asldgw7w52cqjjkdstwwtuyv426ffuyr6wucxkti)\n    \n## SNX\n \n![Untitled (6) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreie55jwuybptqvjghrxctp6bymjl4oavkfvtkdsy42ah4iypdnpg6q)\n    \n## ENS\n- Zero (0) liquidations for up to an 8% reduction.\n## Joint Reduction of $MKR, $CRV, $SNX and $ENS\n- Reducing LTs jointly for the above long tail assets by 3% results in less than 6K USD worth of liquidations\n \n![Untitled (7) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiczlhq32rrj7fjbs66gv4v52twb7ghezkp4em6pg5k5oy6ge3fl54)\n## Joint Reductions with $USDC and $DAI\n- The assets can also be reduced jointly with the suggested [USDC, DAI change](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897) without causing additional liquidations.\n\n## Recommendation\n \n![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 2.13.57 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreif72fcajvopiooewsizhljqusudsa7rzu6tdxq6oryef6tjeezloq)",
