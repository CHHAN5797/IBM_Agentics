        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2032\n\n## Summary\n\nThis publication proposed enabling new **rETH/aWETH** gauges for Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Arbitrum, Base and Optimism.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [Rocket Pool Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool GitHub](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool)\n- [Rocket Pool Twitter](https://twitter.com/rocket_pool)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol that allows users to stake ETH and receive rETH, a liquid staking token representing their staked ETH plus accrued rewards. The protocol is designed to be community-owned, decentralized, and trustless, aligning with Ethereum's core principles.\n\nrETH accrues staking rewards over time, reflecting the performance of the underlying validators operated by a decentralized network of node operators. Users can stake as little as 0.01 ETH, making staking accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), which oversees protocol parameters and upgrades, ensuring that the protocol remains community-driven and secure.\n\nFor more details, see the [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3 with an Aave Boosted pool will enhance the capital efficiency of the rETH liquidity pools. The integration of aWETH (aArbWETH; aBasWETH, aOptWETH), which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and provides liquidity providers with additional yield opportunities.\n\nThe new **rETH/aWETH** pools will serve as the primary liquidity venue for rETH on L2s, replacing the existing v2 pool. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users interacting with Aave-based strategies.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for rETH.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), comprising RPL token holders who vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes. This decentralized governance model ensures that the protocol remains aligned with the interests of its community.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nRocket Pool utilizes a decentralized oracle network operated by the Oracle DAO (oDAO), which consists of independent node operators. These oracles are responsible for reporting validator balances and other critical data to the protocol's smart contracts, ensuring accurate and reliable operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nRocket Pool's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [Rocket Pool GitHub repository](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nRocket Pool is designed to minimize centralization risks. Governance decisions are executed by the pDAO, and the oracle network is decentralized across multiple independent operators, ensuring robust security and trustlessness throughout the protocol.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nThe existing Balancer v2 rETH/WETH pools have demonstrated strong performance, serving as a significant liquidity venue for rETH. Transitioning to a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool is expected to further enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Base](https://balancer.fi/pools/base/v2/0xc771c1a5905420daec317b154eb13e4198ba97d0000000000000000000000023)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Arbitrum](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Optimism](https://balancer.fi/pools/optimism/v2/0x4fd63966879300cafafbb35d157dc5229278ed2300020000000000000000002b)\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **rETH/aWETH** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for rETH on L2s, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aWETH. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and the ease of leveraging or unwinding on lending protocols.\n\n## Specification\n\nFollowing root gauges need to be added to the gauge controller\n\n|Chain|Pool|Pool Address|Root Gauge|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Arbitrum|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x5418a64e0cdb20548ACB394f5D00a089BAf02161|0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb|\n|Base|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0xB7B8B3AfC010169779C5C2385ec0eB0477FE3347|0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6|\n|Optimism|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x870c0Af8A1af0B58b4b0bD31CE4fe72864ae45BE|0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8|\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n\ngauge(address):`0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb` \ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum` \n\ngauge(address):`0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6` \ngaugeType(string): `Base` \n\ngauge(address):`0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8` \ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload \nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1975\n\n[BIP-819] Enable Aave Boosted osETH/aWETH Gauge on Balancer v3 Arbitrum\n\n# Summary\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the new **osETH/aWETH** Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Arbitrum. \n\n# References/Useful Links\n\n- [StakeWise Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n- [StakeWise Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n- [StakeWise Github](https://github.com/stakewise)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) \n\n# Protocol Description\n\nStakeWise is a DeFi protocol that provides a simple, non-custodial, and secure way to stake ETH and GNO, while preserving access to DeFi through liquid staking tokens such as osETH and osGNO. It enables users to not only stake but also farm, restake, and borrow against their staked assets.\n\nStakeWise V3 introduces a permissionless staking marketplace that allows users to choose their own node operators, optimize staking profits, minimize slashing risk, and even operate their own Vaults. Vaults are isolated, trustless staking pools that offer fully customizable staking terms, ensuring a tailored and secure staking experience for individuals, DAOs, and institutions alike.\n\nAt the core of StakeWise V3 is osETH — a liquid staking token that offers in-built slashing protection and accrues rewards from a highly diversified network of validators. osETH minting is dependent on the Vault’s LTV ratio, with standard Vaults allowing minting up to 90% of the staked ETH value, and DAO-approved Vaults offering up to 99.99% LTV, backed by stringent requirements and a 5M SWISE bond for enhanced security.\n\nStakeWise DAO, governed by SWISE token holders, oversees protocol parameters, operator standards, and Treasury management, ensuring that the protocol remains community-driven and secure.\n\nFor more details, see the [StakeWise Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/).\n\n# Motivation\n\nTokenLogic has been working with StakeWise to adopt an Aave Boosted pool upong migration liquidity from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3. The new Aave Boosted Pool will significantly enhance the capital efficiency of the osETH liquidity pool and provide liquidity providers access to yield from Aave. \n\nThe new **osETH/aWETH** pool will replace the existing v2 pool as the primary liquidity venue for osETH. The new Aave Boosted pools will offer superior capital efficiency with WETH deposits earning yield from Aave and greater liquidity concentration, from a higher Amplification factor, is expected to enhance liquidity depth, thereby providing a better user experience whilst also generating a cost savigns for StakeWise. \n\nA gauge is critical to bootstrap TVL, strengthen liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for osETH, helping it become a core building block for staking-related strategies across the ecosystem.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## 1. Governance\n\nThe StakeWise protocol is governed by the StakeWise DAO, with all decision-making power vested in SWISE token holders. Protocol upgrades that involve upgradable contracts must undergo a community vote, followed by multisig approval, ensuring a transparent and decentralized governance process. Core infrastructure components, such as the osETH token contracts, are immutable, providing additional security and resilience to the protocol.\n\n## 2. Oracles\n\nStakeWise leverages a decentralized and independent oracle network consisting of 11 established staking service providers. These operators are bound by service-level agreements (SLAs) and are responsible for accurately and reliably reporting validator balances to the protocol’s smart contracts, ensuring transparency and operational integrity. [More information here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oracles).\n\n## 3. Audits\n\nStakeWise V3 has been audited by **Halborn**, **Sigma Prime** and Consensys. All the audits can be found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits).\n\n## 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nStakeWise is designed to minimize centralization risks. Governance decisions are executed fully on-chain by SWISE token holders, while the oracle network is decentralized across multiple independent and reputable staking operators, ensuring robust security and trustlessness at every layer of the protocol.\n\n## 5. Market History\n\nThis is a new Balancer v3 pool specifically created to provide osETH liquidity paired with aWETH (Aave-wrapped WETH). The V2 pool has been doing great for the past two years and has grown to be one of the biggest Balancer pool by TVL.\ncf: [Balancer V2 Pool, Eth](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635)\n\n## 6. Value\n\nThe **osETH/aWETH** pool will serve as the primary liquidity hub for osETH, enabling seamless integrations with major DeFi protocols that use aWETH as a base asset. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical to facilitating efficient swaps and expanding osETH’s utility.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Enable Gauges\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig '0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860' will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at '0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd' and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: 0x1a36195044abbad8807ceea78ec645c0c5d09593\n- Gauge(address): 0x0fc6169f74b1d0bbe7a269c1ee8d92edb58b1ade\n- GaugeType(string): Arbitrum\n\nMaxi Edits:\n\n* added pool address\n* added gauge address\n* add payload",

Governance**\n\n   * There is no governance for now.\n   * For USDN, some contracts are renounced.\n   * The remaining contracts are managed by a 3/5 multisig controlled internally by the team\n\n**2. Audits**\n\n   * [Paladin Blockchain Security](https://smardex.io/audits/paladin.pdf)\n   * [Trails of Bits](https://smardex.io/audits/trail-of-bits.pdf)\n   * [Hacken Proof](https://hackenproof.com/companies/smardex) and [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/smardex/information/) for bug bounties, up to $5,500,000\n\n**3. Centralization Vectors**\n\n   * There is no governance; the team manages all operations. Some contracts are renounced, while others are controlled by a 3/5 multisig\n\n**4. Market History**\n\n   * SDEX launched March 18, 2023, and can be traded on various DEX (Smardex, Uniswap, Raydium) and CEX (Gate, Bitget, MECX).\n\n**5. Value**\n\n   * Offering greater liquidity for the SDEX token\n   * SDEX vote incentives (aka ‘bribes’) for veBAL holders\n\n## Specification\n\n**Enable Gauges:**\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig 0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdder contract to activate:\n\n* Pool Address: 0xe2332649955c7c98389480ab46dd4cb6755ac703\n* Rate Provider: 0xf4b5d1c22f35a460b91edd7f33cefe619e2faaf4\n* tokenized vault: 0x0fe906e030a44ef24ca8c7dc7b7c53a6c4f00ce9\n* Gauge Type: Ethereum\n* Gauge Address: [0x4eB7C7fD67B9b2C24d9fF1601ccDa5A01bD40c7f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4eB7C7fD67B9b2C24d9fF1601ccDa5A01bD40c7f)",

It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs\n\nKelp has more than 260,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 40,000 users across multiple L2s. All of this is within 4 months of launch\n\nBy providing liquidity for the restaked positions, wrsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nKelp is seeking to establish the [rsETH/ETH on Arbitrum] and on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of rsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon\n2. **Oracles:** Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.\n3. **Audits:** Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena.\n4. Sigma Prime Report: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/SigmaPrime.pdf\n5. Code4rena: [Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-11-kelp)\n6. MixBytes: [KELPDAO LRT-ETH SECURITY AUDIT REPORT](https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/mixbytes.pdf)\n7. **Centralization vectors:** Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\nKelp's goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.\n\n- . **Market History:** Kelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 260k ETH and >40,000 holders of rsETH across mainnet and L2s.\n\n\n\nArbitrum pool: [Balancer](TO BE ADDED)\nRate provider: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3222d3de5a9a3ab884751828903044cc4adc627e#code\n\n- . **Value:** This will be the first wrsETH balancer pool on Arbitrum and is aimed at providing primary liquidity for wrsETH on ARB.\n\n**Technical Specifications:**\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x061130d4715FCD4828BfCAf6B1a9B93DF5e6e4c9`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
