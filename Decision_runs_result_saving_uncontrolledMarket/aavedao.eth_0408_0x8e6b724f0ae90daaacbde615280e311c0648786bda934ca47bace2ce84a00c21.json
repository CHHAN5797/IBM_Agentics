This contract was created by @efecarranza during their tenure at [Llama](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-aave-swapper-and-strategic-asset-manager-contracts/14522/3).\n\nTo ensure the Aave DAO's financial stability and the ability to transfer assets across different networks through the shortExecutor, it is crucial to establish equivalent contracts for other networks. One such scenario involves moving USDC from Avalanche to Ethereum, effectively extending the DAO's stable coin runway.\n\nThis publication recommends the development of the following tooling contracts:\n\n1) Avalanche to Ethereum\n2) Optimism to Ethereum\n3) Arbitrum to Ethereum\n\nUpon the creation of these contracts, they will become public goods within the Aave ecosystem. This means that anyone will have the capability to draft a payload for transferring the DAO's funds between various networks with minimal effort.\n\nOnce the Avalanche to Ethereum bridge contract is completed, TokenLogic intends to propose a fund migration to the Ethereum Treasury to support the ongoing financial stability of the DAO.\n\n# Specification\n\nTokenLogic is to create the following contracts:\n\n1) Avalanche Bridge to Ethereum\n2) Arbitrum Bridge to Ethereum\n3) Optimism Bridge to Ethereum\n4) Transfer Funds Avalanche to Ethereum\n\n@BGDLabs is to review and approve these contracts.\n\n# Funding\n\nTo facilitate the development and implementation of the previously mentioned contracts, this publication seeks the following funding:\n\n**Funding Amount:** $12,430.00, to be paid in GHO.\n**Delivery Schedule:** The estimated timeframe for completion is approximately 5 weeks, which includes the review by @BGDLabs (an estimated 2 weeks).\n\nThe deliverables will undergo approval by @bgdlabs to ensure their completeness. The Avalanche bridge contract will play a pivotal role in moving funds from Avalanche to Ethereum, thereby providing support for the DAO's financial stability.\n\nThe transfer of funds as per the approved amount will occur upon the successful delivery of the contracts. The Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:\n\n1) YAE\n2) NAE\n3) ABSTAIN\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.\n\nThe DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - vlAURA\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza\ncreated: 2023-11-03\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes locking the AURA holding in vlAURA via the Strategic Asset Manager and delegating managing the position to the GHO Liquidity Committee.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave DAO holds a substantial amount of AURA, and the GHO Liquidity Committee (GLC) is actively executing this [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061) by swapping 400,000 USDC worth of AURA on the market.\n\nThe next step in implementing the strategy is for the DAO to lock the AURA holdings. This publication proposes sending the AURA to the [Strategic Asset Manager](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#code) (SAM) contract. From here, the full amount of AURA should be locked using [Function 9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#writeProxyContract) for vlAURA. The voting rights are to be delegated to the [GLC](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60) using [Function 5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#writeProxyContract).\n\nThe Guardian role on the SAM contract is already configured to the GLC SAFE address. This can be verified using the Read as Proxy [Function 10](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#readProxyContract). The Aave v3 Protocol [shortExecutor](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEE56e2B3D491590B5b31738cC34d5232F378a8D5#internaltx) is set up as the Owner of the SAM contract, as seen via [Function 12](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6235d8071dbee0a20e7d6ebb214f65d913c7ac1b#readProxyContract). This means the DAO's on-chain governance process can interact with the SAM and, more importantly, retrieve the DAO's funds if anything were to happen to the GLC.\n\nOnly the Owner can transfer funds from the SAM, meaning the Guardian (multisig) cannot transfer funds, and the funds can only be transferred to the Treasury, which is [hardcoded](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/208/files#diff-5ee0295025c5828238f7b67392b7e4868cfa5d3e4c11fcb5170cf1abddaa74d7R39) into the contract. This means the auraBAL yield ([2.38%](https://app.aura.finance/#/1/lock)) from vlAURA must be transferred to the Treasury before being transferred to another address where it can be managed.\n\nThe one missing piece of functionality in the SAM is the ability to sell the vlAURA voting rights by participating in [Quests](https://quest.paladin.vote/#/bal) on Paladin. This functionality will only take a few days to create before being sent to @bgdlabs for review as part of the normal payload review process.\n\nWith the AURA locked in the SAM contract, the GLC is then responsible for managing the DAO's holdings in the best interest of the DAO/GHO. This entails voting on Aura Finance gauges, governance votes in Aave DAO's best interest, and selling vlAURA votes via Paladin when it makes sense to do so.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below details the key steps to be implemented:\n\n* Strategic Assets Manager upgraded to support selling vlAURA voting rights on Paladin\n* AURA is transferred to the Strategic Assets Manager contract\n* AURA is locked for vlAURA\n* Voting rights of vlAURA are to be delegated to the GLC\n* GLC is to manage the vlAURA holding\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2) In 5 days scalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage.\n3) If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Swap Upgrade\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza \ncreated: 2023-11-02\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThs publication proposes that the Aave DAO engages TokenLogic to upgrade the Aave Swap Contract to include Limit Orders and TWAP swap functionality.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe intial iteration of the Aave Swap contract includes the functionality to swap one asset for another within a pre-defined variance relative to Chainlink Oracle(s). ie: Chainlink Oracle +/- 50bps slippage including gas cost. \n\nIn recent proposals, the DAO has committed to using the Cowswap TWAP functionality to acquire AURA. This highlights a functionality gap on the Aave Swap contract. This publication proposes upgrading the swap contract to include TWAP functionality. The TWAP feature is to use the new Composable COW (Composable Conditional Orders). An example is shown below:\n\nAlice wants to sell 12,000,000 DAI for at least 7500 WETH. She wants to do this using a TWAP, executing a part each day over a period of 30 days.\n\n`sellToken` = DAI\n`buytoken` = WETH\n`receiver` = address(0)\n`partSellAmount` = 12000000 / 30 = 400000 DAI\n`minPartLimit` = 7500 / 30 = 250 WETH\n`t0` = Nominated start time (unix epoch seconds)\n`n` = 30 (number of parts)\n`t` = 86400 (duration of each part, in seconds)\n`span` = 0 (duration of span, in seconds, or 0 for entire interval)\n\nIf Alice also wanted to restrict the duration in which each part traded in each day, she may set span to a non-zero duration. For example, if Alice wanted to execute the TWAP, each day for 30 days, however only wanted to trade for the first 12 hours of each day, she would set span to 43200 (ie. 60 * 60 * 12). Using span allows for use cases such as weekend or week-day only trading.\n\nWhilst integration the TWAP functionality, this publication proposes adding Limit Order functionality. The lift to do so is minimal and it offers additional functionality. Limit Orders enable the DAO to swap one asset for a minimum amount of the received asset. ie: Swap 1 ETH for a minimum 1700 USDC. \n\nTo support the developers using the Aave Swap contract, this publication proposes creating a command-line interface (CLI) using Tenderly to verify if the swaps can be executed at prevailing market conditions. This tool serves the dual purpose of ascertaining the feasibility of a swap and help the developer to determine the appropriate slippage percentage to use.\n\nSlippage in the context of COW Swap does not mean that it will be that number, COW Swap matches orders on a best case basis and the actual cost of the full transaction could be lower. The slippage mentioned here is a worst case scenario that takes into account both the counter-party's price as well as gas costs. Slippage as commonly known could be 0.1% and 0.9% could be gas costs depending on the network utilization at the time of the swap, assuming a 1% slippage. Even allowing for 1% slippage, once executed, the total gas costs + real slippage might end up only being 0.5%.\n\n# Specification\n\n## TWAP Orders\n\nUsing Composable Cow upgrade the Aave Swap contract to perform TWAP swaps.\n\nThe details on Composable Cow can be found [here](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow).\n\nThis upgrade involves adding a Payload template and tests cases.\n\n## Limit Orders\n\nUsing the new price checker introduced by Milkman, upgrade the Aave Swap contract to perform limit order swap. \n\nThis upgrade involves adding a Payload template and tests cases.\n\n## Tenderly\n\nCreate a CLI tool that uses Tenderly to proactively verify the feasibility of proposed swaps.\n\nThis tool offers an approximate assessment of whether a trade with the specified parameters is attainable. It will return `true` for a swap that is likely to succeed and `false` if not likely to succeed. If not likely, then the user can check with a bigger slippage tolerance.\n\nCould also extend it to suggest a slippage given the size of the order and market conditions. \n\nWe want to again reiterate that because of the nature of DAO governance, once the payload is executed, conditions might have changed so we always recommend extending a bit the MAX allowed slippage to account for this.\n\n# Funding\n\nTo facilitate the development, this publication seeks the following funding:\n\n**Funding Amount:** $12,672.00 USD, to be paid in GHO.\n**Delivery Schedule:** 5 weeks, which includes an estimated 2wk review period.\n\nAs part of our normal process, we intend to submit our work to @bgdlabs for review. We do this to ensure our work is of the highest quality.\n\nThe transfer of funds will occur with an AIP submission upon successfully completing the scope. \n\nThe Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:\n\n1) YAE\n2) NAE\n3) ABSTAIN\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.\n3) Upon delivering the scope, TokenLogic will submit a AIP to create an allowance or transfer for equivalent 12,672.00 USD settled in GHO.\n\nThe DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Introducing StrategicAssetManager \nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon & Fermin\ncreated: 2023-07-05\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThe `StrategicAssetManager` is a dedicated contract for managing Aave DAO's strategic assets. At launch the `StrategicAssetManager` will manage the DAO's veBAL holding.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave DAO is soon to attain a veBAL holding. To maximise the upside for holding the strategic asset, the DAO needs a practical means of managing the asset.\n\nThe veBAL holding needs to be continually relocked to optimise goverance and rewards. Gauge votes are weekly and would require numerous AIPs to manage the veBAL effectively. Aave DAO also has an opportunity to participate in Balancer's governance on Snapshot votes via delegating governance rights.\n\nThe StrategicAssetManage will also hold the sdCRV position if approved by AIP. Yield generated from each strategic holding can be claimed, swapped and redeposited to compound into each strategy over time. The swaps have MEV protection and can be customised to have defined maximum amount of price impact.\n\nGiven the sheer volume and frequency of transactions to be performed, there exists a desire to minimum AIP votes. The StrategicAssetManager contains the ability for the `ShortExecutor` to assign an `AssetManager`. This role can be likened to a Treasury Committee (as suggested Part 4 of SM upgrade publications) and provides the DAO optionality to introduce a committee separte from this proposal once adequate guidelines are in place. \n\nThe contract contains an allow list which implements tight restrictions around which contracts the `AssetManager` role can interact with. Further definition relating to what the `AssetManager` can do will be defined in the [ARFC] publication.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the StrategicAssetManager:\n\n* Deposit/withdraw voteEscrow contract \n* Lock/relock B-80BAL-WETH\n* Participate in gauge votes\n* Delegate governance voting rights\n* Allocate boost\n* Update boost\n* Delegate boost\n* Allow boost on Warden \n* List boost on Warden (if the  DAO votes for it)\n* Claim protocol fees & other rewards \n* Transfer assets (ie: collector contracts)\n* Ability to lock other strategic assets\n* Receive assets from the collector\n* Receive assets from the Economic Reserve\n\nThe contract is upgradeable and controlled by Aave's [`Short Executor`](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide#the-short-executor-is-used-for-non-governance-related-proposals-such-as-asset-listing-parameter-upda) role via governance. Each function on the contract can be implemented via the `ShortExecutor` whilst also having the ability to assign and remove, a `AssetManager` role to a community elected address. There is also the possibility of having an IncentiveManager contract that could take on some of the listed functions defined above. These details will be worked through in the future.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance. The [ARFC] \npublication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].\n\n# Disclosure\n\n@llamaxyz is a service provider to Aave DAO. Llama is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is compensated by only Aave DAO for creating this ARFC. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This publication catalogs TokenLogic's past and ongoing involvements with the Aave DAO, acknowledging the team's valuable contributions while also establishing a path for a seamless transition in alignment with the outcome of the Request For Proposal process.\n\nThe lists below encompass most of our contributions thus far, excluding efforts on projects that didn't materialize. Additionally, we have outlined a limited scope of forthcoming work that we intend to undertake as part of this funding proposal.\n\n## 15 Submitted AIPs\n\n* [AIP-354 - Transfer Assets From Polygon to Ethereum Treasury](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/?proposalId=354)\n* [AIP-353 - Reserve Update October](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/?proposalId=353)\n* [AIP-347 - GHO Funding](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/)\n* [AIP-343 - Fund GHO Liquidity Committee](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/343/)\n* [AIP-334 - Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/334/)\n* [AIP-333 - Treasury Management - Create AGD GHO Allowance](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/333/)\n* [AIP-328 - Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/328/)\n* [AIP-312 - Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/312/)\n* [Guardian - Treasury Management - Avalanche v2 to v3 Migiration](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/304/)\n* [AIP-303 - Treasury Management - Polygon v2 to v3 Migration](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/303/) this requires a rerun\n* [AIP-300 - stMATIC Supply Cap](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/300/)\n* [AIP-284 - Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/284/)\n* [AIP-273 - Add ARB to Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/273/)\n* [AIP-260 - Add FRAX Ethereum Aave v3](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/260/)\n* [AIP-259 - Add FRAX Arbitrum Aave v3](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/259/)\n* [AIP Polygon v2 - Parameter Update](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/250/)\n\n## 8-9 Planned AIPs\n\n* 2-3 AIPs relating to [DAO's runway](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194)\n* 1 AIP [acquiring rETH](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x80493cdca3b1893e198802cd245e6e3c00f5fcd0b37c09aa41765b17419a71fe)\n* 1 AIP to migrate Polygon Treasury from v2 to v3\n* 2 AIPs increasing [RF on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-reserve-factor-updates-polygon-aave-v2/13937/8)\n* 1 AIP to upgrade SAM for [vlAURA holding](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-vlaura/15323)\n\n## 5 ARFC \n\n* [ARFC Safety Module - Polygon & Avalanche Coverage Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-safety-module-polygon-avalanche-coverage-update/14810)\n* [ARFC Treasury Management - Amend Safety Module AAVE Emissions](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936)\n* [ARFC Treasury Management - GHO Liquidity Strategy Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801)\n* [ARFC Treasury Management - Acquire AURA](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-acquire-aura/14683)\n* [ARFC Aave Funding Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194)\n\n## 7 Proposals Beyond Aave\n\n* [SIPS-084 Turbo GHO Co-Incentives](https://community.sommelier.finance/t/sips-084-turbo-gho-co-incentives/1194)\n * [BIP-357 Enable GHO/LUSD Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-357-enable-gho-lusd-gauge-ethereum/4963)\n * [BIP-360 Enable GHO/bb-a-USD Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-360-enable-gho-bb-a-usd-gauge-ethereum/4965)\n * [BIP-413 Kill GHO Gauges Week 35](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-413-kill-gho-gauges-week-35/5144)\n * [BIP-358 Enable GHO/wstETH Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-358-enable-gho-wsteth-gauge-ethereum/4964)\n * [BIP-411 Enable GHO/USDT/USDC Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-411-enable-gho-usdt-usdc-gauge-ethereum/5135)\n * [TRC-92 - Enable GHO/USDC Gauge](https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/13698-trc92-enable-ghousdc-gauge-no-cap)\n* [ TRC-102 Enable GHO/USDC Gauge [Ethereum]](https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/13900-trc102-enable-ghousdc-gauge-ethereum)\n\n## Analytics Platform\n\n* [GHO Analytics Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/)\n\nFurther details about this initiative can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-analytics-by-tokenlogic/14067). \n\n## GHO Launch Support\n\nTokenLogic coordinated the BAL and AURA incentives to support launching GHO on Balancer.\n\nThe table below provides a conservative estimate of the value of the voting support:\n\n|Asset|Amount|Duration|Quest Price| Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|vlAURA| 400,000|12 weeks|$0.0085|$40,800|\n|veBAL|165,000|12 weeks|$0.045|$89,100|\n\nThe Aura Finance team extended their support with 400,000 vlAURA for a duration of three months. In the initial weeks, dedicated members of the Balancer community contributed over 4% of the veBAL supply. The table provided above is based on an assumption that accounts for 2.5% of veBAL supply in July and considers the current veBAL Quest price. It's important to note that this data underestimates the actual value of the votes that TokenLogic procured and offers significant context for readers.\n\nIt's important to note that some voters may have opted to support GHO pools independently, without requiring active engagement from the Aave community.\n\n# Terms\n\nWe request an additional $115k for the work detailed above, bringing the total compensation to $130k.\n\nThis figure was derived from wages and software licenses used to support hosting the GHO Analytics platform.\n\n# Specification\n\nIf this proposal is approved, the amount is to be transferred to a TokenLogic-controlled account (`0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`) as the recipient.\n\nThe transfer will be equivalent to $115k USD in GHO.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
