    "summary": "The proposal to allocate 125,000 ARB tokens to the Arbitrum community Arbiters for their extensive early contributions is supported by strong early vote momentum, substantial community discussion, and positive sentiment from key delegates and DAOs. The Arbiters have made significant contributions in community support, moderation, education, translation, and promotion over 2.5 years without prior retroactive rewards except for limited USDC from the Foundation. While some delegates raise concerns about fairness and selection criteria, the overwhelming consensus supports a one-time retroactive reward recognizing the unique role of Arbiters. This proposal aligns with precedent retroactive rewards in other DAOs and respects the Foundation's previous USDC compensation. Market impacts are neutral to positive, and similar past proposals indicate stable outcomes.",
