The ecosystem ONsites aim to address these by fostering genuine connections, enhancing collaboration, and reinforcing our web3 culture.\n\n## TLDR:\n\n* Balancer OpCo Limited will take 14 contributors from the Balancer ecosystem to DevCon 7, in Bangkok, from 12-15 Nov, 2024. :thailand:\n* Proposal includes two extra days for delagging, side events and coworking.\n* Request is capped at $45,762.\n\n## Summary\n\nBalancer is a big think-tank! Twice a year, the Balancer ecosystem hosts a meet-up for DAO contributors and Balancer Labs employees to get together. This is where ideas flourish, bonds become unbreakable and real facetime creates experiences that can last a lifetime.\n\nFor reference, see the last three previous editions here: [Lisbon](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-520-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q2-2024/5461), [Milan](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-520-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q2-2024/5461), [Barcelona](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-april-2023-ops-update/4736) (also Bogota and Denver).\n\nAfter the last edition in Lisbon, we collected some valuable feedback. One key takeaway was that 80% of the contributors “*would go anywhere*”, and 35% “*rather have these events when there’s a crypto event next to it*”. In addition, 55% suggested *Asia* as the next destination.\n\nWe decided to cater to that opportunity! :slight_smile: \n\nDevCon 7 is taking place in Southeast Asia, from Nov 12-15, and it is undeniably a top tier irl event for the DeFi and Ethereum communities. This proposal seeks to allocate resources to send 14 contributors to Bangkok, Thailand, fostering collaboration and strengthening the Balancer ecosystem, while connecting with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nUnlike previous editions, this one will be focused solely on the attendance to Devcon as the main event, so we would like to secure tickets (and builders discounts) as fast as possible. While we will have some extra expenses (tickets and flights at a higher cost) we expect to make savings with less group activities and meeting rooms, also dropping the travel agent so we can book our own plans and move faster.\n\n## Objectives\n\n**1. Strengthen Team Bonds:** Create opportunities for employees to connect on a personal level, building trust and camaraderie.\n**2. Enhance Collaboration:** Facilitate cross-functional interaction and knowledge sharing to spark innovation and drive productivity.\n**3. Reinforce Web3 Culture:** Deepen understanding and alignment with our core values, fostering a sense of belonging to the broader Ethereum ecosystem.\n**4. Celebrate Success & Motivate:** Recognize achievements and inspire continued commitment to our shared goals, specially with the launch of v3 and other produt releases like CowAMM and zenUI.\n\n## Pre & Post-Retreat Engagement\n\n* Pre-Retreat Virtual Events and Groupchats: Virtual icebreakers and team-building activities to build excitement and connections.\n* Post-Retreat Follow-Up: Feedback form to learn what we did right, and where we can improve to maintain momentum and connection.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n\n* **Improved Team Cohesion & Morale**: Stronger relationships and a greater sense of belonging.\n* **Enhanced Collaboration & Productivity**: Increased cross-functional communication and knowledge sharing, leading to innovative solutions and improved workflows.\n* **Reinforced Web3 Culture**: Deeper understanding of Ethereum ecosystem and alignment with our values, fostering a positive and engaged workforce.\n* **Increased Motivation & Retention**: A sense of appreciation and investment in contributor growth, leading to higher motivation and loyalty.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe acknowledge the current market conditions and budgetary constraints. The proposed budget is intentionally conservative and may not fully cover all attendee travel expenses. Balancer OpCo will prioritize cost-effectiveness while mindful to ensure a positive experience for contributors traveling a significant distance.\n\nThis proposal seeks to allocate resources to take 14 contributors to Bangkok.\n\nBalancer Labs: 4 - tech and scc advisory\nMaxis: 4 - bizdev, devrel and protocol operation\nBalancer OpCo: 3 - product, UI/UX, admin and compliance\nBeethoven: 2 - marketing\nGrants: 1 - devrel, hooks\n\nBreakdown\n$17,800 Flights\n$14,400 Accommodations\n$5,962 Tickets\n$4,800 Meals and per diems\n$2,800 Team activities\n\nTotal request for Devcon 7 allocation: `$45,762`\n\nNote: These are initial estimates. We'll continue to seek cost savings while ensuring a valuable and enjoyable experience for all attendees.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe ecosystem ONsites are investments in our most valuable asset: our community. By fostering connections, collaboration, and a shared sense of purpose, we can strengthen our DAO culture, drive innovation, and achieve greater success together.\n\nWe are confident that this Bangkok edition will be a transformative experience for our team, strengthening our bond and propelling us at Devcon 7 towards greater achievements.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, this proposal authorizes OpCo to plan the event attendance within the specified budget. No token transferred are required at this time, as funds are already unallocated on OpCo's wallet.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/308\n\nHello Balancer Community!\n\nHistorically Orb has included the cost of our ONsites into its funding requests. We’ve decided to change that and request a separate, standalone proposal for these events starting with the one we are hoping to have in Q4 of this year. I know it might seem super early to start planning for this, but fear not, we are right on time. We need to get started on location selection because hotel blocks for groups of our size fill up many months in advance.\n\nWe are requesting 93,750 USDC to pay for 25 attendees:\n\n* Maxis: 7\n* Beethoven: 3\n* Integrations (Orbies): 3\n* Grants: 1\n* Foundation: 2\n* OpCo: 5\n* Other Ecosystem Contributors: 4\n\nBalancer Labs will pay for the costs of its attendees.\n\nAs a reminder, the goals of our ecosystem ONsites are to facilitate 1) in-person brainstorms and collaboration meetings and 2) team bonding. We have found the optimal cadence for in-person gatherings to be twice per year. Gathering the ecosystem together in person to discuss, debate and learn from things that went well and didn’t go well over the last six months has proven to be super valuable.\n\nThe agenda for each ONsite includes a Retrospective Meeting to review the last 6 months of work across the ecosystem), a Funding Meeting to plan the roadmap of projects that the ecosystem will work on in the next 6 months, and meetings that are reflective on what’s timely at the time of the event (ie, KPIs, marketing, regulatory, technical vision, mission/vision/values). Having the space and time to hold these meetings in person has been significantly more impactful for our team than having them virtually. In-person meetings allow more fluid conversations and attendees are more likely to build positive relationships through them. Contributors are also able to collaboratively brainstorm easier in person rather than virtually.\n\nHere is some feedback that we received in our follow-up survey after our Q4 2022 ONsite:\n\n* “ONsites are a must for remote-first companies.” - BLabs contributor\n* “Getting to know everyone personally [was my favorite part]. It created an even better feeling when doing video calls now.” - BLabs contributor\n* “Being able to meet the smart contracts team and ask them some questions [was my favorite part].” - OpCo contributor\n* “The organization was great overall and I’ve really enjoyed the experience and getting to know my co-contributors in person :)” - BLabs contributor\n* “We were reasonably frugal.” - BLabs contributor\n* “It was an amazing experience.” - Orb contributor\n* “I found that just a sole opportunity to meet the team and exchange ideas was very valuable.” - BLabs contributor\n\nWe are asking for funding based on our best estimate of what the total ecosystem headcount will be in Q4. If we have more attendees than what we budgeted for, we will need to request additional funding. If we have less, we will return excess funds to the OpCo. It’s worth noting that if that additional funding is not approved we won’t be able to invite new ecosystem members to this ONsite.\n\nWe are estimating that each attendee will cost 3,750 USDC for our five day/four night event. Breakdown of this cost:\n\n* Travel (Flights/Airport Transfers): 1,229 USDC/person\n* Overnight Accommodations: 928 USDC/person\n* Meeting Room Rentals: 82 USDC/person\n* Meals: 594 USDC/person\n* Activities: 332 USDC/person\n* Misc Expenses (ie, covid tests, meeting supplies, etc): 27 USDC/person\n* Canvas Meetings organizer fee: 399 USDC/person\n  * Includes sourcing, contracting, pre-planning, budget management, food & beverage management, vendor and all event logistics management.\n* ONsite event coordinator: 159 USDC/person\n  * Includes 24/7 dedication to our group ensuring everything goes smoothly from start to finish of the event. They monitor and assist with incoming and outgoing travel and make sure that all meetings, meals and activities are set up correctly and go on without a hitch.\n\nWhen planning these events we are always looking for ways to achieve our goals with a cost conscious lens on. Examples of this are not covering costs for flight upgrades and a mix of per diem meals and shared meals versus all shared meals. The Q4 event will be no different. For any funds that aren’t used for this event, we will keep those in our ONsite account and apply it to the next one.\n\nEdit:\n\nThis a capped budget and funds will flow directly through OpCo and OpCo’s wallet. Unused funds can be returned to Treasury. With Orb sunsetting, organization will be handled by Maxis together with OpCo for logistics and BLabs for their own contributors.\n\nIf approved, DAO Treasury 0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f will transfer 93,750 USD to OpCo's wallet 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 to cover ONsite expenses\n\nOpCo’s multisig to receive funds: 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693",

Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to enhance Balancer's presence at key live events in the Crypto and DeFi space as part of our marketing strategy for the launch of Balancer v3. Attending these events will help us improve brand visibility, establish thought leadership, showcase technological innovations, foster valuable networking opportunities, and deepen community engagement.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Motivation\n\nIn-person events are crucial for building and maintaining valuable relationships within the crypto community. They provide unique opportunities to present our latest developments, engage with thought leaders, and gather insights directly from our user base and potential partners. Specifically, the launch of Balancer v3 requires heightened visibility and strategic engagement to amplify its reach and aid adoption. Attending these events will provide Balancer with unparalleled opportunities to promote v3, build strategic partnerships, and engage with our community. This is a cost-effective approach to maximize our marketing efforts and ensure the successful launch of Balancer v3.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Goals and Objectives\n\nTo maximize our impact at live events, we have narrowed our focus to four key areas:\n\n### Brand Visibility and Thought Leadership\n\n- **Objective:** Enhance Balancer's brand presence and position the protocol as a thought leader in DeFi.\n- **Actions:** Engage in key speaking opportunities, contribute to panel discussions on future trends, and share insights on DeFi's evolution. (CEO, CTO)\n\n### Showcase Technological Innovation\n\n- **Objective:** Demonstrate the capabilities, benefits, and new features of Balancer v3.\n- **Actions:** Host workshops, curate hackathons, participate in panels, and coordinate events with key partners. (Blabs, Maxis)\n\n### Networking and Partnerships\n\n- **Objective:** Establish and strengthen relationships with developers, potential partners, and other influential players in the crypto industry.\n- **Actions:** Attend networking events, host side events and social meet-ups to foster relationships with key prospects. (Maxis, Marketing)\n\n### Community Engagement\n\n- **Objective:** Deepen engagement with the crypto community and gather valuable insights.\n- **Actions:** Host meet-ups, participate in social events, leverage social media and branded merchandise for engagement and giveaways. (Marketing)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Specification\n\n### Event Participation Plan\n\nWe propose to attend the following key events:\n\n- **ETHCC (July 8 - 11):**\nETHCC presents an opportunity for us to sow the seeds of connection for community and partnership goals. Rather than focusing on speaking at the main event, our goal is to organize social events and invest energy in grassroots networking. This event will also help us identify areas for improvement for future events.\n- **Token2049 (September) and Devcon (November):**\nFor these events, we will focus on establishing thought leadership by participating in key speaking opportunities and organizing a panel event with key partners to heighten awareness around v3 and its technology. Additionally, we will organize social events to complement the main activities. The goal is to align our impact with the launch of v3 and have ample time to prepare speakers and official events.\n\n### Key Activities\n\n- **ETHCC:ETHCC:**\n    - **Host a Side Event with Key Guests:**\n        - We will organize a side event featuring both prominent guests building on Balancer such as Gyro, CowSwap, and Quant, as well as notable partners such as Aave, Lido, Rocket Pool, Karpatkey. This gathering will provide a unique platform to bring together influential figures and key partners within the Balancer ecosystem.\n    - **Activities:**\n        - **Networking:** Facilitate informal networking sessions to help attendees connect with industry leaders and peers. This will provide opportunities for meaningful discussions and potential collaborations.\n        - **Social Events:** Organize social activities that encourage relaxed and personal interactions, allowing participants to build stronger, more personal connections.\n        - Merchandise: Enhance our presence and create lasting impressions with branded merchandise that capture the essence of the Balancer brand.\n- **Token2049 and Devcon:**\n    - **Key Contributors and Panel Discussions:**\n        - **Arrange for Key Contributors to Speak:** We will ensure that influential voices from Balancer, participate in speaking opportunities. Their insights and expertise will highlight Balancer v3's innovations and impact on the DeFi space.\n        - **Host Panel Discussions with Key Partners:** Collaborate with leading projects like Gyro, CowSwap, and Quant to organize panel discussions around protocols building on Balancer. These panels will focus on the advancements of Balancer v3 and its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem, providing a platform for thought leadership and in-depth discussions.\n    - **Hackathons:**\n        - **Participate in Hackathons:** Potentially engage in hackathons during Token2049 and Devcon to demonstrate Balancer v3's technical prowess and encourage innovative uses of our platform. Our team will be available to support participants, answer questions, and provide guidance on integrating Balancer’s technology.\n        - **Host a Balancer-Sponsored Hackathon:** Organize a Balancer-specific hackathon challenge to incentivize developers to build on top of Balancer v3. Winners can receive rewards and recognition, promoting creativity and highlighting the versatility of our platform.\n    - **Additional Social Events:**\n        - **Engage with the Wider Community:** Host informal social events, such as meet-and-greets, dinners, and networking mixers, to foster personal connections and engage with the DeFi community. These gatherings will provide a relaxed environment for meaningful interactions and relationship-building.\n        \n    ---\n    \n### 5. Implementation\n\n### Rough Timeline\n\n- **May - June:** Finalize event plans, secure speakers, and coordinate logistics.\n- **July:** Attend ETHCC, host side event.\n- **August - September:** Prepare for Token2049, develop presentation materials, and confirm participation.\n- **September:** Attend Token2049, and engage in speaking opportunities and panels.\n- **October - November:** Prepare for Devcon, and finalize hackathon details.\n- **November:** Attend Devcon, and participate in hackathons and panels.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Budget Considerations\n\nBelow is a rough budget for participation at ETHCC:\n\n| Category | Item | Cost per Unit (EUR) | Quantity | Total Cost (EUR) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tickets | Event Ticket (standard price) | 750 | 10 | 7,500 |\n| Travel | Flights/Trains (per person) | 1,000 | 10 | 10,000 |\n| Accommodation | Hotel (3-4 star, 5 nights) | 1250 | 10 | 12,500 |\n| Promo and Merch | Branded Merchandise | 5000 | 1 | 5,000 |\n| Social Events | Hosting Side Events | 10,000 | 1 | 10,000 |\n| Miscellaneous | Per Diem | 75 | 10 | 750 |\n| Total | Estimated Total | - | - | 45,750 |\n\n**Note:** The subsequent events would follow a similar budget structure, with potential adjustments based on our experiences at EthCC.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Specific Ask for Funding**\n\nWe are requesting funding from the Balancer DAO to cover the costs associated with attending these key events. The estimated total budget for ETHCC is 45,750 EUR, and we anticipate similar costs for Token2049 and Devcon, adjusted for any improvements based on our ETHCC experience. This funding will cover accommodations, event tickets, per diem costs, transportation, promotional materials, expenses related to hosting social events, and hackathon participation.\n\nOpCo will manage all payments and spending related to these events, ensuring efficient use of funds. The required budget will be sourced from the unallocated grants held by OpCo, ensuring that the expenditure aligns with our overall financial planning and support for the Balancer community.\n\nAdditionally, any unspent funds from these allocations will be rolled over to future events or initiatives, ensuring continued support and financial prudence in our promotional activities.\n\nBy securing this funding, we aim to maximize our impact at these events, promoting Balancer v3, fostering new partnerships, and enhancing our engagement with the DeFi community.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Success, Reporting, and Improvement\n\n### Reporting\n\nAfter each event, we will provide a detailed report to the Balancer DAO that includes:\n\n- Summary of activities and participation.\n- Key outcomes and metrics.\n- Photos and videos from the events.\n- Financial report detailing the actual expenses.\n\n### Continuous Improvement\n\nBased on the feedback and experiences from each event, we will:\n\n- Identify areas for improvement for future events.\n- Adjust our strategy and activities to maximize impact.\n- Share best practices and lessons learned with the community.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Conclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to secure funding for Balancer's strategic participation in key live events. By enhancing our presence at these events, we aim to significantly contribute to the successful launch of Balancer v3 and strengthen our position in the DeFi.\n\n**Specification**:\n\nNo technical specification required as funding will be supported by OpCo in this scenario; not interacting with the DAO Multisig directly.",

        "title": "[BIP-697] BD Service Provider Proposal for Q4 2024 to Q1 2025",
        "author": "0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17",
        "body": "PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1356\n\n# Introduction\n\nOver the last 9 months, the BD Service Provider (BDSP) has gone from a brand new entity in Q1 to an integral part of Balancer. The BDSP, in partnership with the Maxis and other contributors to Balancer, has helped drive partnerships, liquidity, relationships, and opportunities for Balancer throughout the EVM ecosystem. Numerous partners have commented how they prefer to work with Balancer over other DEXs because of the support they receive from the BDSP and Maxis, and Balancer receives countless inbound requests from prospective partners because of existing partners spreading this via word-of-mouth.\n\nGiven the BDSP has become an integral part of Balancer’s growth strategy, we aim to switch to bi-annual funding starting in Q4 2024. This provides us with more funding stability and also guarantees that resources for the upcoming Balancer v3 launch will be adequately allocated.\n\n# Priorities and Initiatives\n\nThe BDSP will focus on the following priorities and specific initiatives during 4Q24 and 1Q25. For background, the BDSP has shown a consistent track record executing against the proposed initiatives during Q1-Q3. For Q3 performance reports please see [July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bdsp-july-update/5914) and [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bdsp-august-update/5990) reports.\n\n## Initiative 1: Foster growth of the Balancer v2 protocol\n\n**Summary**\n\nWhile every SP plays an important role in generating new opportunities for Balancer, the BDSP’s primary responsibility is finding ways to generate opportunities for Balancer. One of the primary focuses of the BDSP will be continuing to find areas of growth and executing on them.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Execute liquidity strategy on Balancer v2**\n    - Prioritize yield-bearing assets (LSTs, LRTs, ibStables) or primary strategic assets to generate revenue for Balancer\n    - Find opportunities to deploy new pools on key strategic chains, which includes new pools of Balancer ecosystem projects (e.g. Gyroscope, CowAMM)\n    - Make sure Balancer stays on top of new metas (e.g. BTC LRTs, Veda vaults, etc.)\n    - Retain key strategic liquidity in existing pools\n    - Make sure governance requirements are completed to secure liquidity from partners, where necessary (e.g. AAVE, Frax)\n\n2. **Solicit new partnerships**\n    - Be proactive by finding new prospective partners, reaching out, and engaging in discussions\n    - Be the primary point of contact for inbound partnership inquiries\n    - Facilitate internal discussions for partner evaluation\n\n3. **Grant and incentive programs**\n    - Find grant/incentive programs applicable to Balancer\n    - Apply for these programs\n    - Execute the program, where necessary\n\n4. **Execute veMODE program on Mode**\n    - Launch innovative, ecosystem-wide veMODE program, which leverages a MODE 8020 pool to direct $OP and $MODE rewards to protocols on Mode, in partnership with Mode and Aragon\n    - Work with members of Maxis to coordinate incentive programs and partner incentive management\n    - Collaborate with partners on Mode and the Mode team to generate new pools and acquire liquidity on Mode.\n\n## Initiative 2: Support the launch of Balancer v3 and facilitate growth and adoption.\n\n**Summary**\n\nAlong with the Maxis, the BDSP will play a meaningful role in establishing relationships and partnerships both pre and post v3’s launch.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Plan and execute on v3 launch**\n    - Work with BLabs and Maxis to finalize rollout plan\n    - Educate new and existing partners on v3 and how they can leverage for new opportunities\n    - Drive v3 liquidity with partners across chains\n    - Support Marketing and BLabs to drive developer engagement and new products\n\n2. **Support deployments on strategic chains**\n    - Work together with the Maxis on chain deployments\n    - Coordinate expansion plans with ecosystem partners\n\n3. **Collaborate with Maxis to advance Balancer tokenomics and the DAOs revenue strategy**\n4. **Continue supporting engineering with aggregator integrations and other technical partnership needs (as necessary)**\n    - Example: working with BLabs to ensure all aggregators are engaged and the partnership between Balancer/BLabs and aggregators is being supported.\n\n## Initiative 3: Partner Support\n\n**Summary**\n\nAs mentioned above, one of Balancer’s strategic advantages - in addition to its technology - is the level of care and support it provides partners. The ‘white glove’ service Balancer offers is exhibited from SPs across the DAO, but the BDSP will continue playing its role as mentioned below.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Onboard new partners into the Balancer ecosystem**\n    - Help advise on pool type strategy and incentive strategy\n    - Guide through governance / Aura processes and timelines\n    - Help facilitate rate provider review needs and drive to completion in timely fashion\n    - Help facilitate partners’ Points information being included on the Balancer UI (where applicable)\n\n2. **Work closely with Marketing to support co-promotion of new and existing partners**\n3. **Be the primary point of contact, along with members of Maxis, for partners’ non-technical needs. Be responsive and helpful at all times.**\n4. **Continue seeking ways to eliminate friction for partner onboarding**\n    - Example: collaborate with Maxis and Chainlink to utilize CCIP to expedite rate provider deployments\n\n## **Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Business Development Service Provider\n\n**Contributors:** Lipman\n\nPledge to abide by [[BIP-629]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-629-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards: Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* Partner Management\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n1. **Strategy and Business Development**\n    - Develop and execute liquidity strategies for Balancer v2, focusing on yield-bearing and strategic assets (LSTs, LRTs, ibStables).\n    - Identify and deploy new pools on key strategic chains to drive ecosystem growth (e.g., Gyroscope, CowAMM).\n    - Stay ahead of market trends and metas (e.g., BTC LRTs, Veda vaults) to ensure Balancer's competitive positioning.\n    - Lead efforts to attract new partnerships by engaging with potential collaborators and evaluating partnership opportunities.\n    - Execute governance processes to secure liquidity and incentives from key partners (e.g., AAVE, Frax).\n    - Launch and manage innovative incentive programs like the veMODE initiative, in collaboration with Mode and Aragon.\n    - Collaborate with BLabs and Maxis on the successful rollout of Balancer v3, driving partner liquidity and product adoption.\n\n2. **Partner Support**\n    - Provide ‘white glove’ support to new and existing partners, guiding them through pool creation, governance, and incentive strategies.\n    - Serve as the primary point of contact for partners, ensuring prompt and effective responses to their needs.\n    - Assist partners in navigating Balancer’s ecosystem, including advising on pool types, rate providers, and governance timelines.\n    - Work closely with marketing teams to co-promote new and existing partnerships across the ecosystem.\n    - Streamline partner onboarding by identifying and eliminating friction points, such as collaborating with Chainlink to utilize CCIP for faster rate provider deployments.\n    - Continuously engage with partners to optimize revenue generation and liquidity retention strategies, ensuring long-term success for both parties.\n\n**Reporting**\n\nThe BDSP has provided weekly updates in the DAO-wide Ballers meeting on Mondays, a separate weekly update with the Maxis and Marketing teams on Thursdays, and monthly reports posted to the forum. The BDSP will update the ecosystem and community participants regularly through weekly meetings and monthly community reports:\n\n**Weekly Ecosystem Meeting**\n    - Inform ecosystem participants of our weekly progress and planned activities\n    - Coordinate collaborations and issues with other ecosystem stakeholders\n\n**Monthly reports**\n    - Write up detailed monthly reports on key objectives\n    - Provide a financial statement of the usage of discretionary funds as in previous funding rounds\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nThe BDSP spent $2k of its Q3 $6k discretionary budget for a part-time contributor during August/September who will not be contributing going forward. The $4k of savings are being requested to roll over to Q424/Q125 at the team's discretion for non-people costs and/or part-time contributors.\n\nThe BDSP has 1 FTE and will be reducing its proposed cost from the [Q3 BDSP funding proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-635-business-development-sp-proposal-for-q3-2024/5798) to $14k/mo in Q4-Q1 vs. $15k/mo in Q3 as well as not asking for any additional discretionary budget. This amount is inclusive of both USDC and vesting BAL amounts.\n\nThe combination of the reduced monthly cost and reduced discretionary budget will result in a $9k savings per quarter for the DAO.\n\nA detailed breakdown of proposed costs is visualized below:\n\n![image|659x500, 75%](upload://xOGL4BZX0DBhoRD5LUIm2Mav4w8.png)\n\n\nLength of engagement: 6 months\n\nBudget: 72,000 USDC and 6,780 BAL\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a\n\nImpact on the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold 3,507,473 BAL. Funding the BDSP for the next half year would impact 0.19% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 0.38% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 5.727mln in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 1.25% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 2.5%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer passing the BDSP Safe 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a as recipient and amount 72000 USDC as 72000000000.\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with BAL 0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D by writing transfer passing the BDSP Safe 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a as recipient and amount 6780 as 6780000000000000000000.",

As a leading player in the rapidly growing DeFi space, Balancer recognizes the importance of providing a seamless and efficient trading environment for its governance token.\n\nBy partnering with a reputable market maker, Balancer will aim to achieve increased liquidity that enables traders to enter and exit positions with minimal slippage, attracting a wider range of participants and fostering greater adoption of the Balancer protocol. This improved market depth will enhance price stability across exchanges, while reducing volatility and instilling confidence in BAL token holders, fostering governance participation.\n\nA robust presence in central exchanges will contribute to a healthier and more vibrant ecosystem, benefiting all stakeholders involved in the Balancer project.\n\nGiven the recent [announcement ](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-extend-the-monitoring-tag-to-include-bal-ctxc-cvp-cvx-dock-hard-iris-mbl-pols-snt-sun-and-remove-the-monitoring-tag-for-mln-zen-on-2024-07-01-782b121c462b499487dc8f20e0edc6b2)from Binance to include BAL in its Monitoring Tag list as of July 1st, 2024, due to heightened volatility and risk concerns, it has now become a focus of the Balancer community to address and mitigate these issues.\n\nGiven the competitive nature of the DeFi landscape, Balancer believes this engagement is a strategic imperative, ensuring its continued listing and long-term success. By partnering with a firm that possesses the expertise, resources, and track record to deliver exceptional results, Balancer is confident in its ability to further solidify its position as a leading player in the DeFi space and continue to drive innovation.\n\n# Proposal:\n\nIn order to facilitate the business negotiation process where signing of mutual NDAs are required and comply with regulatory requirements, we request this to be done from within the Foundation/OpCo environment, with the advisory of different Balancer DAO contributors, including Karpatkey.\n\nTo address the challenges outlined above and achieve our objectives, the core terms of this engagement may include:\n\n1. Token Loan: Balancer DAO will grant 1,000,000 BAL tokens to Balancer OpCo, which will be able to lend out this partial/full amount to the selected market maker for a maximum period of 18 months.\n2. Call Options: Balancer OpCo is open to negotiating call options for the market maker, allowing them to purchase loaned or additional BAL tokens at pre-determined strike prices.\n3. Repayment Terms and Strikes: Repayment terms and strike prices ranges will be determined through a collaborative negotiation process, taking into account the desired outcomes for both parties.\n4. Multiple Tranches and Tenors: The loan can be structured into multiple tranches with varying tenors, allowing for greater flexibility and customization based on the desirable strategies.\n5. Compliant Onboarding: Balancer OpCo is committed to ensuring the market maker has a compliant onboarding process for Balancer. This includes adhering to all relevant regulations and conducting thorough due diligence to mitigate any potential risks.\n6. Additional Listings: Balancer OpCo may weigh in the negotiations with market makers and potential Tier 2 exchanges listings of interest, increasing BAL participation on the global market, such as OKX, Bybit, Kucoin etc.\n\nResults are to be followed by DAO contributors and Karpatkey, and published on the forum regularly by OpCo.\n\n# Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d` by writing transfer passing the OpCo multisig `0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693` as recipient (verifiable in [DAO address book](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/6bf041030893125f40891fcf7801a6e1207aca85/extras/multisigs.json#L13)) and amount as 1000000 BAL `1000000000000000000000000`.",
