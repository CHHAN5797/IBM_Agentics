Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Launch Aave V3 on Kava EVM \n\nAuthor: [Various Kava Ecosystem Contributors]\n\nCreated: 2023-12-12\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nKAVA in collaboration with PGov and Michigan Blockchain propose the integration of Aave V3 with KAVA. KAVA’s EVM compatibility and integration will be a crucial advancement for the Aave multichain vision. The integration will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Cosmos and enables Cosmos ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through KAVA\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to be a starting point in the process of bringing Aave to the KAVA Ecosystem and aims to provide necessary details to the Aave community to consider the merits of KAVA integration. Kava has been building out the cornerstones of a solid DeFi ecosystem since mainnet launch in 2022. The key dexes in the ecosystem are Kinetix (a Uniswap v3 dex plus perpetual trading platform built by the Quickswap team from Polygon), WAGMI (protocol owned liquidity dex), and Equilibre (a ve3,3 dex). There are a few burgeoning lending protocols on the chain, but with the team’s plans to deprecate the existing leading lending protocol on the Cosmos SDK side, Kava Lend, there exists an incredible opportunity for a blue chip lending protocol like Aave to establish market dominance on the EVM side.\n\nIn addition to the market opportunity, the Kava ecosystem has an ongoing incentive program called the Kava Rise program which incentivizes protocol usage pro-rata based on TVL per protocol. Currently 1M Kava is being distributed per month to protocols pro-rata. Due to the proclivity for lending protocols to attract a significant portion of TVL in an ecosystem, Aave stands to earn the majority of these rewards. The current distribution of rewards is 1M Kava per month, and can increase pending governance approval as the ecosystem matures.\n\nThe Kava Foundation has committed to providing liquidity mining rewards of a minimum of 1M Kava guaranteed over the first year for the Aave community.\n\n*Benefits of deploying on Kava*\n\nWith the KAVA integration, Aave gets additional markets with Market Cap of $740M, ~200M of locked liquidity, native assets like ATOM, USDT, WBTC and more. KAVA itself is connected well within the Cosmos ecosystem, thus the integration will also enable the cosmos community to plug its deep $60Bn liquidity to Aave through KAVA.\n\n- Kava today is the 12th largest chain by TVL, and 9th by number of deployed protocols as per DefiLlama 2\n- Kava is an EVM built on top of the Cosmos SDK, this also facilitates bringing Cosmos assets (like ATOM) natively onto the Protocol, which is not possible on other EVMs. AAVE has the opportunity to connect trading in the Cosmos and Ethereum.\n- Kava is the largest of such an EVM chain with native Cosmos integration capabilities.\n\n*Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment*\n\nIn addition, Kava has recently garnered a partnership with Tether, as Tether selected Kava to be the native USDT distributor across the Cosmos. In other words, if a user wants an IBC denominated USDT that’s natively issued by Tether, that USDT needs to originate from Kava. In just a few short months, there has been over $150M USDT natively issued on the Kava blockchain.\n\nWETH is also available as an OFT on Kava via Stargate, and WBTC will soon be issued natively on Kava by Bitgo as well. This provides a plethora of native asset markets for Aave on Kava with deep liquidity.\n\nSome other bluechip deployments on Kava include Curve Finance, Beefy Finance, and an upcoming deployment from Yearn Finance as well.\n\nKava’s latest partnership with Tether, Bitgo, LayerZero and other DApps mentioned above signify its steady commitment to provide a top of the line DeFi ecosystem to users.\n\nOne unique benefit of an Aave v3 deployment on Kava is that Aave would be able to open up Cosmos based markets like ATOM natively on the EVM, which is currently not available on any other chain. We believe this opportunity to open up the Cosmos world to Aave presents a significant opportunity for the community.\n\n# Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Kava Foundation has done a good job of managing its treasury in this recent bear market. Currently the treasury stands at ~360M Kava. The Foundation is happy to seed liquidity in initial markets with up to 50M Kava over the first year.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Kava Rise reward program exists to reward protocols pro-rata based on the amount TVL each project has on a monthly basis. With the commitment to seed liquidity, and the market opportunity for Aave to overtake the soon-to-be deprecated existing Kava Lend protocol, Aave has a clear opportunity to establish TVL and market dominance within the Kava ecosystem, and thereby earn a significant portion of existing 1M Kava/month liquidity mining rewards.\n\nIn short, not only will Kava Foundation commit to seeding liquidity, but that seeded liquidity will also drive the flywheel of liquidity mining rewards for Aave users on Kava.\n\nRegardless of TVL, at a bare minimum, the Kava Foundation will commit to 1M Kava in liquidity mining rewards over the first year for the Aave community. It is completely up to the Aave community how it wants to use these rewards.\n\n*About Kava Rise Program*\n\nKava Rise is an on-chain reward program that rewards builders on Kava. Rewards are distributed monthly on a pro-rata basis on the amount of TVL each project has. The current reward distribution is 1M Kava per month. And this amount can change/increase based on governance as the ecosystem continues to mature.\n\nRead more about the Kava Rise program [here](https://www.kava.io/developer-rewards).\n\n# Helpful Links\n\n- Audit 1: Kava - [CertiK Skynet Project Insight](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kava)\n- Documentation: [https://docs.kava.io](https://docs.kava.io/docs/intro/)\n- Explorers: [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/kava), [Kavascan](https://kavascan.com/)\n- [KAVA Ecosystem overview](https://www.kava.io/ecosystem)\n- Kave [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chain/Kava)\n- [Kava Rise Program](https://www.kava.io/developer-rewards)\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired.

This includes specifics on how Aave’s lending and borrowing functionalities will interact with new Aave Deployment. For that, please share the result of both documentation submission and technical review, from TEMP CHECK, so community can understand the level of work, security and commitment. Avoid providing sensitive information.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for ARFC phase, that has been as well implemented in TEMP CHECK stage, to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments.

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

        "body": "Author: [@Michigan_Blockchain](https://governance.aave.com/u/michigan_blockchain) - Michigan Blockchain, [@Isha](https://governance.aave.com/u/isha) - Isha Varshney (Celo Foundation)\n\nDate: 2023-08-14\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check aims to provide general background information on the Celo blockchain and seeks the community’s input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Celo, an emerging [L2 on Ethereum 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109).\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs detailed in the Background section below, the Celo ecosystem offers a unique value proposition featuring real-world usage and ReFi. As Aave will be given a prominent role on Celo, this deployment offers Aave differentiated expansion and revenue opportunities.\n\n1. A deployment on Celo expands AAVE’s utility and user base to a unique population of Celo’s mobile-first community which has [grown significantly](https://dune.com/springzhang/celo-blockchain-overview) over the past few months led by key launches that have brought in returning real-world users in emerging markets.\n2. Aave will be heavily utilized for real-world DeFi and ReFi use cases, particularly in emerging markets given Celo’s growing presence in these regions led by protocols like GoodDollar and Grassroots Economics.\n3. **The Celo Foundation will allocated 0.5% of CELO circulating supply as an incentive for Aave users to support the adoption and bootstrap growth on Celo.** This deployment will bring new users to the Aave platform and reach more users from the Celo community. The Celo Foundation can also support Aave DAO in setting up a verified node for the Celo network (subject to technical requirements being met and voting by the community) for which Celo can provide a grant.\n4. The [Mento protocol](https://www.mento.org/) on Celo proposed returning 120M CELO to the Celo Community Fund, which the Celo community has expressed interest in placing in Aave to boost on-chain liquidity for CELO (pending a governance process). More details [here](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-reserve-returning-celo/5236). Additionally, they proposed a $10M CELO / wETH pool on Uniswap which is expected to pass through Celo governance.\n5. In the long-term, this Celo x AAVE deployment has the potential opportunity to expand into natural capital-backed assets such as tokenized carbon credit and other ReFi assets (conditional upon rigorous liquidity and credit assessments by Chaos Labs and others).\n\n## Background\n\nCelo is an open-source, mobile-first EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, on a mission to foster an inclusive financial system for everyone. With an ecosystem thriving on [9.4M addresses, around 1M daily transactions](https://celoscan.io/)[~500,000 monthly active wallets](https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/stats),[and over 234M transactions](https://celoscan.io/) since inception, Celo sets the stage for real-world applications from day one. Celo has been one of the fastest-growing blockchains over the past few months.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiba5l3pstp4vgvs5b5brdkg3omz6w5otp7gepzh5ycqdxrspbxv6m)\n\n**Source: Nansen**\n\n### **Key Features:**\n\n**Mobile Accessibility**: Utilizes a decentralized phone verification protocol and SNARK-based light clients such as Plumo 1 for mobile-friendly operations.\n\n**Flexible Assets**: Celo offers native stablecoins in the form of Mento stable assets (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL), which are eligible for transaction fees. CELO itself natively supports the ERC20 interface, eliminating the need for wrapped versions.\n\n**Regenerative Finance**: Committed to regenerative finance, Celo is carbon-negative, offsetting over eight times its carbon footprint. An upcoming proposal, the [Ultragreen Money](https://www.ultragreen.money/), looks to further push Celo’s green initiatives.\n\n**Real World Usage:** CELO TVL continues to grow and is at [193M CELO](https://defillama.com/chain/Celo?currency=CELO) showing continued locking of assets into Celo DeFi protocols. Additionally, Celo has been chosen by [Kickstarter](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/kickstarter-to-start-blockchain-based-crowdfunding-project-report/) for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over [214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)) and [Deutsche Telekom](https://blog.celo.org/celo-deutsche-telekoms-partnership-strengthens-with-the-global-launch-of-t-challenge-bd102f07b572) which will attract new users to the ecosystem.\n\nThe Celo ecosystem emphasizes real-world applications—real-world usage has been the core focus since day 1 of the blockchain. Several of the many solutions actively being used by people around the world on the Celo blockchain include the following:\n\n- UBI: GoodDollar has over [130,000 monthly beneficiaries 1](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/celo?period=month) around the world.\n- Community Currency: Grassroots Economics has [over 20,000 active users](https://viz.sarafu.network/) across Kenya and South Africa\n- Digital Microwork: The Celo Foundation initially piloted digital microwork with [Mercy Corps Ventures](https://www.mercycorps.org/research-resources/potential-cryptocurrency-kenya-youth) and today Jumptask has over [40,000 users](https://celoscan.io/token/0x1d18d0386f51ab03e7e84e71bda1681eba865f1f) on Celo\n- Climate action: [Plastiks](https://plastiks.io/) recently partnered with FC Barcelona on a [climate-focused NFT launch](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/3505122/fc-barcelona-launches-its-first-nft-collection-in-association-with-plastiks) and [Ecosapiens](https://www.ecosapiens.xyz/) debuted their new [enterprise climate collectible](https://nftnow.com/news/exclusive-ecosapiens-debuts-corporate-climate-collectibles-on-celo/) on Celo. [Toucan](https://toucan.earth/) protocol, [Carbonpath](https://www.carbonpath.io/), and [CarbonTerra](https://carbonterra.com/) offer on chain carbon credit retirements. Additionally, the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) continues to remain a leader in the industry driving web3 solutions for solving the climate crisis.\n- Real-world lending: [EthicHub](https://www.ethichub.com/en/) supports 21 smallholder farming communities in Mexico, Brazil, and Honduras for uncollateralized lending. The [Credit Collective](https://forum.celo.org/t/credit-collective-hello-world/5789) is currently seeding liquidity into new impact-driven lending and RWA protocols on Celo with members including [impactMarket 1](https://www.impactmarket.com/), [Flowcarbon](https://www.flowcarbon.com/), [Huma Finance 1](https://huma.finance/), and [Canza Finance](https://canza.io/).\n- Native mobile offramps: Through [FiatConnect 1](https://fiatconnect.org/), an API standard for web3 wallets to integrate with cash-in/cash-out providers, Celo users will be able to natively onramp and offramp through mobile wallets. In its initial activation, [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) wallet users across 20 countries can now leverage this technology.\n- Social impact and mobile gaming: The Celo Foundation partnered with [Animoca](https://www.animocabrands.com/animoca-brands-joins-celo-ecosystem-to-accelerate-web3-adoption) on mobile-first and social impact gaming. Engagements include Animoca serving as a validator and [climate education](https://twitter.com/TinyTapAB/status/1684485236200026112) with [TinyTap](https://www.start.tinytap.com/publisher-nft).\n\n**Integration with Ethereum**: cLabs recently [proposed 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109) that Celo return home to Ethereum by transitioning from an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2. Following months of research by the cLabs team as well as initial discussions among core Celo and Ethereum community members, the cLabs team detailed an architecture in which the Celo blockchain becomes an Ethereum L2, with key differentiators including\n\n- Decentralized sequencer powered by Celo’s existing validator set running Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus.\n- Off-chain data availability layer, powered by EigenLayer and EigenDA, operated by Ethereum node operators, and protected by restaked ETH. EigenDA brings the design of danksharding to Ethereum early, enabling Celo to maintain its low fees.\n- A design that retains Celo’s 1-block finality.\n\nThis proposal was [overwhelmingly approved](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/116) by the Celo ecosystem in a temperature check to continue this work.\n\n**Security**: The chain consensus is Proof of Stake with validators taking delegation. There is no multisignature contract that can change the network. On-chain governance proposals and hard-forks are the only ways to make changes to the network. The Smart Contract was audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/celo-contracts-audit/) and a Security Audit was conducted by [Trailofbits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PEjoN_wn--OWwzOcolAUGimBjqFjEecNSSQwL6i0y3Q/edit). There is also a formal verification of Celo governance protocols by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CeloMay2020.pdf).\n\n**Native Mobile Solutions**: [FiatConnect 1](https://fiatconnect.org/) allows Celo users to natively handle onramps and offramps through mobile wallets in multiple countries.\n\nEmphasizing global utility, Celo has been a touchstone for decentralized solutions worldwide. From UBI, community currencies, and digital microwork, to climate action, Celo propels web3 solutions with a real-world impact.\n\nFor a detailed dive, head over to https://docs.celo.org/.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nChaos Labs advised us on initial parameter recommendations, given the current liquidity levels on Celo. **Please note that these recommendations would be updated closer to launch.** We encourage other risk managers for updated analyses post temperature check. Crucially, the metrics below **do not** include a [governance proposal 1](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/121) in which $10M of liquidity is proposed by the Celo ecosystem for a CELO / wETH pool on Uniswap.\n\nBased on current liquidity levels, **we believe a Metis-type of initial deployment would be most suitable—the emphasis here being the Celo blockchain’s real-world and social impact use cases**. Over time, we expect we can continue to increase caps as the Celo blockchain grows through the development of more real-world use cases and the transition to an L2 on Ethereum.\n\n| Risk Parameters | WETH | USDC | CELO | cUSD |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | YES |\n| Enable Borrow | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | NO | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 75% | N/A | 70% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 80% | N/A | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% | 5% | N/A | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% | 15% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | 110 | 880,000 | 60,000 | 3,400,000 |\n| Supply Cap | 140 | 1,100,000 | 80,000 | 4,300,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | TBD |\n| uOptimal | 80% | 80% | 45% | 75% |\n| Base | 1% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 3.8% | 4% | 7% | 7% |\n| Slope2 | 80% | 60% | 300% | 75% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Stable Slope1 | 13.00% | 13.00% | 13.00% | 13.00% |\n| Stable Slope2 | 300.00% | 300.00% | 300.00% | 300.00% |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset | 3.00% | 3.00% | 3.00% | 3.00% |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00% | 5.00% | 5.00% | 5.00% |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00% | 20.00% | 20.00% | 20.00% |\n| Flashloanable | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Siloed Borrowing | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | NO | YES | NO | NO |\n\n**Oracle:** Chainlink recently deployed on Celo as part of the Chainlink SCALE Program.\n\n**Cross-chain Interactions**: Celo has integrations with token bridges like [Portal (Wormhole)](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer), [Allbridge](https://allbridge.io/classic/), and [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/)–along with cross-chain messaging partners including [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/), [Hyperlane](https://www.hyperlane.xyz/), [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/), and [Axelar](https://axelar.network/).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided above about Celo is from public sources and Michigan Blockchain cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.\n\nThe Celo Foundation has been collaborating with Michigan Blockchain to work through the details of this proposed deployment and communicate the merits to the broader Aave community.
