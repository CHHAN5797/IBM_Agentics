This pool has suffered severe losses and, as of today, Balancer is practically its sole LP, with ~$32k worth in its position. Currently, the pool sees little to no action and Prime DAO only has incentives to LM on [D2D/USDC (Ethereum)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x27c9f71cc31464b906e0006d4fcbc8900f48f15f00020000000000000000010f) and [D2D/rETH (Arbitrum)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x835772bab114563746da80806930a9e37aa853440002000000000000000004c0).\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal seeks to unstake and withdraw proportionally (50/50) from the position, keeping both the D2D and BAL tokens back in the Treasury.\n\nIt’s our expectation that BAL with grow in value somewhat still correlated to ETH, and D2D might not see the same upside, therefore taking even more IL in this position. This way, we can save whatever BAL we have left (~4k at the time of writing).\n\nThere’s not enough liquidity on-chain to sell D2D and we are not looking to kill our partnership, so other strategies for using the D2D may be presented to governance as appropriate.\n\nNoting that these assets were not under Karpartkey's management.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe DAO multisig on Ethereum 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f interact with the D2D-BAL BPT token contract at `0x8f4205e1604133d1875a3E771AE7e4F2b0865639` and call `transfer` with arguments\n`recipient` as the Maxis LM multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` and\n`amount` as `136955000000000000000000` representing the LP tokens currently held by the DAO multi-sig\nAfter the funds have been transfered to the Maxi LM multi-sig, it will execute a withdrawal and transfer of funds to the Balancer DAO multi-sig concluding the transaction.\n\nPool:  [D2D/BAL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x8f4205e1604133d1875a3e771ae7e4f2b086563900020000000000000000010e)\nBPT Token holdings reference: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8f4205e1604133d1875a3e771ae7e4f2b0865639?a=0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f",

Balancer DAO has a large sum of BAL tokens idle in the treasury, and one of the best possible ways to benefit ourselves and the greater ecosystem would to have BAL available to borrow on Aave. The treasury would earn returns on the deposit, and anyone interested in borrowing BAL would have access. \n\nAt the time of writing 188.34k out of 350k total BAL is deposited in the Aave v3 [module](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3). I propose we deposit 160k, nearly the total remaining supply possible. As time goes on we can increase or decrease this strategy depending on market conditions. \n\nSpecification:\n\nThe DAO Multisig on mainnet `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the BAL token address `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing the `approve` function with spender(address) as Aave v3's proxy `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2` and amount as `160000000000000000000000`. \n\nThen the DAO Multisig will then interact with Aave's contract `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2` by writing the `supply` function with the following arguements: \n- asset: `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` \n- amount: `160000000000000000000000`\n- onBehalfOf: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`\n- referralCode: `0`",

This deposit qualifies the Balancer DAO for these additional benefits, as it satisfies the requirement of having \"GNO in locking contracts on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.\" The current proposal aims to claim 119,196.473 Safe tokens, receiving them in the  [Balancer DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f).\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThe DAO Multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ```0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f``` will interact with the SAFE contract at ```0x20cF5bA8aBA68Cd7Ca3d0cAfAc54dA807c772418``` and write the claim function for the total amount allocated, passing \n  \n```\"0xe3f30724dc7b68f4dc7bef54b812e18454d9b9b278887f4f09de5ee8dd2fbb97\"```                                        ,                                                                                      ```\"0x403b039b300b5d3f14f5a95011807ad1f279c31b5c6668e9dad1cbd43d5d9271\"```                                         ,                                                 ```\"0x25ddc11367cfc9aeab1086adcc396ffdaeb90e491021ab488fcacd43037cd4e6\"```                                        ,                                                                                                  ```\"0xc2628e8800f0dbbce626dcf83c09a30a5a97d79413dcb79ca32a75d3cc1e66b8\"```                                        ,\n```\"0x933f0c6611414cc50cc739051a4e8140ca04f4ca6113746cedf8e9174aa9a6df\"]```\n\nfor the ```merkleProof``` argument, and ```119196472786989781864064``` for the ```amountAllocated``` argument.",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/916\n\nOverview\n\nOriginally when BeethovenX was approved as a friendly fork 10 million BEETS was set aside for the DAO to unlock via a vest. This can be seen here in the original vote. https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc to receive 4% of the total supply, 250M tokens, which can be confirmed in BEETS [tokenomics](https://docs.beets.fi/beets/tokenomics). The purpose of this proposal is to update the fantom wallet responsible for this vesting contract with the maxis as signers. The maxis will then claim the fully vested balance of BEETS, and transfer it to the DAO Multisig on Optimism. This is to make the bridging process streamlined. For the time being this will consolidate the multisigs utilized by the DAO as fantom is a relatively inactive network. There is no plan to utilize the BEETS tokens in any way for the time being, but an additional proposal can be made to do so at a later time.\n\nThe current DAO Multisig on Fantom will not be utilized after these actions unless absolutely necessary after this proposal. The likelihood of it's use is incredibly low due to the networks activity, and Balancer's influence in the Fantom ecosystem.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe DAO Multisig ftm: `0xFe2022da08d17ac8388F5bEFE4F71456255105A4` will call `addOwnerWithThreshold` on itself six times, with the `threshold` equal to `6` and the following new `owner` addresses:\n\n`0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17`\n`0xafFC70b81D54F229A5F50ec07e2c76D2AAAD07Ae`\n`0xc4591c41e01a7a654B5427f39Bbd1dEe5bD45D1D`\n`0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516`\n`0x11761c7b08287d9489CD84C04DF6852F5C07107b`\n`0xcf4fF1e03830D692F52EB094c52A5A6A2181Ab3F`\n\nThese can be confirmed via [bal_addresses](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/4396ca6ee46272111bb6db65e5054af079e58dda/extras/signers.json#L2)\n\nThe DAO Multisig ftm: `0xFe2022da08d17ac8388F5bEFE4F71456255105A4` will then interact with the vesting contract `0x8D381EC09356C3F1805c54B2BB0867e8b417DC3a` calling `release` with the BEETS token address `0xF24Bcf4d1e507740041C9cFd2DddB29585aDCe1e` as the `token` argument. \n\nOnce the BEETS is received it will sent to the Maxi Multisig until further notice by calling `transfer` on `ftm:0xF24Bcf4d1e507740041C9cFd2DddB29585aDCe1e` with the recipient as `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e` and amount `10000000000000000000000000`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/514\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nDue to a recent issue with the USD+ and DAI+ linear pool’s deployed by Overnight Finance on Arbitrum, the Maxis are proposing to refund affected user’s 15,158 USDC. The root cause of the issue is both linear pools being deployed with the swap fee of 6% as opposed to 0.06%. Overnight has returned 7527 USDC equivalent to the DAO, from this [txn](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x99361a3a5568114ed2c72d82bba12cd7e45a0bd58bdb1ec8b4372ab0958efa5f) on Arbitrum, and the [BIP-420](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-420-refund-voting-incentives-for-pools-shut-down-due-to-bug-report/5159). The remaining 7631 USDC will come from the DAO Treasury.\n\n**Summary**: \n\nThe way the fee works on linear pools, means every time the balances were out of the set targets, a fee would be awarded to arbitrageurs for pushing the balances back between the bounds. Rebalancing the pool per normal operations would usually be handled by the Maxis in order to wrap assets, but was not possible due to Overnight’s fee on wrapping. This is the only instance of a linear pool like this and was out of the norm. In the Optimism deployments, Overnight has a rebalancing bot set to maintain the custom circumstances and keep the pool within desired targets for users, but in this case it was not deployed until after the fact.\n\nThe Balancer Labs Data team was able to put together this [dune dashboard](https://dune.com/queries/2990731) to quantify the individual losses by wallet. Ultimately the Maxis feel the users should be fully compensated for the fees suffered due to the error. This is why I am proposing that the DAO covers the remaining amount. All funds will be airdropped to users who are listed on the dashboard if their owed amount is over 1 USDC.\n\nSpecification:\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` as recipient and amount as 7631 USDC `7631000000`.\n\nThe Maxi LM Multisig will bridge the 2500 USDC it already received, and 7631 USDC from above for a total of 10131 USDC to Arbitrum. The LM Multisig will execute this using WalletConnect via Gnosis Safe.\n\nOnce the bridge transaction is claimed by the LM Multisig on Arbitrum, the Multisig will deploy an airdrop to the addresses listed on the dune dashboard above, and their corresponding amounts.",
