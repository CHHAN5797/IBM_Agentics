        "body": "## Simple Summary\nA proposal to adjust eight ( 8) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for four (4) assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Abstract\nFollowing recent market events, the AAVE community has decided to reduce the risk profile across many higher volatile assets by disabling borrow or freezing across v2 markets ([AIP-121](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/121/), [AIP-124](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/124/), and [AIP-125](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/125/))\n\nAfter mitigating the immediate risk to the protocol with the above AIPs, Chaos Labs is exploring the impact and trade-offs of decreasing the Liquidation Thresholds and LTVs of long-tail assets on Ethereum v2 (ENS, MKR, SNX, and CRV).\n\nThis proposal is the second in a [series of proposals](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897) intended to reduce the viability of different attack vectors on v2 assets.\n\n## Motivation\nCapital efficiency reductions on v2 assets will further mitigate attack vectors, in part by increasing the capital required to wage a price manipulation attack on Aave. In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to v3, where users can enjoy the benefits of E-mode with enhanced risk techniques and mitigation methodologies.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments 7 days before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, Nansen Connect, and Blockscan Chat).\n\nIn the graphs below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users for community discussion.\n\nMainnet snapshot captured on December 4th, 2022, 16:30 GMT\n## CRV\n \n![Untitled (4) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiftomsg4ucgq7agu6zjw7pfwwhg2u5nmeey2vwtste3qa4y376wkm)\n    \n## MKR\n \n![Untitled (5) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreietyanzm7dze2asldgw7w52cqjjkdstwwtuyv426ffuyr6wucxkti)\n    \n## SNX\n \n![Untitled (6) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreie55jwuybptqvjghrxctp6bymjl4oavkfvtkdsy42ah4iypdnpg6q)\n    \n## ENS\n- Zero (0) liquidations for up to an 8% reduction.\n## Joint Reduction of $MKR, $CRV, $SNX and $ENS\n- Reducing LTs jointly for the above long tail assets by 3% results in less than 6K USD worth of liquidations\n \n![Untitled (7) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiczlhq32rrj7fjbs66gv4v52twb7ghezkp4em6pg5k5oy6ge3fl54)\n## Joint Reductions with $USDC and $DAI\n- The assets can also be reduced jointly with the suggested [USDC, DAI change](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897) without causing additional liquidations.\n\n## Recommendation\n \n![Screen Shot 2022-12-05 at 2.13.57 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreif72fcajvopiooewsizhljqusudsa7rzu6tdxq6oryef6tjeezloq)",

Reducing capital efficiency on v2 assets will mitigate attack vectors while also serving as effective motivation to shift usage to v3, where users can enjoy the benefits of E-mode with enhanced risk techniques and mitigation methodologies.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to make the full implications clear to the community at each step. To best minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by a series of incremental decreases, following the Risk-Off Framework 2 previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP. In an attempt to avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments 7 days before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, Nansen Connect, and Blockscan Chat 1).\n\n## Motivation\nThe priority of this proposal is not to optimize markets (capital efficiency); but rather to focus on the security and risk mitigation of the protocol. It will be followed up with additional proposals to update risk parameters to reflect the current market conditions accurately.\n\nThe goal of this ARC is two-fold:\n\nReduce LTs → Reducing liquidation thresholds for DAI  effectively reduces capital efficiency and increases the required capital for waging price manipulation attacks on Aave.\nEncourage user migrations to v3 → This also begins to pave the way towards migrating to v3, where these assets can be utilized in E-mode.\nHowever, this is a significant change, and we wanted to present data to quantify and visualize the effect of such reductions on protocol users for community discussion. Specifically, we want to surface data around the liquidations this would trigger, as some are sizable and warrant a discussion of how these should be handled and if this is the most appropriate action forward.\n\n## DAI LT Reduction Implications:\nMainnet snapshot captured on December 6th, 20:00 GMT\n \n \n![Screen Shot 2022-12-06 at 5.59.16 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiccmsm5me4bjxk72h2wtjebalm2ayx77gkc4hlhg2hdtnqzmthl7e)\n    \n    \n## Summary\nBased on prior community discourse and market activity over the past few weeks, Aave should continue reviewing avenues to derisk all v2 markets with a specific eye on LTs & LTVs.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\nA proposal to adjust four (4) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across two (2) Aave V3 Avalanche assets.\n\n## Motivation\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different configurations of Aave V3 risk parameters would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt.\n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the search range to ±3% change for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters in cases the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\n#### Increase LTs + LTVs (WAVAX and LINK.e)\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WAVAX and LINK.e, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a minor effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n## Recommendations:\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recomm. | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WAVAX | Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WAVAX | Loan-to-Value | 65% | 68% | +3% |\n| LINK.e | Liquidation Threshold | 65% | 68% | +3% |\n| LINK.e | Loan-to-Value | 50% | 53% | +3% |",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across one (1) Aave V2 asset. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of recommendations follows [AIP 117](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=117) to further de-risk the REN market. \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ktXGW6P.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zoCKkVn.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xO974Ct.png)\n\n**Price changes of key assets since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9D7yUOW.png)\n\n**Time series of Value at Risk (VaR) since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R8enrDr.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and percentage of total REN supplies:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m3qrkWx.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and borrow usages:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CNBpVd8.png)\n\n**Entire supply positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rMEczds.png)\n\n**Entire borrow positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HEKWdu8.png)\n\n\nBelow, Gauntlet analyzes the user which contributes the most Value at Risk per our simulations.\n\nUser: `0x364d5077c4c6bce6280705fe657fc4c55fdac363`\n\n**User supply breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QZW65gh.png)\n\n**Relevant collateral factors**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nOdid9p.png)\n\n**User borrowing power breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xsPK0i7.png)\n\n**User borrows breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1Tz7Anr.png)\n\n**User borrow usage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Tnwhl0a.png)\n\nNote that this user has been elastic as of late, updating their token positions often.\n\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\nThese parameter recommendations reflect the unique situation of REN in the current market conditions.  \n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **REN Liquidation Threshold**     | 65%     | ***60%***     |\n| **REN Loan To Value**     | 60%     | ***55%***     |\n\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 11/16/2022, the data shows that only one dust account, `0x0e1337ea2c604f9a937d2623af206cdd02167b38` would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This account has a total of ~$100 in supply.\n\nThis could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-11-21\n\n## Quick Links\n[Analytics Dashboard](https://metabase.gauntlet.network/public/dashboard/f4930651-29be-4ff3-b664-a34462e286c5)\n[Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave)\n[Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc)\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) \n\nGauntlet launched an insolvency refund for Aave that contains a portion of our payment stream that can be clawed back in the event of insolvencies due to market risk. Since our last recommendation there have been no new insolvencies in Aave. Gauntlet’s Insolvency Refund vault is still live and can be seen here [0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

    "ai_final_reason": "- The timeline voting data shows unanimous early and stable support for the 'YAE' option, indicating strong consensus among voters.\n- The proposal aligns with the previously approved risk-off framework aimed at reducing attack vectors on Aave V2 assets.\n- Forum sentiment is somewhat negative but limited, and does not strongly oppose the vote outcome; the recommendation mirrors the aggregated voter sentiment.\n- Adjacent similar proposal passed unanimously but had negative post-vote market impacts, which advises caution but does not outweigh the benefits of risk mitigation and protocol security.\n- Market metrics during the event window show a slight negative price impact but a positive TVL impact, supporting protocol health.\n- Overall, the recommendation to change risk parameters maximizes long-term organizational durability despite mixed forum sentiment.",
