Depositors can choose lock durations to earn higher returns, enabling automated maturity laddering of reserves and reducing duration mismatch risks—challenges inherent in traditional banking.\n\nKey features of iUSD include:\n\n- **Fractional Reserve Design**: Achieves higher yield across depositor segments by combining liquid and locked capital into duration-matched strategies.\n- **Depositor-Driven Allocation**: Users determine how their funds are deployed, based on preferred liquidity timelines.\n- **Yield Optimization**: Liquid deposits earn top DeFi rates, while locked positions gain amplified returns.\n- **Blockchain Transparency**: Fully on-chain and governed by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and trustlessness.\n\naGHO, on the other side of the pair, represents GHO deposited into Aave’s yield-bearing Prime instance. It combines the stability and overcollateralization of GHO with passive native yield from Aave.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntroducing a gauge for the iUSD/aGHO Composable Stable pool enhances liquidity and accessibility between two distinct yet complementary stablecoins:\n\n- **Yield Synergy**:  aGHO is yield-bearing by design while iUSD is the vanilla stablecoin of infinifi ecosystem, it earns points rather than being yield bearing. This pool offers users a yield-maximized stable pair, ideal for liquidity providers and DAOs seeking low-risk yield.\n- **Deepens iUSD Utility**: Adding GHO as a trading pair on Balancer offers DeFi-native arbitrage and integration potential.\n- **Supports iUSD Distribution**: Balancer’s infrastructure offers a trusted, programmable venue to introduce iUSD to more DeFi participants.\n- **Composable Collateral**: A deep and efficient pool can support integrations with leverage protocols, yield vaults, and synthetic markets.\n\nA gauge will accelerate TVL growth and market usage, establishing this pool as the primary DeFi liquidity venue for iUSD.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\ninfiniFi is governed by smart contracts with a future pathway toward DAO-managed control over key parameters and reserve deployment logic. Depositors drive asset allocation through bonding preferences, creating transparent and market-driven governance outcomes.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\niUSD leverages on-chain DeFi markets such as Aave and Compound for asset yields. Pricing for redemptions and collateral values is computed via verifiable on-chain mechanisms. The system currently does not rely on off-chain oracles but may integrate oracle feeds (e.g., Chainlink) for advanced features.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nLink to the audits [here](https://docs.infinifi.xyz/Security-1fb44c414f3680d6b5ccfccefdf2c5cb)\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\ninfiniFi is non-custodial and fully on-chain. All deposits, locks, and allocations are governed by smart contracts. There is no reliance on centralized intermediaries or off-chain execution, minimizing centralization risks.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nThis is a new Balancer v3 pool launching to support the growth of iUSD and aGHO liquidity. iUSD is actively used within the infiniFi protocol, and this Balancer integration represents the first major external liquidity venue for the asset. aGHO is already in use within Aave and Balancer GHO initiatives.\n\n- [Balancer Pool Link](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) (To be added upon deployment)\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThis pool will serve as the primary DeFi liquidity hub for iUSD while enhancing GHO ecosystem stability and utility. The pairing supports passive yield strategies, arbitrage, and future integrations across lending protocols and structured product layers.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: `0x733F2D3f66d3F41bde65d95321A19a1e55BB5470` \n- Gauge(address): `0xac681deb529b49b5a563fbf0dcccb95d5bb7cdb0` \n- GaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

The sUSDe/USDC pool is 50% yield bearing and will be a core pool.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\n* Website: [Ethena.fi](https://www.ethena.fi/)\n* Documentation: [Ethena documentation](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/)\n* Twitter: [Twitter links](https://twitter.com/ethena_labs/status/1759546702187696437?s=20)\n* [Fundraising news](https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1759546368467849577?s=20)\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nEthena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the ‘Internet Bond’.\n\nEthena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.\n\nUSDe peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral.\n\nsUSDe is the staked version of USDe which earns yield from the protocol.\n\nUSDe has already seen extensive use throughout DeFi, making this an interesting asset to onboard to Balancer.\n\nFor example, liquidity on Curve is already over >100m:\n\n* [https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena ](https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena)\n* [https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank ](https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank)\n* [https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde ](https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde)\n\nUSDe is currently the 4th highest volume asset in the whole of Ethereum behind ETH, USDC, USDT: [Uniswap Interface ](https://app.uniswap.org/explore)\n\n## Motivation:\n\nBalancer is seeking to establish the sUSDe/USDC as a main liquidity source for users wishing to swap sUSDe to USDC and avoid the 7-day delay for unstaking. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Ethena community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nUSDe derives its peg stability from executing automated and programmatic delta-neutral hedges with respect to the underlying collateral assets.\n\nHedging the price change risk of the collateral asset in the same size ensures the change in value of the collateral asset is offset by the change in value of the hedging leg.\n\nThis ensures the synthetic USD value of the collateral remains relatively stable in all market conditions.\n\nConsidering the recent launch of sUSDe and current scaling plans, further proposals will suggest conservative LTVs and borrow caps in order to thoughtfully scale sUSDe as collateral.\n\n## Key Information\n\n* Users are able to acquire USDe in permissionless external liquidity pools.\n* Approved parties from permitted jurisdictions who pass KYC/KYB screening are able to mint & redeem USDe on-demand with Ethena Labs contracts directly which will include only market making entities.\n* There is no reliance upon traditional banking infrastructure as trustless collateral is held and stored within the crypto-system. USDe is fully backed by users’ deposits at all times.\n* Users are also able to complete Cross Market Arbitrage by minting & redeeming USDe with Ethena and trading USDe in external markets such as Binance or Curve pools to capture price dislocations.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe protocol is exposed to various risks including but not limited to:\n\n* Smart Contract Risk\n* External Platform Risk\n* Liquidity Risk\n* Custodial Operational Risk\n* Exchange Counterparty Risk\n* Market Risk\n\n## Governance:\n\nEthena currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to shards holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n## Oracles:\n\nThe Ethena system is split between onchain and offchain components. It does not use any onchain oracles at the moment as all pricing is external to onchain price fees with centralized perpetual markets, but we do use extensive offchain data sources from multiple providers.\n\nEthena Labs relies on price feeds in order to price the mint and redeem USDe requests per the available derivatives market liquidity as well as manage the risk of our derivatives positions. Real-time data feeds indicate not only where it delegates collateral, but the various risk profiles between the exchanges.\n\nWith this in mind, it's critically important that Ethena has access to & is constantly consuming real-time price feeds, especially from where it matters most; the exchanges where it holds derivatives positions due to their margin requirements.\n\nEthena consumes real-time pricing information from three primary sources:\n\n* CeFi Exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Okx, Deribit, Bitmex and Bitget.\n* Pyth.\n* Redstone\n\nThis real-time data is used extensively throughout the system to apply business logic, but to also ensure the integrity of all actions.\n\n## Audits:\n\nEthena has undertaken a multi-phased audit program to ensure the highest level of security on the procotol.\n\n* Phase 1: conducted initial audit with Zellic on the v1 of the protocol where no critical or high level vulnerabilities were found.\n* Phase 2: architecture design review and economic risk factor analysis with Spearbit's Kurt Barry former Lead Engineer at MakerDAO\n* Phase 3: phased audit with industry leading firms:\n  * Quantstamp\n  * Spearbit & Cantina\n* Phase 4: independent audit with Pashov with individual experience of over 50 audits\n* Phase 5: public audit with Code4rena\n* Phase 6: economic and financial risk audit by Chaos Labs\n* Phase 7: upcoming public bug bounty program with Immunefi\n\nCopies of the audit reports can be found [here](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/resources/audits).\n\n## Centralization vectors:\n\nSee [here](https://ethena.notion.site/Ethena-FAQs-3ccc1437e13343f8b74c0d005e4f5128)\n\nValue: The sUSDe/USDC pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for users wishing to avoid the 7-day unstaking period and instead swap sUSDe direct for USDC.\n\nsUSDe on mainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9d39a5de30e57443bff2a8307a4256c8797a3497\n\nUSDC on mainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\n\nsUSDe/USDC pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xb819feef8f0fcdc268afe14162983a69f6bf179e000000000000000000000689\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC#code)\n\n## Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC\n\ngaugeType(string): Ethereum",

The sUDEe/USDC pool is 50% yield bearing and will be a core pool.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\n* Website: [Ethena.fi](https://www.ethena.fi/)\n* Documentation: [Ethena documentation](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/)\n* Twitter: [Twitter links](https://twitter.com/ethena_labs/status/1759546702187696437?s=20)\n* [Fundraising news](https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1759546368467849577?s=20)\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nEthena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the ‘Internet Bond’.\n\nEthena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.\n\nUSDe peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral.\n\nsUSDe is the staked version of USDe which earns yield from the protocol.\n\nUSDe has already seen extensive use throughout DeFi, making this an interesting asset to onboard to Balancer.\n\nFor example, liquidity on Curve is already over >100m:\n\n* [https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena ](https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena)\n* [https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank ](https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank)\n* [https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde ](https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde)\n\nUSDe is currently the 4th highest volume asset in the whole of Ethereum behind ETH, USDC, USDT: [Uniswap Interface ](https://app.uniswap.org/explore)\n\n## Motivation:\n\nEthena is seeking to establish the sUSDe/USDC and USDe/USDC pools on Arbitrum as its main liquidity sources to further enrich liquidity for sUSDe and USDe. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Ethena community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nUSDe derives its peg stability from executing automated and programmatic delta-neutral hedges with respect to the underlying collateral assets.\n\nHedging the price change risk of the collateral asset in the same size ensures the change in value of the collateral asset is offset by the change in value of the hedging leg.\n\nThis ensures the synthetic USD value of the collateral remains relatively stable in all market conditions.\n\nConsidering the recent launch of sUSDe and current scaling plans, further proposals will suggest conservative LTVs and borrow caps in order to thoughtfully scale sUSDe as collateral.\n\n## Key Information\n\n* Users are able to acquire USDe in permissionless external liquidity pools.\n* Approved parties from permitted jurisdictions who pass KYC/KYB screening are able to mint & redeem USDe on-demand with Ethena Labs contracts directly which will include only market making entities.\n* There is no reliance upon traditional banking infrastructure as trustless collateral is held and stored within the crypto-system. USDe is fully backed by users’ deposits at all times.\n* Users are also able to complete Cross Market Arbitrage by minting & redeeming USDe with Ethena and trading USDe in external markets such as Binance or Curve pools to capture price dislocations.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe protocol is exposed to various risks including but not limited to:\n\n* Smart Contract Risk\n* External Platform Risk\n* Liquidity Risk\n* Custodial Operational Risk\n* Exchange Counterparty Risk\n* Market Risk\n\n## Governance:\n\nEthena currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to shards holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n## Oracles:\n\nThe Ethena system is split between onchain and offchain components. It does not use any onchain oracles at the moment as all pricing is external to onchain price fees with centralized perpetual markets, but we do use extensive offchain data sources from multiple providers.\n\nEthena Labs relies on price feeds in order to price the mint and redeem USDe requests per the available derivatives market liquidity as well as manage the risk of our derivatives positions. Real-time data feeds indicate not only where it delegates collateral, but the various risk profiles between the exchanges.\n\nWith this in mind, it's critically important that Ethena has access to & is constantly consuming real-time price feeds, especially from where it matters most; the exchanges where it holds derivatives positions due to their margin requirements.\n\nEthena consumes real-time pricing information from three primary sources:\n\n* CeFi Exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Okx, Deribit, Bitmex and Bitget.\n* Pyth.\n* Redstone\n\nThis real-time data is used extensively throughout the system to apply business logic, but to also ensure the integrity of all actions.\n\n## Audits:\n\nEthena has undertaken a multi-phased audit program to ensure the highest level of security on the procotol.\n\n* Phase 1: conducted initial audit with Zellic on the v1 of the protocol where no critical or high level vulnerabilities were found.\n* Phase 2: architecture design review and economic risk factor analysis with Spearbit's Kurt Barry former Lead Engineer at MakerDAO\n* Phase 3: phased audit with industry leading firms:\n  * Quantstamp\n  * Spearbit & Cantina\n* Phase 4: independent audit with Pashov with individual experience of over 50 audits\n* Phase 5: public audit with Code4rena\n* Phase 6: economic and financial risk audit by Chaos Labs\n* Phase 7: upcoming public bug bounty program with Immunefi\n\nCopies of the audit reports can be found [here](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/resources/audits).\n\n## Centralization vectors:\n\nSee [here](https://ethena.notion.site/Ethena-FAQs-3ccc1437e13343f8b74c0d005e4f5128)\n\n## Value: \n\nThe sUSDe/USDC and USDe/USDC pools on Balancer are intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the tokens on Arbitrum.\n\n## Specifications\nsUSDe on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x211cc4dd073734da055fbf44a2b4667d5e5fe5d2\n\nUSDe on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5d3a1ff2b6bab83b63cd9ad0787074081a52ef34\n\nsUSDe/USDC Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x2f0cdf8596be980ef24924ca7bf54e630ca526b2000000000000000000000529\n\nChild chain gauge [0xE9801a0FA08acF9140bA3a347A8c6048fF9Eab7C](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xE9801a0FA08acF9140bA3a347A8c6048fF9Eab7C)\nMainnet root: [0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778)\n\nUSDe/USDC Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x537d8ef9e6e0adfb099cb14aeaf04ebeffaf444c000000000000000000000528\n\nChild chain gauge: [0xc76bCF2221a1Be984FeA73E12429302AfC70feb2](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc76bCF2221a1Be984FeA73E12429302AfC70feb2#readContract)\nMainnet root: [0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c)\n\nsUSDe/USDe Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x02a1e9f29e9a04dbb64114e78cb6cba20c22d73f00000000000000000000052a\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x64B57375a5DD480280cc0513B20e380f1649545c](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x64B57375a5DD480280cc0513B20e380f1649545c)\nMainnet root: [0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493)\n\nsUSDe/sFRAX Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x59743f1812bb85db83e9e4ee061d124aaa64290000000000000000000000052b\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x4b8858a8E42f406B4dC2eCB8D48B5cf0021035c8](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4b8858a8E42f406B4dC2eCB8D48B5cf0021035c8)\nMainnet root: [0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE)\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2049\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the new **USDN/aGHO** Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Ethereum.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [SmarDex Website](https://smardex.io/)\n- [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral)\n- [SmarDex GitHub](https://github.com/SmarDex-Ecosystem)\n- [SmarDex Twitter](https://twitter.com/SmarDex)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nSmarDex introduces **USDN**, a fully decentralized synthetic dollar designed to maintain a stable value around $1 while providing yield to its holders. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by centralized reserves, USDN employs a delta-neutral strategy through a structured product mechanism. This approach balances long and short positions within the protocol to stabilize USDN's value and generate returns for participants.\n\nKey features of USDN include:\n\n- **Decentralization**: Operates entirely on-chain without reliance on centralized entities.\n- **Yield Generation**: Utilizes a rebase mechanism to distribute yields directly to holders' wallets.\n- **Delta-Neutral Strategy**: Maintains stability by balancing leveraged long positions against the vault's holdings.\n- **No Custodial Risk**: Users interact directly with smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntegrating USDN with aGHO in a Balancer v3 Composable Stable pool offers several advantages:\n\n- **Enhanced Capital Efficiency**: aGHO, being GHO deposited into Aave's Prime instance, accrues native yield, reducing the need for additional incentives.\n- **Strengthened Liquidity**: Establishes a primary liquidity venue for USDN, promoting seamless integrations with DeFi protocols utilizing aGHO.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader integrations across DeFi for USDN.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nSmarDex uses \"Privileged functions\" which allow Multisigs to have an overview about all important functions of the protocol. \n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nThe USDN protocol relies on a dual-oracle system, utilizing both Pyth and Chainlink, to obtain accurate price feeds. This redundancy ensures resilience against potential oracle failures and maintains the integrity of the protocol's operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nSmarDex's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral/risks).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nThere is no governance; the team manages all operations. Some contracts are renounced, while others are controlled by a 3/5 multisig\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nAs a new Balancer v3 pool, the USDN/aGHO pair aims to establish itself as a significant liquidity venue for USDN. The integration with Aave's aGHO token is expected to enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **USDN/aGHO** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for USDN, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize GHO. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and expanding USDN's utility across the Ethereum ecosystem. With GHO being the cornerstone asset for swap in Balancer v3 it will ensure efficient swap throughout the DEX.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: 0x950682e741abd1498347a93b942463af4ec7132b\n- Gauge: 0x9798995a042973d9705a4f0fea691a4541d13b43\n- GaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Currently, the Aave Protocol has a TVL of approximately $10.7 Billion.\n>\n>GHO is a decentralized multi-collateral stable coin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol.\n>\n>**USDC**\nUSDC is a digital dollar, also known as a stablecoin, that’s available 24/7 and moves at internet speed. USDC lives natively on the internet, running on many of the world’s most advanced blockchains. Billions of USDC change hands every day1, and every digital dollar of USDC is always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. - [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)\n>\n>**GYD**\n> GYD is an all-weather stablecoin that provides one-stop access to stablecoin risk control. GYD is fully backed by a set of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level to automate diversification and redundancy.\n>\n>These innovations include automated risk diversification rules, optimized minting and redemption design that guides the protocol on how to use reserve assets to maintain stability, and multiple layers of redundancy in price feeds and circuit breakers.[-Gyroscope](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-491-enable-3-gyd-stablecoin-gauges-ethereum/5357)\n>\n>**USDT**\n>\n>All Tether tokens (USD₮) are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves.[- Tether](https://tether.to/en/)\n>\n>**USDe & Ethena**\n>\n>Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the ‘Internet Bond’.\n>\n>Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.\n>\n>USDe peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral.\n>\n>## Motivation\n>\n>This proposal aims to add four veBAL gauges:\n>\n>**New Gauges**\n>\n>GHO/USDe Pool - Range: -50bps to 50bps\n>GHO/aArbUSDC Pool - Range: -40bps to 2bps\n>GHO/GYD Pool - Range: -40bps to 2bps\n>GHO/USDC/USDT Pool - Composable Stable Amp 750\n>\n>## Specification\n>\n>1. **Governance:** \n>\n>* AAVE, aAAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO. Holders can vote on proposals at both a Snapshot level and through the Aave DAO [on-chain governance portal](https://app.aave.com/governance/).\n> \n>* Ethena currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to shards holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n>\n>* The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n>\n>2. **Oracles:**\n>\n>* rateProvider0 (for GHO): 0x0 (none)\n>* rateProvider1 (for aArbUSDC): \n>* rateProvider0 (for GYD): 0x0 (none)\n>* rateProvider0 (for USDe): 0x0 (none)\n>* rateProvider0 (for USDC): 0x0 (none)\n>* rateProvider0 (for USDT): 0x0 (none)\n>\n>3. **Audits:**\n>\n>*Aave v3*\n>\n>* [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin ](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [Peckshield](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [SigmaPrime](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3.pdf)\n>\n>*GHO*\n>\n>* [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/02-06-2023_SigmaPrime.pdf)\n>* [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/07-03-2023_SigmaPrime.pdf)\n>* [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/01-03-2023_ABDK.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin-v2](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/10-11-2022_Openzeppelin-v2.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin-v1](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/12-08-2022_Openzeppelin-v1.pdf)\n>\n>*GYD*\n>\n>Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports).
