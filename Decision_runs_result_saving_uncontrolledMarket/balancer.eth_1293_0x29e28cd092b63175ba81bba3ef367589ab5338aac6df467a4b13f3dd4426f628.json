        "body": "**Summary:**\n\nXave Finance (pronounced “Save Finance”) aims to enable financial services companies (such as “fintechs” and neobanks) to leverage DeFi for actual use cases, such as real time remittance transfers and high yield consumer savings. Xave does this by building an FX accurate AMM via a custom “FXPool” now and eventually a stablecoin lending market that shares liquidity with the Balancer V2 Vault via a BoostedFXPool.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\nPasting links in reply due to new user limit\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nXave has deployed its first custom pool - the FXPool - that brings FX accurate stablecoin exchange to the Balancer DAO. The first FXPool deployed is an xSGD:USDC pool.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nStraitsX, the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoins xSGD and xIDR, will be helping to build use cases for this pool to enable liquid FX trades and eventually work towards instant, on chain cross border remittance between SGD-IDR and SGD-PHP. Ripple has famously tried to achieve this “on demand liquidity” but stablecoin FX is the true 10x improvement to traditional financial rails. This is especially true as stablecoin rails are able to offer end to end remittances at <1 % per transaction (if anyone is interested, we have a real world cost breakdown). This real world use case will bring sustainable fee generation via real economic activity to the BalancerDAO. Xave and StraitsX would like to work with the BalancerDAO to incentivize this initial pool with BAL rewards towards a real world use case in DeFi.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** \nGovernance will be done via snapshot for now. Later on Xave's own ve governance structure will be deployed (forked from veBAL). Current admin of the XSGD:USDC FXPool is the team's ops 3/5 multisig 0x74042CE43D1e74FF5627B1e9ff2ee950251b5Db4 (Polygon), until the community is ready to take on ownership of the Xave protocol. \n\n2. **Oracles:** \nThe xSGD:USDC FXPool utilizes a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the “beta region”), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the “beta region” where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the “beta region”, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the “beta region”. See reply for linked docs to learn more\n\n3. **Audits:** \nhttps://docs.xave.finance/contract-audits/v2-final-audit\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** \n⅗ operations multisig that owns contracts until contracts are “battle tested” and community is ready to takeover\n\n5. **Tokens:** \nxSGD is an asset backed stablecoin, fully collateralized and issued by StraitsX - a licensed and regulated Singaporean entity by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\n\nUSDC is an asset backed stablecoin issued by Centre\n \n6. **Value:** \nThis pool consists of the first native POS XSGD issued token by its' issuer https://www.straitsx.com/sg who will concentrate liquidity for real world use cases dependent on capital efficient on chain FX to support cross border settlement in the Southeast Asian region ++.\n\nDeposit/Withdraw/Swap: [Xave](https://app.xave.finance/#/pool/) (Switch to Polygon network)\nPolygon Root Gauge address: [PolygonRootGauge | Address 0xe42382D005A620FaaA1B82543C9c04ED79Db03bA | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe42382D005A620FaaA1B82543C9c04ED79Db03bA)",

Xave does this by building an FX accurate AMM via a custom “FXPool '' now and eventually a stablecoin lending market that shares liquidity with the Balancer V2 Vault via a BoostedFXPool.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:** \nPasting links in reply due to new user limit\n\n**Protocol Description:**\nXave has deployed its first custom pool type - the FXPool - that brings FX markets and lending to the Balancer DAO. \n\n**Motivation:** **“Bringing FX markets to the Balancer ecosystem”**\n\nStasis, the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoins EURS, and its community will be supporting this pool to enable liquid FX trades and eventually work towards instant, on chain cross border remittance between Europe and Asia (EUR-SGD, EUR-PHP, EUR-IDR).

The FXPools have various parameters (read more https://docs.xave.co/product-overview-1/amm) that affect the range of FX accurate swaps across the bonding curve. These parameters are updated and optimized over time, thus the need for nimble response while the pool is new.\n\n2. **Oracles:** \nThe EURS:USDC FXPool utilizes a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve.

Every GBPT token is fully FIAT backed by 1 GBP in our bank account.\n\nOur vision is to enable both retail consumers and financial institutions to leverage the power of GBP within the DeFi space and beyond. We are looking to Balancer as a great entry point into the arena and are excited to be offering exclusive incentives for those looking to help PoundToken in this initial distribution phase.\n\nPoundToken is planning to set up a GBPT:USDC FX Pool that will enable liquidity providers to earn BAL Emissions as well as a starting 2% yield on all GBPT that is provisioned into the pool.\n\n# **References/Useful links**\n\nLinks:\n\n* Website\n  * https://poundtoken.io/\n* Twitter (X)\n  * https://twitter.com/Poundtoken\n* Token\n  * https://etherscan.io/token/0x86b4dbe5d203e634a12364c0e428fa242a3fba98\n* Audits\n  * https://resources.poundtoken.io/tech-audits/\n* Attestations\n  * https://resources.poundtoken.io/reports/attestations/\n* Proof Of Reserve\n  * https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/reserves/gbpt-por\n* CEX\n  * https://www.gate.io/price/poundtoken-gbpt\n* Contract Address\n  * https://etherscan.io/address/0xC58150838855a5605C9030398c6D22afd5Bb09EE\n* Pool\n* Gauge w/ 2% Cap: [0xc5e66bB9fE27b7Cef4B64557Ad8398437730DD33](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5e66bB9fE27b7Cef4B64557Ad8398437730DD33#readContract)\n  * https://app.xave.co/#/pool\n\n# **Protocol Description**\n\nPoundToken has primarily been used OTC and listed on CEXs such as gate.io. We are now however looking to leverage Xave’s FXPool to enable an accurate stablecoin exchange between GBPT & USDC for the Balancer DAO and its community.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nPoundToken will continue to build use cases for this pool to encourage more liquid FX trades. We are looking to distribute GBPT further into the Ethereum ecosystem while at the same time starting to scale out our offering to multiple L2s so that we can issue natively on them.\n\nA great use case we are already exploring is enabling local UK based companies that are typically taking payments or receiving investments in USDC right now to be able to swap into GBPT to reduce their FX exposure. This pool would play a pivotal role in enabling this.\n\n# **Specifications**\n\n1. **Governance:** \nGovernance of the pool will be done via snapshot for now.\n\n2. **Oracles:**\nBy leveraging Xave’s FXPools the GBPT:USDC pair will utilize a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the “beta region”), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the “beta region” where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the “beta region”, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the “beta region”.\n\n3. **Audits:**\nhttps://resources.poundtoken.io/tech-audits/\nhttps://docs.xave.co/contract-audits/fxpool-final-audit\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:**\n3/3 operations multisig that owns contracts until contracts are “battle tested” and community is ready to takeover. The owner of the pool will be changed to the Balancer recommended address 0xbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalb once the pool has been running for sometime without issue to allow for quick response time in the event of an emergency. Until then the Xave operations multisig will be assigned as the pool’s owner.\n\n5. **Market History:** \nGBPT is an asset backed stablecoin, fully collateralized and issued by BlackFridge - the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoin GBPT. USDC is an asset backed stablecoin issued by Circle\n\n6. **Value:**\nFXPools deployed on Xave are highly capital efficient allowing for the pool to support larger trade volumes despite the minimal liquidity.\n\n**Specification**: \n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xc5e66bB9fE27b7Cef4B64557Ad8398437730DD33`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

VCHF is backed by Swiss Francs and issued by VNX, and jCHF is backed by crypto and is issued by the Jarvis Network.\n\n# References/Useful links:\n\n## Jarvis Network:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Website:[ https://jarvis.network/](https://jarvis.network/)\n* Documentation:[ https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network/)\n* Code:[ jarvis-network / apps / Mono-repo / Synthereum · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/mono-repo)\n* Social:[ https://twitter.com/Jarvis_Network](https://twitter.com/Jarvis_Network)\n* Audits:[ Add SynthereumV6 audit report (f50be59f) · Commits · jarvis-network / apps / Mono-repo / Synthereum · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/mono-repo/-/commit/f50be59fbe43304302c51d90c24aaa97d1320b73)\n\n## VNX:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Websites:[ https://vnx.li/](https://vnx.li/)\n* Code:[ https://gitlab.com/vnx/ethereum-contracts](https://gitlab.com/vnx/ethereum-contracts)\n* Social:[ https://twitter.com/vnx_platform](https://twitter.com/vnx_platform)\n* Audits:[ https://vnx.li/transparency/](https://vnx.li/transparency/)\n\n# Protocol Description:\n\n## Jarvis Network\n\nJarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.\n\nThe Synthereum protocol has four modules:\n\n* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.\n* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.\n* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.\n* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.\n\nMost jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (VNX, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be borrowed on jarvis.money, can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy).\n\n## VNX\n\nVNX, a Liechtenstein-based company licensed by the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA), is developing a more secure and reliable infrastructure for global transactions by introducing gold-backed and fiat stablecoins.\n\nVNX fiat stablecoins expands investor capabilities in the crypto space by offering digital assets referencing fiat currencies. The first fiat referencing tokens presented to the market were VNX Euro (VEUR) and VNX Swiss Franc (VCHF). VNX stablecoins provide the ability for crypto users to trade in their native currencies as well as manage their portfolio more effectively: to hedge, trade, and profit with more options.\n\nVNX Gold (VNXAU) is the first European multichain token backed by physical gold certified by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and represents individual ownership of the gold (1 VNXAU token is equal to 1 gram of physical gold). With VNX Gold investors can get the same benefits as investing in physical gold, such as store of value, protection against volatility and inflation, and high liquidity – with complete digital convenience and freedom. The physical gold backing VNXAU is stored in an isolated, high-security vault in Liechtenstein, a country with stable economy, S&P AAA rating and an EEA member.\n\nVNX tokens are traded on crypto exchanges such as LBank, BitForex,[ XT.COM](http://xt.com/) and Emirex, and the list of trading venues is growing, so stay tuned to keep updated.\n\nToken generation and all token services are carried out by VNX Commodities, a company registered with the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA) under the TT Token Providers and Services Act (TVTG). The list of licenses can be found at the regulator’s registry at this[ link](https://fmaregister.fma-li.li/search?searchText=&number=310339&category=).\n\nThe total funding for the project is 7.3 million euros with the lead investor Woori Technology Investment (South Korea).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThere is no yield or on-chain liquidity for CHF Stablecoins, and the latter are yet to be integrated within DeFi.\n\nThe role of the 2chf (VCHF) pool is to increase the stability of VCHF (1), the on-chain liquidity of both VCHF and jCHF (2), and connect the VNX and Jarvis ecosystems (3). Together, these 3 points allow for building a Swiss DeFi ecosystem.\n\n1. VCHF peg: VCHF maintains its pegged thanks to on/off-chain arbitrages, since it is redeemable for CHF at a 1:1 ratio. The 2chf (VCHF) pool would enable arbitrages to happen entirely on-chain, increasing VCHF stability.\n2. On-chain liquidity:\n\n* VCHF: since jCHF can be exchanged for USDC without price impact, then exchanging jCHF or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap VCHF to jCHF and then to USDC to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases VCHF liquidity.\n* jCHF: jCHF main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jCHF minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets), and this is why we are launching this pool.\n\n3. Connect ecosystems: the 2chf pool connects VNX and its VCHF to the jCHF’s ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases.\n\n* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: on Polygon, VCHF can be minted from CHF and redeemed for CHF; this provides a DeFi entry and exit point for Swiss people.\n* Credit without FX risk: borrow jCHF, swap for VCHF then off-ramp VCHF.\n\n## A few notes\n\n* Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) has a position in TETU.\n* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).\n* Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield.\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1. Governance:\n\n* Jarvis: no on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (only one team member in the signers).\n  * Polygon: 0x2709fa6FA31BD336455d4F96DdFC505b3ACA5A68\n  * VNX has no on-chain governance.\n\n2. Oracles: jCHF uses CHFUSD Chainlink Price Feed.\n3. Audits:\n\n* Jarvis:[ https://learn.jarvis.network/risks-warning/audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/risks-warning/audits)\n* VNX: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CnBOk9PMyLbYMU5Nf0GgrOO4Y4h8kuRY/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CnBOk9PMyLbYMU5Nf0GgrOO4Y4h8kuRY/view)\n\n4. Centralizing vector: jCHF is mainly collateralized by USDC; VNX is backed by Swiss Francs.\n5. Market history: jCHF has been live since August 2021 (on Polygon); it has never traded off its peg. However, it has inherited from a bad debt following the hack of Midas earlier this year. As a result, 237k jCHF are not collateralized. Despite this, jCHF has held its peg. VCHF has never lost its peg.\n6. Value:\n\n* The 2chf (VCHF) pool will act as the main route on and off-ramp on Polygon for Swiss users and main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, credit without FX risks, etc.).\n\n# Contracts\n\n* 2chf pool: [0x70fF0078d55cE9C1A0E668f35eb4400a4300122D](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x70ff0078d55ce9c1a0e668f35eb4400a4300122d000000000000000000000beb)\n* 2chf gauge: [0x852580e3E1C0Fd35DE426C5481670c1772525265](https://etherscan.io/address/0x852580e3E1C0Fd35DE426C5481670c1772525265#readContract)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x852580e3E1C0Fd35DE426C5481670c1772525265`\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon`",

        "body": "[PR with pull request](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/72)\n\n**Proposal to add TRYB / USDC to Gauge Controller:**\n\nThis authors: BiLira Team with support from Aura contributors.\n\n**Summary:**\n> This is a proposal to enable a Balancer gauge for the [TRYB / USDC Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x15c1cdacd3da1e1c1304200b1beb080d50bbbc0f00020000000000000000045f). This pool consists of 50% USDC - Circle’s USD stablecoin, and 50% TRYB(BiLira), a Turkish Lira backed and 1:1 collateralized ERC-20 compatible stablecoin. The gauge will be with a 2% emission cap.\n>\n>Pairing TRYB with USDC will enable direct transfers between Turkish Lira and USDC allowing the Turkish community to directly use DeFi applications by using Balancer to swap their tokens. Furthermore, there are several benefits associated with enabling a gauge for TRYB/ USDC pool:\n>* Increased Liquidity: Turkish traders will have access to deeper liquidity than before which should lead to lower spreads between buy/sell prices resulting in an improved trading performance\n>* Greater Accessibility: By including TRYB in the Balancer Protocol alongside other popular currencies like USDT and USDC, traders around the world, including Turkish traders, will have greater access to invest and manage their funds digitally through a well-respected decentralized finance protocol like Balancer.\n>* Yields and Transaction Fees: While Turkish investors will be able to enjoy the benefits of utilizing Balancer in the most accessible manner; at the same time, Balancer will earn additional yields from fees collected from trading activities within the platform. BiLira will act as an on/off ramp for the community and they will benefit from Balancer directly.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    •  [Website](https://www.bilira.co/en/home)\n    •  [Audit Reports](https://www.bilira.co/en/audit-reports)\n    •  [Issuance & Redemption](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sj3zdgjM1Wip5yBb-hIgkYtCJ_vqXK2u/view)\n    •  [Documentation](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fb683a258cbdf70262c0b77/6023c066d244a79a1c000761_Whitepaper-(EN-1.0).pdf)\n    •  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BiLira_Official)\n    •  Contracts: [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2c537e5624e4af88a7ae4060c022609376c8d0eb), [Avalanche](https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x564a341df6c126f90cf3ecb92120fd7190acb401), [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4fb71290ac171e1d144f7221d882becac7196eb5), [Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/A94X2fRy3wydNShU4dRaDyap2UuoeWJGWyATtyp61WZf), [BNB](https://bscscan.com/address/0xC1fdbed7Dac39caE2CcC0748f7a80dC446F6a594)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> The BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on 5 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards. Users can use the web application on [BiLira.co](http://bilira.co) to conduct TRYB issuances and redemptions between their local banks and their digital wallets.\n>\n>The minting of on-chain TRYB is from fully collateralized bank deposits. Users connect their wallets and deposit fiat currency (TRY) into BiLira’s bank account. BiLira confirms the transaction and verifies the smart contract. The smart contract then mints corresponding TRYB tokens and sends them to the customer’s crypto wallet. Corresponding fiat currency is held in BiLira’s reserves. This information can be verified through our audit reports that are done via 3 party firms.(link to the reports can be found below). Another factor is that BiLira doesn’t hold the users crypto assets. The issuance process is non-custodial and the assets are sent to the users wallet addresses that they provide. For redemption, users send their TRYB to their BiLira redemption wallets, and convert the specified TRYB to Turkish Lira through [bilira.co](https://www.bilira.co/). All of the redeemed TRYB from customers are burned in a monthly routine. BiLira firm uses enterprise-grade multi-layer security measures such as Multi-Sig wallets through Fireblocks.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Cryptocurrency adoption in Turkey is one of the highest in the world and continues to grow as a result of the increasing demand for digital assets and financial services. A survey by [ING](https://www.ing.com.tr/F/Documents/27062018_ING_IIS_BB.pdf) illustrates that almost 18% of Turkish people have used or owned cryptocurrency in some form, compared to 9% across the European Union. This has been driven by the high inflation rate and economic uncertainty that has been experienced in Turkey over the last few years. The Turkish Lira (TRY) has been especially severely impacted, with its value dropping by over 40% since the beginning of 2020. As a result, Turkish users actively seek for alternative financial instruments and solutions.\nBy creating the [TRYB/USDC pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x15c1cdacd3da1e1c1304200b1beb080d50bbbc0f), we wanted to open the gates of Balancer to the Turkish DeFi users.\n>\n>With such a large base of crypto users, TRYB pools on Balancer would provide Turkish users with easy access to the decentralized finance ecosystem and make it easier for them to adopt and trade crypto assets. \n>\n>Furthermore, by incentivizing TRYB on Balancer there will be an incentive for users to provide liquidity and actively swap tokens. This will consequently result in more users joining the platform and increased trading volumes. As more of the Turkish community join and more people begin using TRYB tokens for their transactions or contribute to the relevant liquidity pool, traders will have more opportunities to arbitrage between different exchanges and earn profits from price discrepancies across markets. We are planning to to work with Aura to help create deep liquidity and engage with the aura/vlAURA community \n\n**Specifications:**\n You may find the full details on the project in the BiLira whitepaper and for all the other information please refer to [BiLira homepage.](https://www.bilira.co/en/home)\n1. **Governance:** \nTRYB is centralized and issued by BiLira and does not have a governance forum.\n\n2. **Oracles:** \nTRYB has a Chainlink oracle that can be found here: [Oracle\n](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat/try-usd)\n\n3. **Audits:** \nBiLira’s TRYB is being audited twice a year by an independent auditor to ensure all TRYB’s are fully backed by TRY. [See the latest audits here](https://www.bilira.co/en/audit-reports).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** \nTRYB is inherently centralized and issued by BiLira. Users who complete the KYC/AML process are allowed to issue and redeem TRYB for TRY 24/7. \n\n\n5. **Market History:** \nTRYB has been on blockchains since early 2019. It has been listed and used on numerous DEXs and CEXs since its launch. Until today more than 5 billion TRYB has been issued by BiLira to fulfill the user demand. [See Coingecko history here.](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bilira)\nFrom August 2020 and up until 31 October 2022, TRYB was within +/-1% of the peg 93.14% of the time and within +/-2% 98.90% of the time.\nThere are some market places where there is lack of liquidity which does not make a sufficient impact on the peg. Outliers on the TRYB/TRY peg distribution rarely occur on these marketplaces with relatively less volume. However, TRYB peg is guaranteed with the TRY held in the bank account of BiLira. Users can always redeem TRYB for TRY(1:1) via [this link.](https://app.bilira.co/redemptions)\n\nPool: [TRYB/USDC](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x15c1cdacd3da1e1c1304200b1beb080d50bbbc0f00020000000000000000045f)\nGauge w/ 2% emission: [Gauge Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x36365dA262dB3965Ba2E1C4411409Bf22508e0A1)\n\n \n6. **Value:** \nAs explained above, the Turkish community will benefit from providing liquidity to Balancer. Many people will be interested in moving over to Balancer. We will also be actively participating in the ecosystem, such as work with Aura to help create deep liquidity and engage with all the communities both Turkish and global to try to improve the experience.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call performAction with the GaugeController at `0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD` for the target(address) argument and using 0x3a04f900 followed by the gauge address `0x36365dA262dB3965Ba2E1C4411409Bf22508e0A1` and the corresponding gauge type for the data(bytes) argument.\n\ndata(bytes) : `0x3a04f90000000000000000000000000036365da262db3965ba2e1c4411409bf22508e0a10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`",
