        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce LT and LTV for USDC on Aave V2\n\n# Motivation\n\nFollowing our [ongoing reduction](https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766) of stablecoin LTs and LTVs on Aave V3 markets, we propose reducing LTs and LTVs on V2 to limit risks posed by the current parameters and align them closer to V3’s parameters. \n\nIt is important to note that in some cases, it is difficult to reduce LTs because of users looping assets with themselves. For example, on Ethereum, there are 58 wallets that are both supplying and borrowing more than 10,000 USDC. This leads us to recommend two different options on which the community can decide: a more aggressive LT reduction, which will result in more liquidations but help reduce LT more quickly and a conservative LT reduction, which will prioritize limiting liquidations. For all options, we recommend decreasing LTV to the target of 75%. \n\n## LT/LTV Reduction\n\nThe overall goal of our stablecoin LT/LTV reduction is the same as on V3, ultimately achieving the following parameters:\n\n| Final LTV | Final LT |\n| --- | --- |\n| 75.00% | 78.00% |\n\n***USDC (Ethereum)***\n\nCurrently, reducing LT would require inducing a significant number of liquidations; a reduction of just 0.50% would create $137K in new liquidations, and a 2% reduction would create $200K in new liquidations. This is largely caused by two users ([1](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb60bda0bab52839a3334bd849d2afb2aa566e631), [2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xf451d30a7ac2e56f52a36825b155b0ac1fb7a867)), both of whom are looping USDC with itself. Thus, our conservative proposal is not adjusting LT, while the aggressive calls for reducing it by 0.50%.\n| Asset | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservative | - | - |\n| Aggressive | 137.3K | 10 |\n\n***USDC.e (Polygon)***\n\nSimilar to USDC on Ethereum, it is difficult to reduce the LT without inducing large liquidations, thus the conservative proposal calls for a reduction to 84.50%.\n\nThe three largest potential liquidations ([1](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb3095b2861fba8ebcfd199546ce9488c75676850),[2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0x299b189f47838ee8ebb630c3024bb1cd9f109ee8),[3](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0x818b84cc4c3012cb6b36bfb627fd82438718fc7c)), representing the majority of new value eligible for liquidation, are all wallets that are looping USDC.e with itself.\n\nThe more aggressive approach would reduce LT to 83% and potentially induce $103K worth of liquidations.\n\n| Asset | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservative | 10K | 45 |\n| Aggressive | 103K | 235 |\n\n\n***USDC.e (Avalanche)***\n\nOur approach involves reducing USDC.e’s LT to 78%, inducing $10,300 worth of liquidations across 11 new wallets.\n\nAgain, the largest liquidation would be a [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xdb815d4071c3d8b2ebec6c003f30bfbfa6a5d8b8) who is looping USDC.e. This would bring the market in line with our final parameters, and thus there is no need for an aggressive proposal.\n\n# Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec LT (Moderate/Aggressive) | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| Ethereum | USDC | 80.00% | 75.00% | 87.50% | No Change / 87.00% | \n| Polygon | USDC.e | 80.00% | 75.00% | 85.00% | 84.50% / 83.00% | \n| Avalanche | USDC.e | 75.00% | No Change | 80.00% | 78.00% | \n\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0) -  borrowing $3.11M DAI against his 5,914 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 52% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2. [0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05) -  borrowing $1.84M USDC against his 4,077 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 31% of the debt ceiling.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the **frozen** V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. \n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. \n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n- “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |\n| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |\n| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |\n| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |\n- “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |\n| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |\n| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum. \n\nGiven the current conditions and protocol usage, we propose 2 options for the community to vote on:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-CRV-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-7-10-32dc4ed994be4029b05af831ce5ea537).\n2. “Moderate” - 3% reduction. This option is aligned with the previous reduction and the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nIn the table below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. \n\n| Option | Liquidation Threshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Moderate | 52 | 3 | $46 |\n| Aggressive | 49 | 5 | $116 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to increase the debt ceiling of SNX and MKR on V3 Ethereum\n\n## Motivation\n\n### SNX\n\nThe current debt ceiling for SNX on V3 Ethereum set at $2.5M, has reached 94% utilization.\n\nGiven current market conditions our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling to $4M.\n\nIt is important to note that the majority of SNX debt positions are concentrated within two accounts, accounting for over 90% of the total debt, as outlined below. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future recommendations and cases of significant market changes.\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing SNX as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0x09d86d566092bec46d449e72087ee788937599d2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x09d86d566092bec46d449e72087ee788937599d2) - borrowing $1.81M in stables (USDC and USDT) against his 1.4M SNX collateral, accounting for nearly 73% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.59.\n2. [0x97cfb214adcd7243efd6b491a6c719c493d04122](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x97cfb214adcd7243efd6b491a6c719c493d04122) - borrowing ~$448K USDT against his ~595K SNX collateral, accounting for nearly 18% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 2.73.\n\n\n### MKR\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum set at $8.5M, has reached 99% utilization.\n\nGiven current market conditions our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling to $12M.\n\nThere are currently four major users using MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum, utilizing 87.5% of the debt ceiling. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future recommendations and cases of significant market changes\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\n1.

The user's current health score is 1.81.\n3. [0xf47841f562689ad85363b41c235d61136c0ccf26](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xf47841f562689ad85363b41c235d61136c0ccf26) - borrowing ~$801K USDC against his ~1.04K MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 9.5% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.79.\n4. [0x1e7267fa2628d66538822fc44f0edb62b07272a4](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x1e7267fa2628d66538822fc44f0edb62b07272a4) - borrowing ~$711K in stables (USDC and USDT) against his ~700 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 8% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.59.\n\n## Specification:\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SNX | Debt Ceiling | 2,500,000 | 4,000,000 |\n| MKR | Debt Ceiling | 8,500,000 | 12,000,000 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
