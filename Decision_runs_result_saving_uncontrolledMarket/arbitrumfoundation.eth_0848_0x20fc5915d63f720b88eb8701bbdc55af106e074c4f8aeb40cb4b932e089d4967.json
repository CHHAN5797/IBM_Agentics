Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.\n\nOnce the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.\n\n...\n\n## Overall cost\n\n1,500,000 ARB distributed monthly over 6 months, for a total of 9M ARB tokens.",

        "body": "### Summary\nRage Trade is submitting an amended proposal per the [Clarified Process for Non-Council Recommended Applications](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257).\nTo recap, Rage Trade submitted [a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621) to run weekly and daily trading competitions in the LTIPP initial review round. The proposal aimed to allocate 100% of the LTIPP grant to onboard and reward users via these competitions. The focus was on trading competitions rather than fee rebates because competitions could significantly level the playing field  — ultimately boosting participation. The initial proposal was, however, declined by the council due to two issues: \n- A large ask (1.25M ARB)\n- Too few details on how wash trading risks are handled during the competition.\n\nRage Trade has now made amendments to the initial proposal, including: \n- A reduced ask of 425k ARB \n- Highlighting already existing wash trading measures, including: \n   - Enforcing a minimum trade size\n   - Calculating trader ROI based on the average collateral used during a competition round to ensure fairness between large and small traders\n\nLink to Application Revisions:\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/14\n\n### Revised feedback:\n- [GFXlabs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/15):\n> As one of the initial reviewers, we feel our concerns were addressed and would score this proposal considerably higher. The applicant correctly identified and revised the areas of the grant plan we scored as the weakest and would likely receive a passing grade from GFX if reevaluated formally.\nAs a reminder, the LTIP pilot rules did not allow applicants the ability to revise after formal submission, and so were not able to react to feedback in real time from reviewers.\nAs a second reminder, all reviewers have their own opinions and views, and may or may not overlap on some topics.\n- [404DAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/16):\n> As another reviewer of Rage Trade’s application, we also echo that our initial concerns have been addressed with these revisions.

Gearbox has a unique and novel product that complements DeFi well and is very composable. They have proven their ability to achieve PMF and work with incentives\nThey provided clear objectives, KPIs, and goals, and a sufficient justification for their requested grant size.\nTheir execution strategy has a nice focus on migrating their existing users to Arbitrum while focusing on hot sectors in DeFi. We would’ve liked have seen a bit more details in their execution strategy regarding rewarding trading volume and anti-sybil measures.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nWe’re hesitant at this level of grant funding, but the applicant has demonstrated exceptional adoption on mainnet in recent months. The strong performance and track record of the applicant generally overcomes the large size of the request to what is effectively to deploy to Arbitrum.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nGearbox’s proposal introduces a unique feature called Credit Accounts, an account abstraction primitive that has the potential to attract significant capital to Arbitrum. The objectives outlined in the proposal are clear, well-defined, and aligned with driving growth and innovation within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Their execution strategy, incorporating mechanisms such as farming and incentivizing margin trading, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to achieving the program's goals. The allocation of resources and incentives across different pools and strategies reflects a strategic focus on driving user engagement and liquidity provision.\n\n\nThe proposed timeline and milestones are realistic, offering a clear pathway for assessing progress throughout the grant period. Emphasizing target utilization ratios and total transaction volume underscores a commitment to driving user adoption and engagement, vital for the success of any protocol. Furthermore, their strategy to incentivize stickiness through continued integration with other protocols highlights a long-term commitment to enhancing composability within the ecosystem, benefiting not only Gearbox but also other projects and the overall Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n\nAdditionally, Gearbox has a proven track record of innovation, attracting users with both simplistic interfaces and high yields, such as their leveraged ETH EigenPoint system.

        "body": "Abstract:\nThis Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) is presented with the vision of further enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Acknowledging the STIP’s instrumental role in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, this proposal seeks to extend its positive impact by introducing a gas rebate and trading incentive program created by Rage Trade, a native perp aggregator on Arbitrum. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only complement the milestones achieved by the STIP but also to significantly increase the influx of new traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMotivation:\nAs the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) kicks off, it sets the stage for the Arbitrum ecosystem to experience amplified growth. The STIP is poised to play a pivotal role in promoting on-chain activities and reinforcing key protocols. However, there is plenty of opportunity to intensify user engagement and participation, especially when considering innovative platforms like Rage Trade.\n\nThis proposal is driven by the ambition to harness this potential, acting synergistically with the anticipated successes of the STIP. Through Rage Trade’s introduction of a gas rebate and trading incentive program, our objective is not just to elevate trading activity, but also to enhance the overall user experience, attracting and onboarding new traders to the ecosystem. This effort is geared towards empowering platforms that, in line with Arbitrum’s vision, are poised for growth but require additional support to maximize their contribution.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to foster a dynamic and engaged community. By allocating 100% of the grant funds to create a gas rebate and trading incentives program, Rage Trade’s platform aims to refine the user experience of traders while offering gas savings and trading incentives to stimulate a competitive yet cooperative environment.\n\nSpecifications: A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.\nRage Trade Platform:\n\nAs a prime broker and perpetual aggregator, Rage Trade unifies top decentralized perpetual exchanges across all EVM-compatible chains. It streamlines the trading experience by eliminating complexities associated with collateral and gas fund management, ensuring a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly environment for traders.\n\nGas Tank Mechanism:\n\nThe Gas Tank is a unique feature of Rage Trade that simplifies trading across different chains. Users deposit funds into their account, and a portion goes into the Gas Tank. This fund is then used to cover gas fees across various chains, eliminating the need for users to manage gas fees separately.\n\nSession-Based Trading System:\n\nRage Trade employs a session-based trading system where users create a session that lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days). This system reduces the need for manual transaction signing, making the trading experience smoother and more akin to centralized exchanges.\n\nMulti-Leg Trading and Auto-Populating Bridge:\n\nThe platform allows users to create multiple trades from different chains and perps on Arbitrum, enabling them to spread risk and optimize execution. Additionally, Rage Trade handles all the bridging details, automatically selecting the best bridge or swap routes for seamless trade execution.\n\nCustom Route Selection:\n\nUsers have the option to split their orders based on various criteria such as best execution price, lowest funding fees, or routes with bonuses like emissions or airdrops. This feature provides flexibility and optimization for trade execution.\n\nAggregated Referral & Competitions:\n\nRage Trade aggregates referrals and competitions across different perp protocols, allowing users to participate in various trading competitions and referral programs through a single platform.\n\nIncentive Distribution:\n\nThe proposal involves the distribution of 1.5 million ARB tokens to incentivize trading volume on Rage Trade. The distribution will be structured to reward active traders and participants in trading competitions, fostering increased engagement and liquidity on the platform.\n\nTrading Competitions:\n\nA series of trading competitions will be organized, with ARB tokens allocated as prizes. These competitions aim to attract traders, boost trading volume, and create a vibrant trading community on Rage Trade.\n\nUser Engagement and Performance Metrics:\nRage Trade has successfully cultivated a dynamic user base, boasting 70,000 active traders who regularly engage with our platform. This robust participation is a testament to our platform’s appeal and functionality within the trading community.\n\nIn addition to our active traders, we have nurtured a strong Liquidity Provider (LP) community, with 26,000 LPs contributing to our ecosystem. This substantial number of LPs underscores our platform’s reliability and the trust placed in us by those who provide liquidity, further cementing our role as a pivotal player in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our protocol’s historical performance not only demonstrates significant growth and adoption but also highlights our consistent delivery of value to our users, traders, and liquidity providers. These metrics are indicative of our integral position within the Arbitrum ecosystem and our potential to further enhance and expand our offerings with sustained support.\n\nRage’s Perpetual Performance:\n\nRage Trade v1 has experienced a remarkable market reception, evidenced by a staggering $735M in Total Trading Volume against Rage’s Total Value Locked (TVL). This impressive figure reflects the high demand and active engagement within our user base, showcasing the platform’s appeal and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n962×642 21.9 KB\nRage’s Vaults Performance:\n\nOur vault offerings, including the 80-20 Tricrypto Vault and GLP Vault, have achieved a notable peak TVL of approximately $19.87 million (at 100% max capacity since launch). This achievement highlights the trust and confidence users place in our vault products.\n\nAt its peak, Rage Trade accounted for about 1.4% of the entire Arbitrum TVL, marking our significant contribution to the overall ecosystem. This percentage represents our substantial impact and the value we add to the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThe 80-20 Tricrypto vault, in particular, has demonstrated exceptional performance. Over its 10-month lifespan, it outperformed holding GLP by 8%. Specifically, from July 2022 to April 2023, the 80-20 Tricrypto vault yielded a 44% return compared to a 36% return from merely holding GLP, showcasing its effectiveness and profitability.\n\nSteps to Implement: The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.\nTo implement this proposal, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring each phase contributes effectively to the overall goal. Here’s how we plan to proceed:\n\nData Reporting and Transparency: Rage Trade is committed to transparency and will implement Dune dashboards for real-time tracking of all relevant metrics. These dashboards will ensure community members have access to up-to-date data, reflecting our progress and adherence to the commitments outlined in this proposal. This approach emphasizes our dedication to transparency and accountability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIncentive Allocation: We will begin by using a portion of the ARB tokens for our gas rebate program to offset gas fees for our users. This will serve as the initial spark to ignite trading activities on the Rage Trade platform.\n\nFee Offset & Trading Competitions: We will then allocate the remaining tokens to incentivize trading, including trade competitions and offsetting fees implemented by integrated perp protocols. The trading competitions will be strategically scheduled over time to ensure ongoing participation and interest.\n\nRegular Updates and Reporting: Throughout the implementation, we will continuously monitor platform performance, trader engagement, and community feedback. This will allow us to make real-time adjustments and improvements where necessary. To maintain transparency, we will provide the community with regular updates and reports. These will include key performance metrics and insights gained from the implementation process.\n\nReview and Analysis: At the end of the implementation phase, we will conduct a thorough review. This will involve analyzing successes, identifying areas for improvement, and extracting key learnings for future initiatives.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to ensure not just the successful implementation of the proposal but also to contribute valuable insights for the continuous growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nTimeline: Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\nThe implementation of this proposal is structured into a 4-month period, with each month focusing on specific objectives and milestones:\n\nMonth 1 - Initiation and Setup (Immediately upon approval):\n\nAllocation of ARB tokens to the designated multisig wallet to immediately initiate gas rebates and trading fee offsets. Setup of the Dune dashboard for tracking key metrics such as trading volume and unique traders. Announcement of the initiative and upcoming trading competitions to the community.\n\nMonth 2 - Launch of Trading Competitions:\n\nOfficial launch of the first set of trading competitions.\n\nActive monitoring of trading activities and engagement levels.\n\nFirst monthly update provided to the community, highlighting early results and trader participation.\n\nMonth 3 - Mid-term Review and Adjustments:\n\nComprehensive review of the first two months, analyzing trader engagement and competition outcomes.\n\nAdjustments made to competitions and incentives based on feedback and data analysis.\n\nSecond monthly update provided, including insights and any changes implemented.\n\nMonth 4 - Final Push and Comprehensive Analysis:\n\nContinued incentivization and promotion of trading activities.\n\nFinal monthly update provided, leading up to the comprehensive quarterly report.\n\nPreparation of the detailed analysis report, evaluating the proposal’s success based on predefined objectives.\n\nPost-4-Month Period - Evaluation and Reporting:\n\nRelease of a comprehensive quarterly report, detailing the overall impact of the proposal on trading volume, trader engagement, and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Evaluation of the initiative’s success and consideration of potential future actions based on the outcomes.\n\nThis timeline ensures a structured approach to implementing the proposal, with regular updates and transparency. It allows for adjustments based on real-time data and community feedback, ensuring the initiative remains aligned with its goal of driving growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTo measure the success of achieving the grant objectives, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nDaily Volume: Aiming for a 30-day moving average of $10M in daily volume.\nDaily Traders: Targeting a 30-day moving average of 300 unique traders.\nIntegration: Committing to integrate 1 or more perpetual DEXes per 2 weeks (accounting for audit time).\nThese KPIs will serve as benchmarks to gauge our progress and effectiveness in utilizing the grant to drive growth and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nRage Trade aims to leverage the grant to attract a substantial influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, bolstering user interaction, transaction volume, TVL, and overall activity.\n\nStrategically, Rage Trade will allocate ~ 33% of the grant to gas rebates, with the other ~ 66% of the grant being directed towards offsetting integrated perp protocols’ trading fees and various trading competitions. The endgame is to amplify user onboarding and trading enthusiasm, resonating with genuine market dynamics.\n\nIt’s crucial to clarify that rebate rates will be determined by the genuine fees incurred by users. If our partnering protocols grant separate rebates or rewards, Rage Trade commits to ensuring that the total sum of rebates will never surpass the fees accrued. Throughout this promotional phase, trade-to-earn schemes will not be entertained. Additionally, the Rage Trade team will vigilantly deter and counteract wash trading and Sybil-attack incidents. Offending addresses linked with such activities will be publicly disclosed and denied the associated rebates.\n\nGas Rebates Explained:\nOnce a week, traders will receive ARB tokens as a gas rebate, mirroring the gas fees they’ve incurred throughout the week. This rebate system ensures that users can trade more freely, knowing a portion of their gas fees will be returned. The gas rebate will be uniformly applied across all protocols integrated with Rage Trade on Arbitrum, ensuring fairness and consistency for all traders. The rebate amount a trader receives will be directly proportional to the actual gas fees they’ve paid, eliminating any potential for manipulative practices like trade-to-earn schemes.\n\nFee Rebates Explained:\n\nARB tokens will be rewarded as fee rebates to our traders every Friday, reflecting the fees they’ve accumulated over the week.\n\nThis fee waiver will be consistently applied across all collaborating protocols.\n\nTraders’ rebate entitlements will strictly correlate with their actual trading fees, nullifying the chance for trade-to-earn practices. The rate of expenditure from the grant will be contingent on the volume of organic trading transpiring each week. The Rage Trade team pledges to continually identify and thwart wash trading and sybil-attack attempts.\n\nTo safeguard the integrity of the campaign, the specifics of the anti-wash-trading & anti-sybil-attack measures will be kept confidential and will be communicated post-event, mirroring best practices employed in protocol airdrop launches.\n\nExample of Fee Structure Post-Reduction:\n\nIf additional perps trading mechanisms in the Arbitrum realm are incorporated with Rage Trade amidst this campaign, the fee waiver will extend to those as well.\n\nIntegrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction\n\nGMX V1: 0.1% → 0%\n\nGMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%\n\nOverall Cost: The total cost to implement the AIP.\nThe total cost to implement this AIP for Rage Trade is 1.5M ARB tokens. This cost is solely dedicated to funding trading competitions and volume incentives on the Rage Trade platform. The breakdown is as follows:\n\nGas Rebates: 500k ARB tokens will be allocated for offsetting gas fees when trading perps on Arbitrum.\n\nTrading Fee Rebates & Competitions: The remaining 1m ARB will be used as trading fee offsets and trading competitions.\n\nThere are no additional costs involved in this proposal. The entire 1.5M ARB token request is focused on directly incentivizing users and enhancing their trading experience on Rage Trade.",

        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces the STIP Bridge, aiming to sustain and enhance Arbitrum's market leadership by extending support to key protocols amidst intense competition from other Layer 2 solutions. \n\nIt serves as a strategic interim solution, maintaining incentive alignment and ensuring continuous engagement of vital projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem until the Perpetual Incentives Program is initiated.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is currently facing unprecedented competitive pressures, with significant incentive programs launched by rival Layer 2 networks threatening to attract our established protocols away. \n\nThe STIP Bridge is crucial for retaining these integral projects, ensuring they remain committed to Arbitrum by providing timely, targeted incentives. This initiative is essential to preserve network growth, user engagement, and overall ecosystem stability in a highly dynamic market environment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nAligning with Arbitrum's mission to support and nurture its development community, the STIP Bridge embodies our commitment to our builders and their contributions. It strategically addresses the imminent risk of losing key ecosystem participants to competitors by offering a seamless transition in incentive support. This approach not only retains critical projects and liquidity within Arbitrum but also sets a solid foundation for the impending comprehensive Perpetual Incentives Program, reinforcing our long-term vision of innovation and community empowerment.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Eligibility\n\n* Any protocol funded under STIP is eligible to apply for a bridge grant coinciding with the LTIPP distribution window.\n* This will allow Arbitrum to ensure protocols that had success during the STIP campaign can retain their users and continue to focus on building on Arbitrum.\n\n## Maximum Funding Size:\n\nMaximum funding requests under this bridge grant are capped based on a percentage of the prior funding received under STIP:\n\n* Greater than 500k ARB: may make a funding request of up to 50% of their prior funding.\n* Less than or equal to 500k ARB: may make funding requests up to 100% of their prior funding, capped at 250k ARB.\n\n## Addendum on STIP Forum post:\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project’s original STIP forum post, projects will be included in a list of all extension applicants. Specifically, a project should add the tag “STIP Bridge” to the end of their forum post. The addendum is intended to be relatively lightweight, not requiring a full STIP type proposal but should still include:\n\n* Requested amount (protocols have the option to size down their asks if they deem it more appropriate, including to help secure the support of delegates).\n* Data on the performance of their activities during STIP.\n* If the intended use of incentives is different than STIP, then details of the updated usage.\n* Links to bi-weekly STIP performance reports and Openblocks Dashboard.\n\n## Voting and Approval Mechanism:\n\n### Optimistic Approach\n\nAn optimistic voting mechanism will be used to mitigate the potential for delegate fatigue from voting on 50+ proposals while still holding projects accountable for their overall performance within STIP and in general.\n\nThis optimistic model hopes to reduce the load on all delegates but ensure that the DAO's full attention is placed on the more contentious proposals.\n\n### Voting Mechanism\n\nThe current snapshot and the immediately subsequent Tally vote will earmark funds to allow the DAO to distribute up to the maximum permissible grants.\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project's original STIP forum post, all properly submitted projects will be included in a list of extension applicants for consideration to be funded.\n\nDuring the challenge review period, any delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated can put up a forum post and an associated snapshot proposal that will result in a full DAO vote for the individual grant streams for it to be approved.  \n\nDelegates may seek a full DAO vote at their own discretion if they believe that a project did (a) not fulfill their STIP requirements, (b) failed to deliver tangible results during the STIP period or (c) the amount sought in the bridge application would not result in an effective utilization of the DAO’s funds.\n\nThis will allow the DAO delegates to focus their available attention to more closely examine contested applications. To be accepted into the bridge program alongside the unchallenged proposals, the proposal to fund must receive a supermajority (66%) of votes in favor.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* Send funds to STIP multisig\n* Create an addendum template for applicants\n* Have applicants post addendums\n* Conduct DAO challenge vote on Snapshot\n* Conduct individual Snapshot votes for any challenged application\n* Have successful applicants complete compliance\n* Start streams at the same time as LTIPP protocols\n* Monitored incentives throughout the program as done in STIP\n\n# Timeline\n\nThis is a rough timeline. We aim to start the STIP Bridge at the same time as LTIPP.\n\n* Week 1 (March 11 - 17)\n  * Posted to Governance Forum\n  * If requested, Community Call including discussion of Voting Mechanism\n* Week 2 (March 22 - 29)\n  * Snapshot Vote for the creation of Bridge Program\n* Week 3\n  * Tally Vote for establishing funding to LTIPP or community multisig (17 days)\n  * Start of 2-week window for protocols to submit addendums, protocols are encouraged but not obligated to submit early to allow delegates time to review\n* Week 4\n  * Continue addendum submissions\n* Week 5\n  * One week Optimistic Approval / Challenge Vote Period\n* Week 6\n  * Tally vote ends (17 days)\n  * Review and discussion period of remaining protocols not cleared in Optimistic / Challenge voting\n  * Vote on remaining contested applicants\n* Week 6\n  * STIP.b & LTIPP incentives start at the same time\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n\n## Incentives Budget: \n37,025,522 ARB\nSee estimated amounts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic15cTQNoa6xyIJcp-X8OC175MaCLMPrXtMW5eT87sI/edit#gid=1867228162)\n\nThe incentives budget above is the maximum allocation earmarked, any extra funds not used due to ineligible asks, projects not applying, or other reasons returned to the multisig. \n\n### Overhead: 0M ARB\n\n\n* Assumed to be the same data provider and multisig as STIP without added cost.\n* Analytics: This proposal should result in no material increase in work for the analytics vendor, given that the same team already covers STIP protocols, was mandated for making dashboards for the same, and is mandated for the entire time of LTIPP. Additionally, the multisig signing can be done at the same time as other disbursements or will use oSnap reducing the need for multi-sig signing.\n* If there is an objection, a volunteer multisig from the DAO will be assembled and community grants can be allocated by the LTIPP special grants for taking over the existing dashboards from STIP, as they are open source and IP rights if any already resides with the DAO.\n\n## Proposers:\nIncludes some proposers and developers of both STIP round 1, Backfund, LTIP and an LTIP Council member. \nAlex Lumley of SavvyDao, Dan Peng of Vela Exchange, CoinflipCanada of GMX",
