        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 deployment on zkSync Era Mainnet\n\nAuthor: @fig - Flipside Crypto\n\nDate: 2023-03-26\n\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\nThis Temperature Check seeks community input for the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet, expanding Aave’s presence and tapping into the growing zkEVM ecosystem.\n\n## Background\nzkSync is a zk rollup, a trustless protocol that uses cryptographic validity proofs to provide scalable and low-cost transactions on Ethereum. zkSync Era is made to look and feel like Ethereum, but with lower fees. Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is a delegate platform dedicated to actively participating in Aave governance and contributing to the protocol's success. As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward.\n\nTo continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact.\n\n## **ACI's current & future areas of focus**\n\n1. **Governance and AIP Development**\n    - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes\n    - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs\n    - Engaging with the community on forum discussions\n    - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders\n2. **Treasury Efficiency and Management**\n    - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management.\n    - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors.\n    - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation.\n    - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users.\n3. **Protocol and Ecosystem Development**\n    - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs\n    - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis)\n    - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral\n    - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for “Real Yield” revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO\n    - Support the expansion of Aave markets in “new Frontiers” networks\n4. **Research and Analysis**\n    - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments\n    - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community\n    - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions\n    - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n5. **Team Expansion and Operations**\n    - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better\n    - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure\n    - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement\n    - Start a “Meta-Governance” focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered “Aave-Maximalist,” there’s a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other “professional” delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem.\n6. **Independence & Transparency**\n    - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power.\n   - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol.\n   - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely.\n   - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO.\n\n## **Previous Work**\n\nHere are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative:\n\n- **Governance Coordination**: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly **ZERO** AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022.\n- **AIPs**: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave.\n    \n- **Governance improvement**: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible.\n- **Delegators & contributor coordination:** The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous “co-authorship” synergies with other DAO actors.\n\n## **Requested Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us:\n\n- Sustainably continue our current work\n- Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work\n- Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the “One-Man Army” meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation\n- Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem\n\nBy securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposal's specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal.\nWe commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal. We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to drive the success of the Aave protocol.",

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Linea Testnet\n\n@fig – Flipside Crypto & @DAOstrat.C - Consensys / Linea\n\nDate: 06-23-2023\n\nContact:\n\nGovernance@Consensys.net\n\n-----\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check seeks the community’s input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Linea Testnet and move to Mainnet right after all pre-conditions and dependencies are met on Linea Mainnet. Linea seeks to support Aave’s multichain future while establishing Aave as a leading market on a promising zkEVM with a robust distribution network.\n\n## Background\n\n### About Linea\n\nLinea is a scalable L2 on top of Ethereum powered by a zkEVM tech stack incubated by Consensys, resulting from over 20 months of R&D from Consensys's research team. This team has a track record of successful projects in the zk space, including the GNARK library and active involvement in the Merge. Moreover, Linea is well-connected with developers in the broader ecosystem through existing relationships with MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle. The tech stack that powers Linea aims to support a wide ecosystem extending Ethereum Mainnet capabilities. It intends to align its onboarding and distribution with these products to serve developers, protocols, and builders better.\n\nLinea aims to become a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence, processing native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This approach allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts without needing modifications or re-audit and compatibility at the RPC level with widely adopted middleware and toolsets, providing developers with a familiar environment to build using well-established tools and infrastructure. Linea’s technical value proposition includes the following:\n\n1. ***EVM Equivalence*** - The network avoids transpilers or custom compilers on bytecode, meaning the Ethereum L1 solidity code requires no modification. This significantly reduces deployment costs (no need to re-audit the code) and the risk of bugs and hacks by taking the compiled bytecode directly from Solidity.\n\n2. ***Commitment to Decentralization*** - The Linea team has publicly discussed their intent to decentralize the network within the first 12 months of operation. This includes a state-of-the-art decentralized prover and sequencer structure. Research into these topics is currently underway at Consensys.\n\n3. ***Continual strive for innovation*** - Our priority is pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space while maintaining the highest security and full EVM compatibility. Notably, Linea fully supports EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction), and, in collaboration with key stakeholders, the network already utilizes a single-entry-point contract and hosts top-tier bundlers and paymasters services. Much effort will also be provided to foster human-driven activity by incentivizing projects that leverage attestations and identity ownership.\n\nLinea’s testnet has handled over 2 million transactions under private beta and over 33 million transactions under public beta. Many of these transactions are users of the ongoing Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to help stress-test the network. The network has also shown unprecedented developer activity, with over 4.3 M unique addresses that have deployed more than 1.8M contracts, showcasing a vibrant and engaged developer community.\n\nMore than 100 global partners and protocols are committed to launching on Linea mainnet.\n\n![|548.3761663043992x346.38966281791863](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3SV8rNrgaImVdrUQe477aAfzbcPcw48RlEdxvDjsvBorhicWCEH4IglX-VCtNXSMkqGuaT-VvN1YTyu5BBeFKF7TsHy2fei3rWcfOaTf4HhLw5OrompyE1_BlJtu7iztEVGInOpz_efMakkVy38CJwo)\n\n### Vortex - Lattice-Based SNARKs\n\nLinea's exciting feature is its ability to consolidate transactions and submit proofs to the Ethereum main net using a novel prover mechanism with impressive performance and efficiency. This process increases throughput and reduces transaction fees while maintaining the inherent security of the Ethereum network.\n\nVortex, a cryptographic primitive developed at Consensys, is designed to boost Linea's performance. It employs a new type of zkProof known as a recursive aggregation proof based on Ring-SIS, a fundamental concept in lattice-based cryptography. This proofing system enables transaction batching, which enhances the network's throughput and reduces fees. Linea also uses zk circuits for computations, which aids in secure and efficient calculations.\n\n![Vortex|534x294.4](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HTqoK2NzqeDBXGLj0MT2wieswaN4Fmj_6kGRmJoy8YX1YSPUllMiVMyr-qfbSjWxIAmQsb2rO2qPH2vgNo53eHdGNgNWaDhRs1WBT3eSTETFpi54dWDZqsKMVk9vPfoI3Va_kYY3JbpsT5uhgXGTwhw)\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Market Adoption\n\nLinea allows Aave to leverage the Consensys product suite distribution instantly. Linea prioritizes User Experience (UX), aiming to eliminate barriers for MetaMask's impressive community of 30M MAUs. By securing native support in the default MetaMask network dropdown list, Linea enhances user convenience and fully supports all MetaMask curated experiences. These include On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, the Portfolio dApp, and the MetaMask SDK, presenting numerous opportunities for incorporating the Aave protocol.\n\n![|567.7854671280277x358.33572179744243](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZXbCk4Wp55U6KmwfWtLo0c-s_TYgR7N2fGQeNGYFUGGS10dJcExeO4J1yi4y7nl5bs3ihs0GxXnMzNEg7FknnQvdsuS0e2iV6LuVu4hU0o1uiVAv8PA6Jzs-INGplFb98wUvxKCILlEZmBRsTQuP7JE)\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between Linea and Consensys products, specifically MetaMask, presents clear benefits. MetaMask is pivotal to bootstrapping Linea's activity through simple onboarding, while Linea plays a significant role in supporting MetaMask's future evolution.\n\n### Key Aave Benefits\n\nSome key benefits to Aave regarding the testnet and mainnet deployments include:\n\n1. **Establishment of Aave markets and $GHO on Linea** - Linea's integration with the ConsenSys product suite provides Aave access to a vast and well-established user base that will facilitate distribution and onboarding for the Linea network. This enables smoother distribution and adoption of Aave markets and $GHO. The strategic alignment bolsters Aave's market reach and stimulates fresh opportunities for user engagement, ultimately contributing to Aave's growth and visibility.\n\n2. **Being a Linea Launch Partner** - Consensys is organizing a significant promotion for the Linea mainnet expected in July. This includes marketing initiatives, partner highlights, IRL, and online presence. Aave benefits from these efforts through its testnet deployment and subsequent mainnet approval.\n\n### Aave <> Linea Values Alignment\n\nAAVE and Linea are committed to advancing decentralized systems and fostering innovation in the DeFi space. Both products prioritize growth and development of next-generation applications, with AAVE encouraging innovation in DeFi, and Linea enabling developers and enterprises worldwide to build modern financial infrastructure. Moreover, AAVE's focus on community engagement and investment in startups that add value to the ecosystem echoes Linea and ConsenSys' mission to serve millions of users and support a robust developer community.\n\n### Existing Collaboration Efforts\n\nThe Linea Team successfully conducted a \"First Class Linea Citizen\" campaign, seamlessly incorporating sybil protection into quest activities. This initiative resulted from a collaborative effort between Linea, Aave, and the Lens team to integrate the Lens tech stack into the Linea network.\n\nCreating Lineaster (Lens stack) on the testnet yielded impressive results, with over 257K Lens handles established, accompanied by more than 192K posts, 130K follow actions, and 10K comments. While not directly related to Aave, these results showcase the successful collaborative efforts between Aave-related entities and the Linea team.\n\n### Bridge Security\n\nThe Linea team operates and maintains a canonical Open Messaging Service (OMS), allowing messages to pass to and from Ethereum & Linea. The Ethereum network verifies smart contracts on the L1 that enforce a valid state on Linea. The canonical OMS leverages our zk prover to maintain verifiability.\n\nMoreover, the design implements a trustless relayer and leverages the rollup to maintain state/security. There are plans to secure the bridge (relayer) through decentralization; however, the priority remains on decentralizing the prover and sequencer.\n\nFor a technical walk-through of the cross-chain messaging functionality, please see [Linea Documentation](https://docs.linea.build/developers/use-message-bridge#l1-to-l2).\n\n## Specification [Technical Considerations]\n\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Linea testnet before its mainnet launch.\n\n**Oracles** - While the network is not currently integrated with Chainlink, the integration is expected to be completed shortly after the mainnet. In the meantime, for the testnet phase, Linea will collaborate with Aave to find suitable alternatives. It's important to note that Linea already operates with several Oracle providers, including Redstone and Umbrella.\n\n**Implementation** - The authors of this proposal are committed to working closely with the relevant parties to determine the most suitable asset and market factors for the mainnet proposal. Given that this pertains to a testnet deployment, the asset and market factors will be managed directly through Linea, ensuring an organized and effective execution.\n\n**Governance** - This proposal represents a collaborative effort between the Aave community (specifically Flipside) and Consensys/Linea. This proposal was not sponsored in any way. This ensures transparent, fair, and comprehensive governance procedures that align with the interests of all involved parties.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nLinea nor Consensys has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and Flipside is doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.\n\nAll information provided above is from public sources or from the Linea team directly.\n\nThis TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nFollowing a standard 7-day discussion period, Flipside will work with the community to trigger a Snapshot for a vote for testnet deployment. The Linea team will handle all technical deployment activities. Linea will also engage with necessary parties to complete all required work.\n\nFrom here, we will openly communicate progress with the community and the intended progression when all technical dependencies are met. These activities ensure that Aave can be a Linea launch partner in July.",

The proposal aims to allocate funds to the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) treasury for the next six months, enabling us to actively engage in the Aave ecosystem and contribute to its growth and improvement.\n\n## Abstract:\nif this proposal were to be approved by governance, a stream of the allocated budget would be started to the ACI treasury wallet. It will be used to cover various aspects of the ACI's involvement in the Aave community, including team compensation, community engagement, research and development, infrastructure costs & tooling subscriptions, marketing, and communications.\n\n## Motivation:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been a dedicated contributor to the Aave ecosystem. The 6-Month Budget Proposal aims to secure the necessary resources to continue the ACI's work, ensuring that we can maintain our level of commitment and contribution to the Aave ecosystem. For more details about the ACI proposal, please refers to the [TEMP CHECK version of the current proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344)\n\n## Specification:\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with `treasury.aavechan.eth` (0x57ab7ee15cE5ECacB1aB84EE42D5A9d0d8112922) as the recipient. This will allow the ACI to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 250,000 aUSDT.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is an independent organization focused on contributing to the Aave ecosystem. This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The timeline metrics strongly favor 'YAE' with high early and total lead ratios. Forum sentiment is mixed but leans positive overall, with key concerns about redundancy and budget allocation. Historical similar proposals supporting operational and governance enhancements have succeeded in voting but show mixed market impact, indicating lessons in budget justification and scope clarity.",
