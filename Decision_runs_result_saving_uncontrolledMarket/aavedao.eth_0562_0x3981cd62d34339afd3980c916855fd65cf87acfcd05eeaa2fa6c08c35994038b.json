        "body": "*This proposal is a collaboration between LBS Blockchain Society, Michigan Blockchain (@Michigan_Blockchain), and Flipside Crypto (@fig).*\n\n## ***Simple Summary***\n\nAs Aave grows, there is a need for more advanced features that ensure the privacy and security of participants. Private voting is one such feature that would help to accomplish this goal.\n\nMaking use of [partial private voting](https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-brings-shielded-voting-to-snapshot/) within the Snapshot platform (shielded voting) will enhance Aave’s governance and voters - leading to more fair and accurate results in the Snapshot stage.\n\nShielded voting allows voters to hide their votes during the duration of the voting process and reveal their choices and results after the vote concludes.\n\nWe propose that the community votes to turn on the private voting module for a **two-month trial period**, which can be reverted by the community and Space administrators at any time.\n\nThis allows Aave to judge the efficacy of shielded voting in Snapshot and serve as a leader for Governance in other DAOs in adapting, experimenting, and innovating with new mechanisms.\n\n## ***Motivation***\n\nAave Governance features both on-chain and off-chain voting. In the signal stage, Snapshot, votes have become decided by a few voters without many diversions.\n\nAfter speaking with other delegates, we recognize these outcomes and votes may not always reflect the true wishes of the community; it has become political. An example from Shutter’s blog of how the current process could be political, is below:\n\nConsider a contentious vote in which a minority is pushing the poll early in one direction. Voters that don't have a strong opinion already formed might see this and think the outcome is already decided. Thus, they will be discouraged from voting and also from researching/forming an opinion. This could then lead to the vote going in favor of the minority due to voter apathy, which would not be a good outcome, given that the goal of the poll is to represent the majority opinion.\n\nAave’s Snapshot space must be a place for honesty and candid feedback; without these values, the space becomes redundant and leads to burnout [proposal coming soon.]\n\nBy shielding the individual votes, it encourages voters of different sizes and opinions to participate and feel empowered, leading the DAO toward a more fair outcome.\n\nSnapshot has recently introduced Shielded voting, announced[ here](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o).\n\nShielded voting has four keys benefits:\n\n1. Prevents voter intimidation or coercion\n2. Prevent early voters' decisions from influencing the decisions of later voters, thus reduce herding behavior and encourage independent thinking.\n3. Protects participants' privacy by ensuring that their voting preferences are not exposed\n4. Enhances the overall security and integrity of the Snapshot platform by making it more difficult for bad actors to interfere with the voting process\n\nA [demo](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o) reveals a minimal change in the Snapshot UI:\n\n**![|187x385](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SQiWOD6gYl1albI1OxGJqJE3b1qOdR_ByIVGTVAL7yE-9Q_UBLiZ5ZZM4Cdwl9CuRCPapbBRQD18WwzxA2E46NqVj4B0_HSuyPLObN6nUKjptl6uglUFHBoo8hLEJl7K2w7t8NOcjFo8j00jGb3XB78)** \n\n**![|384x381](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ueaJzNh2PYYb3-FxcCTMOs0KfS-ia33pVv4l2JFiXH6aB2lMmDWZq-pxAcJYDPLgOtEHIwW4ZcGZlISYJBZf0h1yNA443qItFFt4R5u-E28u0iZQpKpuDShgEBC5LaaAsDYaYFNlsOpKgwYkk8myZ3E)**\n\nThis functionality is powered by Shutter Network.\n\n## ***Specification***\n\nThe steps for upgrading a Snapshot space to Shielded voting are as follows:\n\n-> admin of the “Aave” space go to the settings page in the “Voting” section\n\n-> choose Shutter as a privacy option and click “Save”\n\n-> all proposals from then on will use shielded voting.\n\nThe community may disable this feature anytime.\n\nThe current list of Snapshot admins is as follows:\n\n* @monetsupply\n* @MarcZeller \n* 0xc8E0345596D7196941E61D3aB607E57Fe61F85E7\n* 0x2357df661D0E56140dF30c3ad0b2B426fB4666e6\n* 0x60C8dC4762b217b4A00FF1824111077f331B1FbF\n* 0x2D0D6A8553993a3E9eD1D86415358D1EDEfa82F1\n\n## ***Success Criteria***\n\nThe time period the below criteria will be considered over will be 2 months prior to private voting being enabled vs. 2 months from when the time it is enabled.\n\n* Average spread between YES to NO votes\n* Number of unique voters voting\n* Difference between outcomes of the votes, i.e., what % of votes result in YES\n\nFor each of these criteria, success is when the average spread between YES to NO votes reduces, the number of unique voters increases, and there is greater variety in the outcome of the votes. \n\nThese outcomes would indicate increased and more thorough engagement across the community.\n\n## ***References***\n\nThe following comments and replies have been used to inspire this proposal:\n\n[Shielded voting is live! — Snapshot Labs](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o)\n\n[Shutter brings shielded voting to Snapshot](https://blog.shutter.network/shutter-brings-shielded-voting-to-snapshot/)\n\n[Shielded voting demo - Pistachio DAO](https://snapshot.org/#/pistachiodao.eth/proposal/0xa5077ef17097b1d59304b110337bd1c7ce98d95d3ff81d138c3886a80074b4d9)\n\n[Anonymous Voting in DAOs - MIT Research](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2022/projects/Uribe-Hernandez-Jung-Amenewolde.pdf)\n\nWe believe that the implementation of private voting within Snapshot would be a valuable addition to the platform.\n\nWe look forward to working with the Aave community and voters to make it a reality.\n\n## ***Copyright***\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] - Aave V1 Offboarding Plan\n\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative\n\nDate: 2023-03-17\n\n## **Simple Summary**\n\nThis Temperature Check proposes the offboarding of Aave V1 by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on the platform, encouraging users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3.\n\n## **Background**\n\nAave V1 has been frozen since December 2022, and users have been given ample time to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3. As sufficient time has passed, it is now appropriate to move forward with the offboarding process for Aave V1.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAave V1 has served as a pioneering platform in the DeFi ecosystem. However, with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is essential to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. By offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions, we can ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1.\n\n### **New Rate Strategies**\n\nFor each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented:\n\n1. uOptimal: 20%\n2. reserveFactor: 99.9%\n3. base rate: 3%\n4. slope 1: 7%\n5. slope 2: 200%\n\nThese changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to the newer platforms.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal.\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion and finalization of the proposal.\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Summary:\nThis ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation if the following conditions are met:\n\nThe proposal is provided by a risk service provider or has received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\nThe proposed cap change is not greater than a 100% increase of the current cap or the implementation of a cap.\nThe cap is being decreased.\nThe AIP is implementing a FreezeReserve().\nFor other situations, the normal governance process is applicable.\n\nThis framework is intended for All V3 liquidity pools. Relative to freezing reserves, this framework is intended for all Aave pools.\n\n## Motivation:\nSupply and borrow caps are important safety features of Aave V3, and they are essential for maintaining the stability of the platform. However, these caps can also have a significant impact on the growth potential of the platform. If a cap ceiling is met and governance takes too much time to adapt, this can slow down the growth of the platform and limit its ability to meet the needs of its users.\n\nGiven the importance of supply and borrow caps, it is essential to have a governance process in place that can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions. A long-term viable solution would be a clear framework and the election via governance of a Risk Council having a degree of Risk management capability over the Aave protocol. However, while the definition and implementation of this is technically allowed by the Aave codebase, it is still immature.\n\nAs a temporary buffer, this ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation under certain conditions to increase the efficiency of the governance process. By streamlining the governance process in this way, we can ensure that the platform can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions and meet the needs of its users.\n\n## Specification:\nAs there’s no need for on-chain AIP or technical implementation for this ARFC, the outcome of a snapshot vote will be considered canon.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe author of this ARFC, Marc Zeller, is the founder of the Aave Chan Initiative and owns AAVE tokens. However, the ACI is not paid by the Aave Companies nor any other entity to submit this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

By matching the Aave V2 parameters, we aim to encourage migration and ensure a smoother transition for users. This proposal does not suggest any changes to Aave V3 caps or interest rate strategies.\n\n### **Proposed Aave V3 Parameter Changes**\nTo make Aave V3 more attractive for migration and to match Aave V2 parameters, we propose the following changes:\n\n1. Loan-to-Value (LTV): Increase the LTV from 60% to 66%.\n2. Liquidation Threshold (LT): Increase the LT from 70% to 73%.\n3. Liquidation Penalty (LP): Maintain the current LP of 7.5%, as it is already in alignment with Aave V2.\n\nNo changes to Aave V3 caps or interest rate strategies are proposed in this ARFC.\n\n### **Recap Table**\n| Parameter                | Current Aave V3 | Current Aave V2 | Proposed Aave V3 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)      | 60%             | 66%             | 66%              |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT)| 70%             | 73%             | 73%              |\n| Liquidation Penalty (LP)  | 7.5%            | 7.5%            | 7.5%             |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal.\nThis ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~26k AAVE or related assets for a value of approx $2M.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Gather feedback and input from the Aave community and risk service providers on the proposed risk parameters and deployment details.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to update the risk parameters on the Aave V3 Ethereum market.\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Index Coop has compiled the following analysis for Gauntlet and the broader Aave community to review.\n\n# Motivation\nUpdating the AVAX parameters seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n# Specification\nThe criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the AVAX token on Avalanche network is presented below (data as of Jan. 23, 2021):\n\nAVAX Avalanch Market Risk (Coingecko Data)\n\n|Holders:|1.8 m|A|B+|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Transactions (C-chain)|79 m|B+|\n|Mkt Cap|$15 bn|A+|\n|Avg. Volume 1m|$860 m|B+|\n|Avg. Volume 3m|$1.14 bn|B+|\n|Norm. Volatility|6.21%|B-|\n\nThe AVAX token risk score compiled by Index Coop is B+.\n\nHolders are estimated by the cumulative address count.\n\nMarket Cap is calculated using circulating supply.\n\nThe Norm. volatility parameter is the average of the t=30 days and t=90 days as shown in the below table.\n\nAVAX Volatility Data (Coingecko Data)\n\n|Time|S.D. of daily log returns|\n| --- | --- |\n|t=7 days|6.21%|\n|t=30 days|5.54%|\n|t= 90 days|6.88%|\n|t= 180 days|7.80%|\n|t= 365 days|8.81%|\n\n![|464x287](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4zieUXDtgQR2G2iL17gPdh73R_Fh8Wq0ADp99-uRFJ8NIJ7QpQKA-1n01oBQRTeKZKz3M84aeOtaiPTkJlM12-SbBdtbWdMaWETVFjwnGwElBtI0kyjOpz5nc152qhCwTtEPJv6D \"Chart\")\n\nBased upon the volatility data share above, Index Coop suggests changing the Liquidation Threshold and Loan to Value parameters as shown below:\n\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Recommended Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|AVAX Loan to Value|50%|60%|\n|AVAX Liquidation Threshold|65%|70%|\n\n# Implementation\nWe are actively seeking feedback on how to implement this proposal. At this point in time an AIP vote could signal community intent/desire to change the requirements with the changes to be made by the guardians of the Aave Avalanche Market or via the AIP if a permissionless process is in place by that point in time.\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The timeline analysis shows unanimous and stable support for 'YAE'. Forum sentiment is largely positive, with community members endorsing the change while discussing potential trade-offs. Historical adjacent proposals indicate governance adjustments can have varied market impact but underscore the value of stability in governance parameters.",
