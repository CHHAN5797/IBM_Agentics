We will also bribe to gain votes that reward our pools. These bribes will be paid in SHEZMU tokens. Rewards streaming directly to Aura will be paid in either our token SHEZMU, or in shezUSD. shezUSD is Shezmu’s stablecoin that can be borrowed when depositing whitelisted collateral assets on Oasis. You can read more about Shezmu in the description below.\n\nKey Links\n\nWebsite: https://shezmu.io/\n\nDocs: https://shezmu.gitbook.io/shezmu/\n\ndApp: https://shezmu.io/oasis\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/ShezmuTech\n\nGithub: https://github.com/Shezmu-Team\n\nProtocol Description\n\nShezmu is the first hybrid isolated lending market supporting ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 assets. Cross Chain Router DEX & Pioneer of the supply-elastic NFTfi model. Within our lending market, Oasis, users may deposit whitelisted collateral (USDC, PT-ezETH, wstETH, sUSDe, weETH, BAYC, Pudgy, and Shezmu pharaohs) to borrow shezUSD. This allows for various functionality such as increasing NFT liquidity, looping strategies, and various other yield based functionalities, all in one location.\n\nShezmu’s tokenomics involve an elastic supply NFTfi model. The token itself, SHEZMU, has 0% buy tax and 6% sell tax, with the ability to burn tokens in exchange for NFTs, labeled guardians. Guardians are a one of a kind ERC standard stemming from ERC-1155s, making them the first NFT with emissions that are composable and splittable. This allows for functionality within SHEZMU’s ecosystem, such as being borrowed against within Oasis, but also for dollar cost averaging (DCA) in and out of NFTs with fractionalization, allowing for increased liquidity depth and choices for users.\n\nWithin Shezmu, there is also a platform known as Agora, that issues bonds to thicken liquidity. This pays out users in our options token, oSHEZMU, as well as daily ETH distributions to increase PoL. Additionally, Shezmu has a fiat on ramp powered by Ondefy, and a cross-chain dex powered by Axelar. All of this bundled together allows for a hyper-liquid ecosystem with various in and outs for users to enter and exit with various levels of liquidity.\n\nSpecifications\n\nGovernance: Here is a link to the multi-sig wallet for the owner safe:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xA004e4ceDea8497d6f028463e6756a5e6296bAd3\n\nOracles: https://etherscan.io/address/0x32DF1F85eD7804Cb3d67cF8E1678e48D01B439Ff\n\nAudits: Audit conducted by 0xWeisss through Hyacinth can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1GmeMR4WXA4RmsyeipGhdqWfCLVDkikil/view?usp=sharing\n\nCentralization Vectors: We have a small team (under 15 members), with one lead engineer and 5 developers for front and back end development, but both plans and funds are in place to scale as needed. The treasury is currently controlled by the multi-sig wallet.\n\nMarket History: Shezmu launched on September 8th, 2023. Since then, our community has gained over 1800 holders (NFTs + Tokens) and has gained over $250k in TVL. There have been no major volatility events attached to SHEZMU or shezUSD since launch.\n\nPool: https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xed0df9cd16d806e8a523805e53cf0c56e6db4d1d000000000000000000000687\n\nGauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0xA71Adac76A2e34f8F988Fa6992E3bDAd08D92C01\n\nValue: Our goal is to align the majority yield pool with where most users are providing liquidity. If the Balancer pool gains significant popularity within our community and maintains significant APR values, we are highly inclined to back it as the primary liquidity source.\n\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xA71Adac76A2e34f8F988Fa6992E3bDAd08D92C01`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

We will also bribe Hidden Hand for additional votes to reward our pools.\n\nThe bribes will be paid in wETH.\n\nRewards streamed to Aura will be paid in the form of either our reserve-based utility token, VEC, or in the form of psVEC. psVEC is the yield-boosted version of staked VEC (sVEC) that has been wrapped into a Pod on Peapods Finance to deliver increased rewards.\n\nYou can read more about VEC in our Protocol Description below.\n\n**Key Links**\n\nWebsite: https://www.vectorreserve.com/\n\nDocs: https://vector-reserve.gitbook.io/\n\ndApp: https://www.vectorreserve.com/dapp\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vectorreserve\n\nGithub: https://github.com/vectorreserve\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\nvETH is DeFi’s first Liquidity Position Derivative (LPD), introduced by Vector Reserve.\n\nLPDs, or Liquidity Position Derivatives, are a never-before-seen asset class, capturing the yield from various LSTs and LRTs in a diversified fashion - while maximizing the ways to earn yield from each of them.\n\nvETH can be minted using any approved asset on our dApp, and staked to earn yield from the following sources:\n\n1. Staking and Restaking gains from holding LSTs and LRTs\n\n2. LP fees from pairing these assets on various DEXs\n\n3. Upcoming Superfluid Staking: The process of restaking liquidity positions on EigenLayer to earn additional yield. When this feature of EigenLayer goes live, we aim to be the market leader with a large treasury of LST/LRT-based LP positions backing vETH.\n\nThis approach allows us to generate best-in-market yield, giving vETH holders an advantage over holding standard LSTs or LRTs.\n\nOur reserve-based utility token, VEC, has a symbiotic relationship with the vETH token. While vETH generates value for the Vector Reserve, being a great source of treasury revenue, VEC is emitted to generate liquidity for vETH pairs across multiple DEXs - ensuring the product remains competitive in all areas. Every VEC token is backed by assets within the Vector Reserve, which grow from a share of yield generated by vETH as well as LP positions acquired through bonding.\n\nWith over $30m TVL accumulated across vETH and sVEC since launch, Vector Reserve is pioneering the next stage of the liquid restaking revolution.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Balancer vETH/wstETH gauge will play an important early role in incentivising liquidity providers to help with the process of bootstrapping initial liquidity. It will then serve as an important source of liquidity for vETH on an ongoing basis, supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nGovernance: Here is a link to the multisig wallet for the owner safe:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xe0EB63B4E18FF1e646ab7E37510E6EaF287AdE3D\n\nOracles: No external oracles.\n\nAudits: First audit can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/JacoboLansac/audits/blob/main/solo/vector-reserve.md\n\nCentralization Vectors: We have a small engineering team, with one lead engineer, but plans and funds are in place to scale as needed. The treasury is currently controlled by the multisig wallet.\n\nMarket History: Vector Reserve and vETH minting launched on Thursday 25th January 2024. Since then Vector TVL has rapidly accumulated over $30m in TVL. There have been no major volatility events attached to vETH since launch.\n\nValue: We believe in migrating the majority yield pool to wherever the majority of user provided LP is. Therefore, if the Balancer pool proves very popular for our community, it is very likely that we will support it to become the primary source of liquidity.\n\nTechnical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x3ca33F22893a51A80Ed4ed8afebc900Ae813cA02`\n\ngaugeType(string):` Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/788\n\nProposal Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to enable an svETH/wstETH gauge on Balancer at:\n\nhttps://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xdedb11a6a23263469567c2881a9b9f8629ee0041000000000000000000000669\n\nGauge address:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xD98ed0426D18B115d6388923803e33ad8aaF11F8\n\nIncentivization Strategy\n\nWe will adopt a two-pronged incentivization strategy.\n\nWe will directly stream rewards to Aura, so that Balancer LPs can maximize yields. We will also bribe Hidden Hand for additional votes to reward our pools.\n\nThe bribes will be paid in wETH.\n\nRewards streamed to Aura will be paid in the form of either our reserve-based utility token, VEC, or in the form of psVEC. psVEC is the yield-boosted version of staked VEC (sVEC) that has been wrapped into a Pod on Peapods Finance to deliver increased rewards.\n\nYou can read more about VEC in our Protocol Description below.\n\nKey Links\n\nWebsite: https://www.vectorreserve.com/\n\nDocs: https://vector-reserve.gitbook.io/\n\ndApp: https://www.vectorreserve.com/dapp\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vectorreserve\n\nGithub: https://github.com/vectorreserve\n\nProtocol Description\n\nvETH is DeFi’s first Liquidity Position Derivative (LPD), introduced by Vector Reserve.\n\nsvETH is the staked version of vETH, which users receive when they stake their tokens to earn additional rewards.\n\nLPDs, or Liquidity Position Derivatives, are a never-before-seen asset class, capturing the yield from various LSTs and LRTs in a diversified fashion - while maximizing the ways to earn yield from each of them.\n\nvETH can be minted using any approved asset on our dApp, and staked to earn yield from the following sources:\n\n1. Staking and Restaking gains from holding LSTs and LRTs\n\n2. LP fees from pairing these assets on various DEXs\n\n3. Upcoming Superfluid Staking: The process of restaking liquidity positions on EigenLayer to earn additional yield. When this feature of EigenLayer goes live, we aim to be the market leader with a large treasury of LST/LRT-based LP positions backing vETH.\n\nThis approach allows us to generate best-in-market yield, giving vETH holders an advantage over holding standard LSTs or LRTs.\n\nHolders can then stake the vETH on the Vector Reserve dApp to receive svETH and earn additional rewards.\n\nOur reserve-based utility token, VEC, has a symbiotic relationship with the vETH token. While vETH generates value for the Vector Reserve, being a great source of treasury revenue, VEC is emitted to generate liquidity for vETH pairs across multiple DEXs - ensuring the product remains competitive in all areas. Every VEC token is backed by assets within the Vector Reserve, which grow from a share of yield generated by vETH as well as LP positions acquired through bonding.\n\nWith over $30m TVL accumulated across vETH and sVEC since launch, Vector Reserve is pioneering the next stage of the liquid restaking revolution.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Balancer vETH/wstETH gauge will play an important early role in incentivising liquidity providers to help with the process of bootstrapping initial liquidity. It will then serve as an important source of liquidity for svETH on an ongoing basis, supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.\n\nSpecifications\n\nGovernance: Here is a link to the multisig wallet for the owner safe:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xe0EB63B4E18FF1e646ab7E37510E6EaF287AdE3D\n\nOracles: No external oracles.\n\nRate Provider Contract: The rate provider contract for svETH(https://etherscan.io/address/0xad4bFaFAe75ECd3fED5cFad4E4E9847Cd47A1879#readContract) can be seen here. It is currently under review(https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/11) by the Balancer integrations team prior to snapshot voting.\n\nAudits: First audit can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/JacoboLansac/audits/blob/main/solo/vector-reserve.md\n\nSecond audit can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/GeorgeHNTR/portfolio/blob/main/reports/solo/Vector-Reserve-Security-Review.pdf\n\nCentralization Vectors: We have a small engineering team, with one lead engineer, but plans and funds are in place to scale as needed. The treasury is currently controlled by the multisig wallet.\n\nMarket History: Vector Reserve and vETH minting launched along with svETH staking on Thursday 25th January 2024. Since then Vector TVL has rapidly accumulated over $40m in TVL. There have been no major volatility events attached to svETH since launch.\n\nValue: We believe in migrating the majority yield pool to wherever the majority of user provided LP is. Therefore, if the Balancer pool proves very popular for our community, it is very likely that we will support it to become the primary source of liquidity.\n\nTechnical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xD98ed0426D18B115d6388923803e33ad8aaF11F8`\n\ngaugeType(string):` Ethereum`",

Our current synths, baoUSD and baoETH, are backed by ETH based debt positions via our vaults.\n>\n>\n>\n> BaoETH is minted by whitelisted contracts, which currently are “the fed” and “ammFED” (AMO). The Bao multisig has control over which contracts are whitelisted. Changes are approved via governance.\n>\n>\n>\n> The fed mints synths into our borrow vaults, ready to be borrowed against highly liquid & decentralized ETH based collaterals such as wstETH and rETH. Controlling the available supply also affects the variable loan interest rate, helping maintain the peg.\n>\n>\n>\n> The ammFED mints synths directly into balancer liquidity pools containing a backing asset, helping to maintain the peg and profiting from peg deviations.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Bao has made Balancer our primary source of liquidity for our synths. We have recently adapted our strategy to help with volume and participation from liquidity providers, which includes creating new liquidity pools with the most liquid yield bearing assets we can use in stable pools.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n> **Governance:** Bao is governed by the Bao community. Actions voted on are carried out by the community “council of guardians” via its 3/7 multi-sig. This multisig/ council of guardians controls various synth parameters like the mint limit and collaterals.  We plan on using governor bravo or similar in the future to improve decentralization.\n> \n\n> **Oracles:** Chainlink oracles are used to find collateral prices.\n> \n\n> **Audits:** Bao re-uses battle-tested compound, inverse and curve with some changes & has had bug bounties open on immunefi for several years covering all of our live contracts.\n> \n\n> **Centralization vectors:** The 3/7 multisig controls various parameters such as collateral factors, IMF factor (CF factor reduces as loan size increases), liquidation incentive, ability to deposit collateral, price oracle, new collateral additions, mint limits and the ammFED.\n> \n\n> **Market History:** All Bao’s synths have remained closely pegged to their target prices since inception and have robust mechanisms to help stay pegged. The one historically exception to this was a temporary depeg of baoUSD during USDC’s depeg. Since then all synths no longer accept USDC as collateral, relying on decentralized, highly liquid ETH backed tokens like wstETH, rETH and LUSD instead.\n> \n\n> **Value:** Balancer will benefit through trading fees and increased voting incentives for BAL and AURA holders. Bao has a track record of providing vote incentives and building governance power within the Balancer ecosystem.\n>\n\n**baoETH-wstETH:** \n- pool: 0x8296057edb832feac03269e9fce8304ebcbabcaf \n- gauge: 0x001EDF44D8aa79922dBE74f57C703EbCe2E13B43 \n\n **baoETH-rETH:** \n- pool: 0xabc7d08ef73fe3fb67efd900f4471cca788b0899 \n- gauge: 0x80f129622dC60f5A7De85cBc98F7e3a99b09E57f\n\n**baoUSD-sUSDe:** \n- pool: 0x79AF734562f741946566D5126bBDed4Cb699E355\n- gauge: 0xF91BA601c53F831869DA4aCeAAEc11c479413972\n\n **baoUSD-sDAI** \n- pool: 0xC5B3F108024da9776D024fD9CEFa4b48e021f1A2 \n- gauge: 0x17753fC89894A5eBD8b327F7d6121038e9240437\n\n### Technical Specification\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments: gauge(address):`0x001EDF44D8aa79922dBE74f57C703EbCe2E13B43 `\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\ngauge(address):`0x80f129622dC60f5A7De85cBc98F7e3a99b09E57f `\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\ngauge(address):`0xF91BA601c53F831869DA4aCeAAEc11c479413972 `\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\ngauge(address):`0x17753fC89894A5eBD8b327F7d6121038e9240437` \ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
