As sufficient time has passed, it is now appropriate to move forward with the offboarding process for Aave V1.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAave V1 has served as a pioneering platform in the DeFi ecosystem. However, with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is essential to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. By offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions, we can ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1.\n\n### **New Rate Strategies**\n\nFor each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented:\n\n1. uOptimal: 20%\n2. reserveFactor: 99.9%\n3. base rate: 3%\n4. slope 1: 7%\n5. slope 2: 200%\n\nThese changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to the newer platforms.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal.\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion and finalization of the proposal.\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "[TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on Tron\nAuthor: ACI\nDate: 2025-04-18\nSimple Summary\nThis Temp Check seeks the community’s input on the deployment of Aave V3 on Tron Mainnet.\n\nBackground\nTron is the second ranking EVM blockchain in terms of bridged TVL after Ethereum with circa $73bn of value bridged. Almost $69bn of this is stablecoins. We believe that it is time for Aave to deploy on Tron to access this liquidity and allow Tron users to access Aave to earn yield on their stablecoins and borrow against collateral.\n\nMotivation\nAave has deployed on multiple promising new L1 and L2 EVM networks and is often one of the largest protocols on these networks. Tron stands out as a significant opportunity which Aave has previously overlooked, we believe it is time for that to change. It is time for Aave to deploy on the second largest EVM blockchain and allow Aave users the opportunity to access the $69bn of stablecoins and $73bn of bridged value on Tron. This represents a significant opportunity for Aave to grow TVL, revenue, and access a brand new market from which Aave is conspicuously absent.\n\nProof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\nThe Tron DAO has committed to deposit funds at deployment of the instance to bootstrap liquidity.\n\nMore details will be shared at ARFC stage.\n\nSpecification\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Service Providers and this section will be updated at ARFC stage if proposal moves forward, after successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n\nDisclaimer\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The ACI is not directly affiliated with Tron and did not receive any compensation for creating this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], this proposal will be escalated to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

This adjustment aims to enhance capital efficiency and ensure a more effective utilization of liquidity within the Aave protocol.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nCurrently, the optimal usage ratios vary across different Aave instances, reflecting a balance between liquidity utilization and risk management. By increasing the optimal usage ratio for WETH to 90%, higher returns for liquidity providers and improved borrowing conditions for users can be achieved.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe existing optimal usage ratios for WETH across different markets are as shown in the image below and can also be checked in the Aave dashboard [here](https://dash.onaave.com/). \n\n \n![weth optimal ratio.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiherodz64aqwm3oosc5dpymmhplzabnxwkc6sssa46lkrlgxwzhuu)\n    \n\n\nThis proposal will increase WETH Optimal Usage Ratio to 90% on the following markets which are currently at 80%, in order to unify them all:\n\nGnosis V3\n\nPolygon V3\n\nMetis V3\n\nBase V3\n\nAvalanche V3\n\nScroll V3\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

The prospect of becoming a paid delegate has emerged and this publication seeks to define the relationship between delegate and service provider in the context of receiving payment from Aave.\n\nAt the core of the topic, should a Service Provider that offers a Delegation Platform receive additional payment for providing the Delegation Platform service. Similarly, should Delegation Platforms who progress to becoming a service provider continue to receive delegation platform payments. How could Aave remunerate delegates who offer more than governance participation. Are these mutually exclusive payments or is the same entity able to receive payment for being both a delegate and Service Provider.\n\nAs Aave does not offer payment for providing a Delegation Platform, this conversation is pre-empting a future state within the community. By having this conversation now, it will provide clear indication of the communities sentiment to be factored into various contributors future plans whilst not adversley affecting any current contributor. \n\n# Motivation\n\nA quick summary of Delegation Platforms which are either current or proposing to become a Service Provider:\n\n* [ACI Delegation Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-chan-initiative-delegate-platform/10877)\n* [ACI 6 Month Budget](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344/12)\n* [Llama Delegation Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/delegate-to-llama/9043)\n* [Llama <> Aave](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/104/)\n\nAt the time of writing neither of the teams mentioned above are seeking payment for being a delegate.\n\nThere are numerous delegates within the Aave ecosystem which are supportive of delegates receiving payment for the service they are offering Aave. This has been mentioned in the comments on this [thread](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344/6). Through passing conversations and reading over other governance threads, several current delegates are intending or considering contributing to Aave beyond participating in governance decisions. \n\nWith the emergence of the prospect for paid delegation and there already being service proviers with delegations platforms, there is the potential for Aave to provide payment to the same entity for being both Service Provider and Delegate. This publication does not present an opinion, as it affects the author, but seeks to kick start the conversation and will continue to update the post based upon community feedback.\n\nFrom a budget perspective, Aave needs to consider the prospect of remunerating delegates and how this affects service providers with delegation platforms. Similarly, how would Aave reward delegates who provide a service beyond participating in governance. \n\nTo help kick start conversation, a few considerations are shared below:\n\n* Delegation Platforms are providing a service to Aave and therefore should be considered service providers and thus rewarded for there efforts.\n* Service Providers are sufficiently paid and any delegation platform should not receive additional payment.\n* Delegation platforms represent an additional time commitment for Service Providers and should be consider worthy of a separate payment.\n* Delegation Platforms may seek to submit AIPs and spearhead initiatives adding value beyond a voting service. Examples include supporting adoption of GHO and market marking services etc...\n* AGD can be used to provide incremental payments to delegates who perform a service beyond voting participation\n* Should Aave consider a potential voting delegation renumeration construct which recognises registered addresses with voting influence and how active they are within Aave governance. There are several iterations of this across the industry which can researched and tailored to suit Aave. Would this approach include or exclude Service Providers.\n* Delegation Platform may build a material voting base which then enables easier transition to becoming a Service Provider.\n* Service Providers require proposal power to submit AIP and the emergence of delegation platforms may lead to teams loosing proposal power preventing AIPs from being submitted. This may suggest a preference for Aave or stkAAVE holders to separate voting and proposal power delegation.\n\nThe above outlines some considerations for discussion in the comments.\n\n# Voting Options\n\n---\n\n**Option 1 - Delegate Gas Rebate Program**\n\nThis option reflects the proposal outline [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gas-fee-rebate-for-on-chain-votes/12559) and no additional funding outside of this proposal is to be allocated to delegates for governance participating during the next 6 months. After the 6 month window has passed Aave DAO is then able to review this decision. \n\n---\n\n**Option 2 - Incentivised Delegates Program excluding Service Providers**\n\n@Llama shall design an Incentivised Delegate Program, which only recognised delegates are eligible for inclusion within, for the community to review and comment on. This will include a review of existing programs already implemented in the industry, with the a recommended program being published as a TEMP CHECK for the Aave DAO to review and iterate on.\n\nDo note, Service Providers are excluded from receiving economic reward for being a recognised delegate platform.\n\n---\n\n**Option 3 - Incentivised Delegate & Service Providers including Service Providers**\n\nSimilar to Option 2, with the only difference being Service Provider are to receive payment as a Recognised Delegates.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-09-10\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a specific Aave v3 instance in partnership with [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) which will be used for their Earn product using WETH and cdcETH.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) is one of the world’s largest exchanges, currently listed as number 6 on DeFi Llama in terms of total assets. In addition to a large number of global users and partnerships, they have a staked ETH product called cdcETH with over $80m TVL. \n\nThe original [TEMP CHECK proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-cdceth-to-aave-v3-on-ethereum/18259) to onboard cdcETH to the main Aave v3 instance, ended in an abstain result, indicating a desire of the DAO to further explore opportunities at a later time. \n\nAfter discussions with the CDC team, ACI believes there are good synergies in creating a specific instance of Aave v3 that will allow them to integrate their Earn product and create a dedicated location for looping of cdcETH via emode to kickstart the instance liquidity, before including stablecoins to offer more yield options to CDC earn users.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe [Crypto.Com](http://Crypto.Com) Aave v3 instance will target the following:\n\n- We target $35M TVL for the CDC instance at start, with $20M+ on the WETH.\n- Drive liquidity to the new instance with a combination of their CeDeFi Earn product, Wallet integration, 3rd party specialized platforms and CDC-owned liquidity.\n- The [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) team has committed to $1 million worth of incentives for the first 6 months of launch to bootstrap initial liquidity. The ACI is in favor of matching this incentive amount via the Ahab program to increase the adoption velocity of this potential instance.\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n## Useful Links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n\nIssuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\nDeFi Llama: [https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth 2](https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth)\n\nCoingecko: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth 1](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth)\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: [Crypto Staking — Crypto.com | Earn up to 16.64% per year by staking with us](https://crypto.com/staking)\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: [Liquid Staking | Crypto.com Help Center](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Crypto.com and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage.\n3.
