The Aurus Foundation performs KYC / KYB / AML - to ensure that only verified actors can provide the highest quality metals to the Aurus ecosystem. These metals are verified, audited and stored with top tier 3rd party custodians, in locations like: London, Zurich, Madrid.\n\nThe below pools are intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the Aurus ecosystem and subsequent RWA Alliance partners, driving the majority of traded volume to Balancer.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\nPools: \n\nTXAU:USDC\n**https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x98f9220f128eed5e853cd3d23a2c33e1f98f8311000200000000000000000e55**\n\nTXAG:USDC\n**https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x31ac27805b0665695071b640bf2abfbe0736c02e000200000000000000000e56**\n\nTXAU:TXAG:WETH\n**https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x418681127fb0c4fb5ee01202fbe4ab8c8f4eb84a000100000000000000000e59**\n\nTXAU:USDC Polygon Root Gauge: **https://etherscan.io/address/0x5787A5bADC53663F3f039C5fcA68b5f3DAba56A9**\n\nTXAG:USDC Polygon Root Gauge:\n**https://etherscan.io/address/0xa532f5AAFB0B268D873443d621521ee0EEb8a6d3**\n\nTXAU:TXAG:WETH Polygon Root Gauge:\n**https://etherscan.io/address/0xDa993d62510043602DE20487E8ff409552724f0C**\n\nWebsite: **https://aurus.io/**\nTwitter: **https://twitter.com/AurusOfficial**\nDeposit/Withdraw/Swap: Xave: https://app.xave.finance/#/pool/ \n(switch to Polygon network)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nXave Finance (pronounced “Save Finance”) is scaling stablecoin markets (any kind of stablecoin backed by currencies, commodities, on-chain synthetic, anything tokenized or tracking market pricing from off chain etc) by building its’ “FXPool” used by stablecoin issuer partners Aurus (http://aurus.io/), StraitsX (https://straitsx.com/), Stasis (https://stasis.net/), Circle (https://circle.com/), VNX (https://vnx.io/), and others covering EUR, CHF, Gold, Silver, USD, SGD, IDR, BRL and more.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe Aurus Foundation is registered in the UK and received legal passing via direct & ongoing consultation with the FCA on all Aurus tokens. The Foundation facilitates the tokenization of tGOLD ($TXAU) and tSILVER ($TXAG) commodity tokens, on behalf of precious metal providers, like Gold Refineries. One such partner is Sempsa JP refinery in Spain, which has been operating for more than 100 years and is part of the broader Heimerle Meule Group of companies. \nAurus, Sempsa JP refinery & Xave Finance are together pioneering an alliance of liquidity partners in web3, particularly focused on Real World Assets. The RWA Liquidity Alliance will enable many top projects and companies to acquire tGOLD and tSILVER to diversify their treasuries. In order to join the Alliance, members need to first add a minimum of 50% of their tGOLD &/or tSILVER paired with USDC as LP on Xave / Balancer. Alliance members then qualify to redeem or sell their metals directly with Sempsa refinery too, via a White Glove service. This provides another source of “off-chain” liquidity for them, which should encourage “stickier liquidity” on-chain for the long term.\n\nTogether we will be helping to build further use cases for this pool to enable liquid Gold and Silver FX trades globally. Aurus is developing a use case for Gold-backed digital collectibles, where the FXPools will benefit, as the tGOLD tokens used to “back/collateralise” the collectibles will be sourced from the pools.\nThere is a high probability that the RWA narrative continues to gather strength too, which will provide further opportunities and should lead to increased demand. Xave and Aurus are also currently developing partnerships with key distribution partners in India and Turkey, two countries with extremely high demand for Gold. This would connect their users / traders directly to the tGOLD & tSILVER FXPools, driving further volume.\n\nThese real world use cases will bring sustainable fee generation via real economic activity to the DAO. Xave and Aurus would like to work with the community to incentivize the TXAU:USDC & TXAG:USDC Polygon FXPools, as well as the TXAU:TXAG:WETH Polygon pool with BAL rewards. Working together to build more real world use cases and further growth and distribution of Gold & Silver in DeFi.\nFurthermore, Aurus is in talks with all RWA partners to create new pairs with their own project tokens and pair them with TXAU, as well as provide allocations of their own tokens for future LP incentives on Xave / Balancer. With the help of BAL rewards, we aim to scale to $1M TVL in each pool through onboarding new alliance members and through community members of all projects and Aurus partners. With a total target of $3M TVL over the next 6-12 months. \n\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. Governance:\nGovernance will be done via snapshot for now. Later on Xave’s own VE governance structure will be deployed (forked from veBAL). Current admin of the TXAU:USDC & TXAG:USDC Polygon FXPools is the team’s ops 2/3 multisig 0xC76Ec28801ad09020fB89da48306176e56960CC5 (Polygon), until the community is ready to take on ownership of the Xave protocol.\nThe TXAU:TXAG:WETH Polygon pool is deployed directly on Balancer v2.\n\n2. Oracles:\nThe TXAU:USDC & TXAG:USDC FXPools utilise a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve. Beyond this range (called the “beta region”), LP ratio then dictates the price of trades. At this point, arbitrageurs are incentivized by significantly cheaper fees to trade the pool back to the “beta region” where FX price is followed. LPs are also incentivized to keep liquidity in the pool especially while it is outside the “beta region”, due to existing parameters that yield much higher fees charged to traders swapping the pool away from the “beta region”.\nThe TXAU:TXAG:WETH Polygon pool does not use oracles as it is deployed directly on Balancer v2.\n\n3. Audits:\n[v2 Final Audit - Xave Finance](https://docs.xave.finance/contract-audits/v2-final-audit)\n\n4. Centralization vectors:\n2/3 operations multisig that owns contracts until contracts are “battle tested” and community is ready to takeover\n\n5. Tokens:\nThe Aurus Foundation, registered in the UK and received legal passing via direct & ongoing consultation with the FCA, facilitates the tokenization of tGOLD ($TXAU) and tSILVER ($TXAG) commodity tokens, on behalf of precious metal providers, like Gold Refineries. Each token is backed 1:1 with fully allocated LBMA Gold or Silver. Where each metal token equals 1 gram of the underlying physical metal.\n\n6. Value:\nThe pools consist of the tGOLD ($TXAU) and tSILVER ($TXAG) commodity tokens, where tokenization is facilitated by the Aurus Foundation, on behalf of regulated precious metals providers like Sempsa JP refinery. Who will concentrate liquidity for real world use cases dependent on capital efficient on-chain FX, to support the multiple use cases for Gold and Silver across web3, as discussed above.\nThese pools are intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the Aurus ecosystem and subsequent Alliance partners, routing all trades via these pools, and hence the majority of traded volume.\n\n#### Technical Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x5787A5bADC53663F3f039C5fcA68b5f3DAba56A9`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon`\n\ngauge(address): `0xa532f5AAFB0B268D873443d621521ee0EEb8a6d3`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon`\n\ngauge(address): `0xDa993d62510043602DE20487E8ff409552724f0C`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon`",

Every GBPT token is fully FIAT backed by 1 GBP in our bank account.\n\nOur vision is to enable both retail consumers and financial institutions to leverage the power of GBP within the DeFi space and beyond. We are looking to Balancer as a great entry point into the arena and are excited to be offering exclusive incentives for those looking to help PoundToken in this initial distribution phase.\n\nPoundToken is planning to set up a GBPT:USDC FX Pool that will enable liquidity providers to earn BAL Emissions as well as a starting 2% yield on all GBPT that is provisioned into the pool.\n\n# **References/Useful links**\n\nLinks:\n\n* Website\n  * https://poundtoken.io/\n* Twitter (X)\n  * https://twitter.com/Poundtoken\n* Token\n  * https://etherscan.io/token/0x86b4dbe5d203e634a12364c0e428fa242a3fba98\n* Audits\n  * https://resources.poundtoken.io/tech-audits/\n* Attestations\n  * https://resources.poundtoken.io/reports/attestations/\n* Proof Of Reserve\n  * https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/reserves/gbpt-por\n* CEX\n  * https://www.gate.io/price/poundtoken-gbpt\n* Contract Address\n  * https://etherscan.io/address/0xC58150838855a5605C9030398c6D22afd5Bb09EE\n* Pool\n* Gauge w/ 2% Cap: [0xc5e66bB9fE27b7Cef4B64557Ad8398437730DD33](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5e66bB9fE27b7Cef4B64557Ad8398437730DD33#readContract)\n  * https://app.xave.co/#/pool\n\n# **Protocol Description**\n\nPoundToken has primarily been used OTC and listed on CEXs such as gate.io. We are now however looking to leverage Xave’s FXPool to enable an accurate stablecoin exchange between GBPT & USDC for the Balancer DAO and its community.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nPoundToken will continue to build use cases for this pool to encourage more liquid FX trades. We are looking to distribute GBPT further into the Ethereum ecosystem while at the same time starting to scale out our offering to multiple L2s so that we can issue natively on them.\n\nA great use case we are already exploring is enabling local UK based companies that are typically taking payments or receiving investments in USDC right now to be able to swap into GBPT to reduce their FX exposure. This pool would play a pivotal role in enabling this.\n\n# **Specifications**\n\n1. **Governance:** \nGovernance of the pool will be done via snapshot for now.\n\n2. **Oracles:**\nBy leveraging Xave’s FXPools the GBPT:USDC pair will utilize a Chainlink oracle to allow FX accurate swaps for a predetermined range of the bonding curve.

The owner of the pool will be changed to the Balancer recommended address 0xbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalbalb once the pool has been running for sometime without issue to allow for quick response time in the event of an emergency. Until then the Xave operations multisig will be assigned as the pool’s owner.\n\n5. **Market History:** \nGBPT is an asset backed stablecoin, fully collateralized and issued by BlackFridge - the licensed issuer of fiat backed stablecoin GBPT. USDC is an asset backed stablecoin issued by Circle\n\n6. **Value:**\nFXPools deployed on Xave are highly capital efficient allowing for the pool to support larger trade volumes despite the minimal liquidity.\n\n**Specification**: \n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xc5e66bB9fE27b7Cef4B64557Ad8398437730DD33`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/693\n\n**Summary:**\n> Balancer's core focus has been yield bearing liquidity for quite some time. As of recent [sDAI](https://app.spark.fi/sdai/) and [sFRAX](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake) have become popular yield bearing stablecoins in the greater defi ecosystem. This proposal is meant to enable four gauges encompassing these tokens on Ethereum and Arbitrum in stable and weighted pools. The pool will sufficiently capture which captures the yield of these tokens and creates routing for the 3 primary stablecoins and wstETH to be swapped against. The pools all will be core for Balancer.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Maker Webiste](https://makerdao.com/en/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/dai/dsr-manager-docs/dsr-manager-docs.md)    \n    • [Communities](https://forum.makerdao.com/)\n> Link to: \n    • [Frax Webiste](https://app.frax.finance/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/src/types/constants.ts)    \n    • [Communities](https://gov.frax.finance/)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sDAI is part of the Maker ecosystem and utilizes the Dai Savings Rate to incentivize users to stake their DAI here https://app.spark.fi/sdai/ . \n>\n>sFRAX is from the new Frax v3 ecosystem and can be utilized [here](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake). \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer users will have a more capital efficient place to provide stable coin liquidity routes. As core pools these will receive BAL incentives over time via the BIP-19 cycle. sDAI and sFRAX will overall earn the DAO more revenue and strengthen the routing for swaps on Balancer using the underlying tokens.  \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module). Frax governance is outlined [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-governance/frax-governance-overview). \n\n2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on the [SavingsDAIRateProvider](https://0xc7177B6E18c1Abd725F5b75792e5F7A3bA5DBC2c) to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/SavingsDAIRateProvider.md). The sFRAX and wstETH oracles utilize the Chainlink feed factory or have been proven by being utilized for over a year on the platform. \n\n3. **Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits). \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n5. **Market History:** sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai). sFRAX history can be seen [here](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xfef79304c80a694dfd9e603d624567d470e1a0e7?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults). \n \n6. **Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin and wstETH liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and sFRAX.\n\nsDAI/3Pool - Mainnet\nPool: [0x49cbD67651fbabCE12d1df18499896ec87BEf46f](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x49cbd67651fbabce12d1df18499896ec87bef46f00000000000000000000064a)\nGauge: [0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4)\n\nsDAI/wstETH - Mainnet\nPool: [0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf1](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf100020000000000000000064b)\nGauge: [0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108)\n\nsFRAX/4POOL - Arbitrum \nPool: [0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27#readContract)\nChild: [0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd)\nRoot: [0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83](https://etherscan.io/address/0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83)\n\nsFRAX/wstETH - Arbitrum\nPool:  [0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f160](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f1600002000000000000000004de)\nChild: [0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653)\nRoot: [0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nThe pool will have the `core pool` status as per BIP-457",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/521\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis proposal enables a Gyroscope gauge for a R/sDAI Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP) on Ethereum Mainnet. The pool will be seeded with liquidity in the 0.9 - 1.001 range and two other pools with liquidity in the 0.95 - 1.001 and 0.98 - 1.001 range will follow soon. By deploying these new pools, users will be able to trade between R and sDAI at extremely low price impact in the 0.9 - 1.001 R/sDAI range. The deployment of this pool builds upon the release of the Peg Stability Module (PSM), aimed at stabilizing the R peg and providing a source of yield for R Savings Module depositors through the accumulation of sDAI.\n\n**Protocol description**\n\nRaft is a DeFi protocol that lets you generate $R, a leading decentralized USD stablecoin, by opening a CDP (collateralized debt position), or by depositing stablecoins into the Raft protocol reserve.R is backed by high quality collateral assets such as[ stETH](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth) (Lido Staked Ether) and[ rETH](https://stake.rocketpool.net/) (Rocket Pool ETH) and reserve assets such as[ CHAI](https://chai.money/), the yield-bearing version of the DAI stablecoin. R aims to be the stablecoin of choice within the decentralized ecosystem, with deep liquidity across many trading pairs, a high yield, and a stable peg. As more use cases for $R develop, users will be able to spend, swap, and earn with $R. Users will also be able to leverage up to 6x on different LSD tokens in a single atomic transaction.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe R/sDAI pool on Gyroscope is a natural progression from the PSM, offering swaps from R to sDAI with the best price impact conditions compared to other uniform liquidity pools. The pool will receive incentives that will be distributed based on the PSM's ongoing usage and the development of the R peg over time. Liquidity providers in such pool will benefit from earning the DAI Savings Rate and from being depositors in the most capital efficient pool where to trade R.\n\nThe pool will have 5 bps swap fees, an amplification coefficient of 700 and a 10 bps upper price bound that enables the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n1. Governance: The Raft governance model focuses on being efficient, transparent, and community-driven, while maintaining a governance-minimized approach. The governance model will be strengthened further by the launch of a native token that confers governance power to its holders.\n\n2. Oracles: The pools rely on price feeds from Chainlink and Tellor\n\n3. Audits: Raft is audited by Trail of Bits and Hats Finance\n\n4. Market History: Raft was launched on June 5th 2023 and has attracted approx $65m TVL at its peak. The Raft team has worked with the Balancer community to launch two successful pools (see $R here, the R/DAI pool on Balancer[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x20a61b948e33879ce7f23e535cc7baa3bc66c5a9000000000000000000000555) and R/wstETH pool[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x380aabe019ed2a9c2d632b51eddd30fd804d0fad0002000000000000000005547c47f942beea)) . We would like to continue working within the Balancer ecosystem going forward.\n\n5. Value: The R/DAI pool deployed on Balancer has been among the top 5 pools on Balancer by trading volume in the last few weeks, exceeding $ 1 mln daily trading volume. We expect the R/sDAI pool on Gyroscope to generate a consistent amount of volume due to the capital efficiency embedded in the concentrated liquidity model and in the choice of pairing R with a yield-bearing asset like sDAI\n\n**Centralization vectors**\n\n1. Liquidations are permissionless (anybody can liquidate)\n2. The key parts of the Raft protocol are immutable\n3. The Liquidity Committee includes 3 Raft team members. More to be added in the future as the Raft governance evolves\n\n\n**References / useful links**\n\n· Website: [https://raft.fi/ ](https://raft.fi/)\n\n· Documentation: https://docs.raft.fi/\n\n· Twitter: https://twitter.com/raft_fi\n\n· Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/raft-fi)\n\n· GitHub: [Raft · GitHub](https://github.com/raft-fi/) \n\n**Audits**\n\nRaft’s smart contracts have been audited twice:\n\n1.

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/918\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Optimism, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Optimism: 0x2218a117083f5B482B0bB821d27056Ba9c04b1D3\n\nsDAI/aUSDC Optimism pool on Gyro: [Gyroscope Protocol](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/optimism/e-clp/0x876e0a21626c33bdab879330505eccc6091aa607/)\n\nChild chain gauge: [[Vyper_contract | Address 0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340 | OP Mainnet Etherscan ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340)]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf\n\ngaugeType(string): Optimism",
