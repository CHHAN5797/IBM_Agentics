This journey began with a complete UI and UX overhaul via the ZEN interface, reached a significant milestone with the launch of CoWAMM—a novel solution for LVR mitigation—and now culminates in Balancer v3, a comprehensive reengineering of the platform’s underlying technology.\n\nAs outlined by Fernando, in his post on the [protocol's future](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801), Balancer v3 strategically focuses on key priorities such as fungible liquidity, stablecoins, long-tail, and yield-bearing liquidity, and introduces new customizable options for extending existing pool types through hooks.\n\nAlongside these technical advancements, Balancer v3 provides a unique opportunity to refine the protocol’s core mechanics, particularly its fee structure and pool framework—critical elements for long-term DAO sustainability. The following temperature check proposes adjustments to the fee model and core pool framework, set to take effect with the release of Balancer v3.\n\n# Simplifying the Protocol Fee Model\n\n## Fee Model on Balancer v3\n\nThe development of custom pools provides the DAO with a unique opportunity to integrate innovative pool types and advanced mechanisms for fee accrual and redistribution.\n\nCurrently, a significant portion of Balancer v2's revenue is derived from a specialized fee-capture system on liquidity pools hosting yield-bearing assets like Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Reward Tokens (LRTs). With the launch of 100% Boosted Pools in v3, this established yield-capture advantage will be extended, allowing revenue generation from vanilla, non-yield-bearing tokens by deploying them into yield-generating markets. This approach enables any token with an external yield market to be composed and “transformed” into a yield-bearing asset, unlocking new revenue streams for the DAO \\- **a system that no other DEX in DeFi has**.\n\nAlthough the technology has demonstrated its product-market fit for yield-bearing liquidity, the existing 50% yield-capture fee has faced resistance from LST protocols and liquidity providers, limiting the DAO’s ability to capture this market segment fully. Given the critical role of yield capture in revenue generation, the DAO must reassess the current fee model to remain competitive and dominate this market.\n\nThus, our strategic focus for v3 centers on accelerating the adoption of boosted pools and solidifying the DAO’s position within the LST and LRT market. Additionally, we aim to drive continuous product innovation to continue to unlock unique revenue streams through hooks and custom pool logic.\n\nTo support this, we propose implementing two key changes:\n\n1. Reducing yield fees to 10% to increase adoption of yield-bearing liquidity on Balancer v3  \n2. Strengthening veBAL holder benefits with a simplified fee model[^5]\n\nThe veBAL system and BAL token emissions, being immutably established in Balancer v2, will continue utilizing the core pool framework and gauge system. This ensures alignment between token emissions and performance while maintaining veBAL's long-term relevance. Importantly, veBAL holders will benefit from concurrent revenue streams from both v2 and v3.\n\n**Fee Structure Overview:**\n\n* 10% fees on yield-bearing asset yields  \n* 50% on collected swap fees\n\n**Pool Classifications:**\n\n* Core pools: as per new revised core pool framework  \n* Non-core pools: All other pools\n\n**Fee Distribution:**\n\n* Core pools: 70% voting incentives[^6], 12.5% veBAL, 17.5% DAO  \n* Non-core pools: 82.5% veBAL, 17.5% DAO\n\n \n![bip-734-1.png](ipfs://bafkreia3hmaxolni5kvj5kgryxa7jbaz7xoeqmprpeyq2huqnlktxscyay)\n    \n\nThis model achieves three key objectives:\n\n1. Streamline veBAL holder benefits through an 82.5% total fee share  \n2. Aligns BAL emissions with high-performing pools  \n3. Maintains sustainable DAO SP (service provider) funding and operations at 17.5% fee share.\n\n## Modified Fee Model on Balancer v2\n\nBalancer v2's success as a governance token, and LST / Yield Bearing liquidity hub in 2023-2024 informs our approach to fee model optimization. While preserving the core framework's integrity, we're proposing targeted adjustments to align with v3's launch:\n\n* Maintaining current fee rates: 50% yield fees, 50% swap fees  \n* Updating non-core pool fee distribution:  \n  * Previous: Redirected 50% of fees to voting incentives  \n  * New: 82.5% to veBAL, 17.5% to DAO  \n* Updating core pool fee distribution to be in line with v3:  \n  * 70% as voting incentives, 12.5% to veBAL, 17.5% to DAO\n\nThis modification serves to:\n\n* Sustain momentum in successful core pools  \n* Direct swap volume success to veBAL holders  \n* Encourage v3 migration through lower yield fees (10% on v3 vs 50% on v2)\n\n## Revised Core Pool Framework\n\nFor a pool to be eligible for core pool status, certain criteria must be met. We propose to make it more clear what will be a core pool in the future:\n\n### Composition requirements\n\n* Minimum 50% yield-bearing or boosted tokens for pool types such as weighted or composable stable pools  \n* 80/20 weighted pools that utilize Balancer as their primarily liquidity hub (e.g. RDNT:WETH 80/20 pool on Arbitrum). Protocols need to apply to core pool status for such pool types[^7]  \n* Must maintain a minimum $100k TVL\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n* No yield fee exemption  \n* Fee settings delegated to Balancer governance  \n* If no protocol fee settings are present or managed by another entity, the pool can only become core pool if an alternative protocol fee setting is setup in place[^8]\n\n### Token Requirements\n\n* All tokens must have verified smart contracts  \n* No tokens with transfer restrictions or rebasing mechanics\n\n### Core Pool list maintenance\n\n* Core pool status is evaluated on a bi-weekly basis before fee sweeps by automated checks managed by Balancer Maxis \\[5\\]  \n* New pool types or compositions not described within this framework need governance approval to be added to the core pool list  \n* The DAO shall review this framework and propose adjustments through DAO governance\n\n## \n\n## Impact of Fee Change\n\nBased on the proposed fee changes, we have conducted [backtesting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dx82Hqcw53AwnXOkY3CFSJMshojjT7BzlsKf3zQa-FQ/edit?gid=759201376#gid=759201376) on v2 data and ran simulations to assess the potential impact of v3 adoption.\n\n### Balancer v2\n\nThe revised fee model adjustments to Balancer v2 would result in the following change in fee distribution to key stakeholders:\n\n* veBAL: increase of 46.7% of revenue share compared to the current model  \n* Voting incentives (to veBAL and vlAURA holders): 30.3% decrease  \n* DAO: no change\n\n \n![bip-734-2.png](ipfs://bafkreidvw3kwpd2kuvxti7yagbpfphiauagdgeqbvb7b2vl22r776ns6ji)\n    \n*Monthly fee distribution on v2: actual vs proposed (average of August, September and October 2024\\)*\n\n### Balancer v3\n\nWhile the reduction of yield fees from 50% to 10% in v3 represents a significant change, our analysis \\[1\\] demonstrates how optimized yield fee utilization will maintain robust protocol revenue. We conducted detailed simulations using 5 out of our top 10 pools by TVL, focusing on two key pool categories[^9]:\n\n1. Stable USD vs boosted stable pools on v3  \n2. Composable stable LST/LRT vs Aave or Morpho boosted pools\n\n \n![bip-734-3.png](ipfs://bafkreicxn2ivsa5txihwy7k7voxrj5bpr3wd2pzmlu2ykwz2n3o2d2ualy)\n    \n*Monthly income to liquidity providers comparing Balancer v2 vs v3*\n\n \n![bip-734-4.png](ipfs://bafkreiesnlfsj7gtn2tef44j2xvyaltt6qsvj7o45rfqfwruvkvprnxjse)\n    \n*Monthly yield fees to the fee collector*\n\nKey Findings:\n\n* LPs will experience a 407% increase in income from boosted yield and reduced yield fees  \n* Protocol yield fee revenue maintains 56% of current levels even with reduced yield fees  \n* Enhanced yield capture from new boosted stable pools effectively compensates for most of the yield fee reduction to 10% assuming the same TVL levels\n\nThis analysis shows that while yield fees are decreasing, the protocol's ability to capture and optimize yield fees through new pool types ensures sustainable revenue generation. The 407% increase in LP yield income demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategic shift toward yield optimization.\n\n## Launch timeline\n\nThe proposed Balancer v3 deployment schedule:\n\n* Q4 2024: Initial launch on Mainnet and Gnosis chain with strategic pool selection  \n* Q1 2025: veBAL gauge system activation with new fee model implementation  \n* Q1-Q2 2025: Multi-chain expansion phase\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nA detailed technical specification execution plan will be posted as a separate BIP outlining the modified fee collection mechanism on v2 and the implementation for v3 in early 2025\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe launch of Balancer v3 marks a strategic evolution in the protocol’s development. It brings significant enhancements to custom pool creation and extends the flexibility of proven pool types while preserving the strong foundation and market leadership established with v2.\n\nBy refining the yield fee capture structure and streamlining core functionality, v3 is poised to deepen yield-bearing liquidity, boost returns for liquidity providers, increase benefits for veBAL holders, and foster sustainable long-term growth for the protocol.\n\nThis proposal strikes a balance between innovation and stability, setting the stage for Balancer’s continued leadership in DeFi infrastructure. We invite the community to support these enhancements as we embark on this exciting new chapter in Balancer’s journey.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1\\] [Fee distribution modeling](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dx82Hqcw53AwnXOkY3CFSJMshojjT7BzlsKf3zQa-FQ/edit?gid=759201376#gid=759201376)  \n\\[2\\] [Balancer v2 core pool framework](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/partner-onboarding/balancer-v2/core-pools.html)  \n\\[3\\] [Historical core pool dashboard](https://balancer.defilytica.com/#/corePools)  \n\\[4\\] [Protocol Fee Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/balancer/protocol-fees)  \n\\[5\\] Balancer v2: [Automatic core pool list](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/4cebcb436926c7c0098563f7b562d40f13494b95/outputs/core_pools.json#L2)\n\n[^1]:  As with v2 yield fee can be set to be exempt.

        "title": "[BIP-362] Restructure the Joint Balancer / Beethoven X Deployment on Optimism",
        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "Authors: Beethoven X contributors (composers and music directors)\n\nThis proposal presents an opportunity to position Balancer and Aura as the leading forces of technology on Optimism. It aims to seize the upcoming launch of Aura to leverage cross-chain Balancer boosts, restructures the network's liquidity, and propel Balancer, Beethoven X, and Aura toward increased market dominance. This proposal seeks to do so by proposing a modified protocol fee structure and core pool framework, similar to other successful Balancer deployments.\n\n**Background and Motivation**\n\nOptimism's bedrock upgrade has transformed the Superchain thesis into reality. With the impending Base Launch and the continuous development of the OP stack, we believe Optimism is poised to attract greater attention and liquidity. With the launch of Aura, these developments present an opportunity to cement the joint Balancer and Beethoven X deployment as a core technology and liquidity host on the network.\n\nSince the approval of the Beethoven X friendly fork of Balancer in November 2021, the partnership between the two protocols has flourished into a truly unique relationship. Nowhere else in DeFi has a fork become an essential SP of the original protocol. For the last year, we have recognized we are stronger when we work together, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve and building a better ecosystem along the way. If we look back, the joint Optimism deployment was the pivotal milestone in the expanding relationship between these two protocols. \n\nSince its launch in July 2022, the joint Balancer and Beethoven X Optimism deployment has demonstrated its innovative prowess, becoming the primary host of LST liquidity, amassing $60 million in TVL in April 2023, and generating approximately $370k in protocol revenue. While these metrics are indeed commendable, there is room for improvement. With the recent emergence of L2 veBAL Boost powered by LayerZero, there is the opportunity to leverage the impending launch of Aura and make considerable improvements to network market share. \n\nThis proposal seeks to optimize the current incentive structure to coincide with Aura's launch. Specifically, it aims to restructure the distribution of protocol fees to bootstrap an enhanced liquidity flywheel on the network and adopt a modified Balancer core pool model per BIP-19, supplemented by Beethoven X’s Optimism grant.\n\n**Current Protocol Fee Distribution**\n\nIn line with other Balancer deployments, the joint Balancer/Beethoven X deployment currently allocates 50% of swap fees and yield capture as protocol fees, with the remaining portion directed towards LPs. Based on initial governance approvals, both DAOs agreed to a [50](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xd281d8cad43c97814b2496270498c4396b16c0f2ce522d5bc554aae9fed4e4d7) / [50](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x2856e059b7bf581ee97ce63b36d79d85c3f27910ec5c79115de3d0d9fadc948c) split of the protocol fees as part of the joint deployment.\n\nBeethovenX's governance adopted an [additional proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x94ca4387a061af6df49ce3fefd9439e7399e7af152c59b56b370a43705eed4c1), where it committed to allocate 50% of its share of the protocol fees, converted to OP, matched with Beethoven X's OP grant, and emitted to pools as liquidity mining or gauge incentives. In certain instances when positive ROI was achieved, these incentives were directed towards Hidden Hand's OP vlAURA gauge market, but have more often been used as direct liquidity incentives.\n\nBeethoven X's grant-matching approach is a sustainable incentive model designed for long-term success. Other partnerships, such as Rocket Pool, have played a pivotal role in bootstrapping liquidity by directing their OP grants toward Optimism pools. However, the joint deployment has faced limitations in competing with the incentives provided by other protocols due to the number of incentives the joint deployment can currently emit based on the portion of protocol revenue flowing to Beethoven X.\n\n**The Value of Optimism Deployment**\n\nFrom January 1 to June 30, 2023, approximately $77.8k in BAL rewards have been emitted to OP pools through veBAL, while Balancer's revenue share directed towards the DAO treasury amounted to approximately $125.5k, resulting in a positive net cash flow. During the same period, Beethoven X incentivized pools with $56.6k worth of BEETS tokens, recycling half ($62.8k) as incentives from its share of protocol fees matched with OP.\n\nWith the anticipated launch of Aura and cross-chain veBAL boosts, Beethoven X, Balancer, and Aura will unlock more efficient means to foster liquidity growth. Historically, Aura has provided the Balancer ecosystem with an additional liquidity layer enabling efficient vote markets. As such, Beethoven X's current OP grant matching program can shift to being deployed as gauge vote incentives to direct BAL and AURA emissions to increase protocol TVL efficiently. If voting market efficiencies reduce, the incentive program can continue to emit direct liquidity mining incentives on pools. Aura has also [proposed an OP grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-28011280168279695) that would direct additional direct LP incentives or match bounties placed on any Aura voting markets with OP.\n\nBy leveraging the cross-chain veBAL boost and providing an efficient liquidity layer, combined with potential OP matching, Aura is a growth catalyst for the Balancer and Beethoven X deployment. With these additional optimizations to our incentive systems, we can ensure that our entire ecosystem substantially increases market share and revenue potential on Optimism.\n\n**Core Pool Framework**\n\nThe Balancer Core Pool Framework implemented through [BIP-19](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc), allows us to designate certain pools as \"core pools.\" Under this framework, protocol fees earned on other Balancer L2 deployments are utilized as gauge incentives for core pools on those networks, accelerating the adoption of L2s within the Balancer Ecosystem. BIP-19 was approved to collect and allocate 65% of the fees of all pools and proportionately direct them as gauge incentives to each L2's core pools to bootstrap their liquidity.\n\nGauge Framework v1, as proposed in [BIP-57](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-57-introduce-gauge-framework-v1/3604), introduced rating criteria for the Balancer community to evaluate all current and future veBAL gauges. This framework incorporates an \"overall\" factor, derived from the \"weight\" factor and \"market cap\" factor, as well as a \"revenue\" factor. It imposes a 2% cap, 10% cap, or no cap to gauges.\n\nBIPs-19 and 57 have also been applied to designate at least two 80/20 pools, Radiant and Alchemix, as uncapped core pools, in lieu of receiving ve80/20 grants\n\nThis proposal aims to adopt these frameworks for the Balancer/Beethoven X deployment on Optimism. However, we propose a modification to the distribution system: Rather than distributing incentives between core pools based on TVL, we propose incentives are distributed based on protocol fees generated by each pool, a calculation that can be efficiently derived using the [Beethoven X dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c).\n\n**Specification**\n\nThis proposal seeks to ensure that we bootstrap the launch of Aura in the most efficient way possible with two changes.\n\n1. Adopting a modified version of Balancer’s protocol fee distribution\n2. Establishing an Optimism core pool framework\n\n**Adopting Modified Version of Balancer’s Protocol Fee Distribution.**\n\nWe propose the joint Beethoven X / Balancer deployment on Optimism adopts the same 65/35 Protocol Fee distribution structure as other Balancer deployments: 65% of the fees used as incentives on the vote market for Optimism pools, and 35% goes to DAOs, with an equal split between Beethoven X and Balancer. \n\nIf approved, this action would take place as soon as possible to capitalize on Aura’s launch on the network. 65% of the fees would be utilized to buy OP and direct OP as voting incentives for core pools. The resulting action would see 65% of all protocol fees paired with OP from the Beethoven-X/Balancer OP grant, meaning a net 130% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives. \n\nThere is also the potential for further matching from Aura’s OP grant request. If Aura’s OP grant is also approved, this would see a net 260% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives for vlAura voters while the grants are active. Voters will see an increase in voting incentives that go towards pools of Optimism with the potential to increase even further with every voting cycle due to the positive flywheel effect.\n\nProtocol fees are currently collected every two weeks with all fees sent to the Beethoven X Treasury on Optimism automatically. Balancer DAOs share is then bridged to the Balancer Treasury on Mainnet. The proposal aims to keep this procedure to streamline the process of OP grant matching, with OP directed towards voting incentives for vlAura voters, or as direct Liquidity mining incentives depending on voting efficiencies. \n\n**Adapting the Core Pool Framework for Optimism**\n\nThe Optimism deployment will adhere to the Balancer Core Pool Framework that is in place for all other chains. However, we propose to add a slight change to the distribution mechanism: Instead of distributing the voting incentives based on the TVL of the pools, we propose to distribute incentives based on fees (yield and swap fees) generated over the previous two weeks. Beethoven-X has developed a [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c) that details a pool's contribution to fees and the resulting incentive distribution those pools will receive. While distributing incentives based on TVL is a good approximation, using fees as the underlying data is more accurate.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following existing pools would be designated as core pools:\n\n* Rocket Fuel (reth/eth metastable)\n* Shanghai Shakedown (wsteth/eth metastable)\n* Tri-Sonne Harmonic Crescendo (bb-so-wbtc/bb-so-wsteth/bb-so-usdc weighted pool)\n* Gyroscope ECLP (wstETH/WETH)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n* For this BIP to become active, Aura must launch on Optimism, which is planned very soon.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nVia redirecting a portion of Balancer's protocol fees to voting incentives for veBAL / vlAURA voters, the net percentage of protocol fees flowing to the Balancer DAO treasury as well as Beethoven X DAO treasury will be reduced to 17.5%.\n\nWhile this reduces potential future treasury runway, it also has the potential to bootstrap the TVL of pools that contribute considerably to revenue. Paired with a cross-chain Balancer boost, Aura’s Liquidity mining boost, incentives, possible Aura OP matching, and potentially positive ROI on voting markets, yield-bearing core pools will have the potential to see a considerable increase in TVL. To add to this, these pools are unique in that an increase in TVL directly correlates to the revenue generated.",

The deployment further positions Balancer to take advantage of Base’s growing adoption and aim to become a foundational DeFi protocol within the Base ecosystem.\n\n## Introduction\n\nBase is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) rollup built on the Optimism OP Stack, designed to offer low-cost, high-throughput, and secure transactions. Base has emerged as a leading L2 with $3.5b in TVL.\n\nBase benefits from its connection to Coinbase, offering unique opportunities for user onboarding, fiat-to-crypto bridges, and access to millions of Coinbase users.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\n### Motivations\n\n1. **Access to Base’s Rapidly Growing Ecosystem**: Deploying Balancer v3 on Base will position it within a burgeoning L2 network with a strong and rapidly expanding user base. Base’s adoption has been catalyzed by its integration with Coinbase’s extensive ecosystem, providing a gateway for millions of new users to explore DeFi and potentially Balancer.\n2. **Enhanced Liquidity Opportunities**: Balancer v3’s flexible AMM framework will enable efficient liquidity provisioning on Base, supporting the growth of existing dApps and fostering the development of new DeFi primitives. Balancer v3’s unique features, such as Boosted Pools, align perfectly with the diverse asset needs within the Base ecosystem.\n3. **Continued Product Innovation:** Deploying v3 on Base enables products such as QuantAMM to launch on Base as well. Gyroscope boosted ECLPs also become possible, and new ideas such as @mikeb’s [priority fee taxing](https://t.co/6RmoREjoj3) can be leveraged by v3.\n4. **Utilize existing v3 integrations**: Both AAVE and Morpho are available on Base and can immediately be leveraged for boosted pools.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis proposal asks the Balancer community to authorize the deployment of Balancer v3 on the Base Network.\n\n## Timeline and Next Steps\n\nSnapshot would go live this round. Expected deployment by end of January.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDeploying Balancer v3 on Base presents a beneficial opportunity to expand both ecosystems. Balancer can establish itself as a foundational DeFi protocol on a rapidly growing L2, while Base gains an additional liquidity solution to enhance its DeFi ecosystem.",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to gather Balancer community support and approval for Solace DAO to launch and operate a new Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora chain, an EVM within the NEAR ecosystem. This newly deployed protocol will be called Holdr, with the governance token HLDR, and ultimately governed by Holdr DAO.\n\n# Abstract\n\nIf approved, this proposal will result in:\n\n- Solace DAO launching Holdr as an officially recognized Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora\n- Balancer DAO Treasury receiving 4% of HLDR total supply\n- BAL tokenholders receiving 1% of HLDR total supply\n- Solace DAO and Balancer DAO research and co-marketing collaboration\n\n# Preface\n\nThis proposal is shared by Solace’s team and was written by Nikita Buzov (founder). Solace has received a grant of $20,000-worth of AURORA tokens from Aurora to pursue this proposal and launch a Balancer V2 friendly fork. Also, back in summer 2021, Solace DAO has also received a NEAR grant worth of $30,000 from NEAR Foundation to develop Solace, a DeFi Insurance protocol (live across Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Aurora). Therefore, Solace has been well supported and integrated within the NEAR ecosystem community, which, along with successful experience operating DeFi protocols, makes Solace team a natural partner within the Aurora’s and NEAR’s ecosystems.\n\n# Motivation\n\nBoth NEAR and Aurora ecosystems have been steadily growing and developing their unique technology. Over the years they have shown a strong commitment to innovation and user experience, developer community, as well as security! Because of this continued growth, Solace is excited to support their ecosystem and, together with Aurora, identified a need for Balancer V2 technology to become present there.\n\n# Background\n\nSolace is a DeFi insurance protocol, founded back in 2020 and first launched in 2021 on Ethereum, later expanding to Polygon, Fantom, and Aurora. Over the past years Solace team has been awarded grants from Polygon, Aave, NEAR, Celer, and Aurora, following successful completion of the specified goals. Additionally Solace DAO has been funded through a seed round in 2021 (raised $1.1M). The team has displayed over time a great track-record of shipping products, developing and setting up complex architectures, operating protocols on multiple chains. Solace’s team is currently composed of 10 people: 5 engineers, 1 UI/UX designer, 2 BD & marketing, 1 operations, 1 founder (also an engineer).\n\n# Specification\n\nSolace is set to launch Balancer V2 fork in the most current production deployment, including all the core technology. With security in mind, Solace will not make any changes or updates (unless explicitly requested by Balancer DAO, or an emergency response to a verified vulnerability is required) to the core smart contracts. This work has been complete and the contracts are live in production. I invite you to check and verify both the application and the deployed contracts following these links:\n\n- Website (access the app through the link on there): https://holdr.fi/\n- Smart contracts: [https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses](https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses)\n\nPlease note that LBP UI and the Bribe market functionality are still in development, but should be completed in the following weeks, ahead of the HLDR token launch (tentatively scheduled for December'22).\n\nHoldr will also follow the exact same governance process and tokenomics design as veBAL, locking 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR BPT with a max period of 1 year to control the HLDR liquidity mining emissions across gauges.\n\n# HLDR Supply and Distribution\n\nThe total supply of HLDR will be 100,000,000 HLDR tokens and distributed through the following allocations and schedules:\n\n## 5% - Balancer\n\nA portion of the Holdr protocol should be owned by both the Balancer’s treasury and BAL holders. This would be following a standard set by a previous Balancer friendly fork, Beethoven X. We propose, in a similar fashion, that 5% of the total supply of HLDR should be allocated as follows:\n\n- 4% provided to the Balancer DAO Treasury (2y linear vesting, 6mo cliff).\n- 1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows:\n    - A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders\n    - Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible\n    - A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders, including the holders of veBAL locking their BPTs, on Ethereum\n    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL/ETH 60/40 BPT holders\n    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, USDC/MATIC/WETH/BAL 25/25/25/25 BPT, and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders.\n\nTo achieve a more equitable distribution of the airdrop tokens, they will be distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value of the holdings. Note, any qualifying address will need to have a Holdr LP position, worth at least $100, staked in incentivized liquidity mining. A snapshot date will be announced within a month after the launch, if this vote is passes. The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined collaboratively between the Solace team and the Balancer community and the requirements outlined here are subject to small revisions.\n\n## 15% - Solace DAO\n\nThis allocation will be awarded across Solace DAO, Solace Launch DAO, and the active team members to compensate for the on-going work and to support Holdr protocol operations. The distribution will happen on a 2 year linear vesting schedule with a 6-month cliff.\n\n## 15% - Holdr DAO Treasury\n\nThe Holdr DAO will be formed overtime by the community and will inherit this treasury to govern and financially support any future developments, grants, contributor compensations, etc. Solace team’s goal over the next couple of years will be to pass on the governance as the Holdr DAO matures. This treasury will be be vesting linearly for 5 years, with a 1-year cliff.\n\n## 14.125% - Ecosystem Partners & Investors\n\nThis allocations will be utilized to effectively partner with various protocols within NEAR and Aurora ecosystems, as well as to raise some capital to finance any operational costs. Vesting will follow a linear schedule of 2 years, with a 6-month cliff, similar to the Balancer DAO and Solace DAO allocation.\n\n## 2% - HLDR Liquidity Bootstrapping\n\nThese funds will be used to seed and launch HLDR token using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool.\n\n## 48.875% - Liquidity Mining Emissions\n\nSimilar to Balancer’s schedule, Holdr will adopt emissions halving every 4 years. The initial emissions rate will start at 150,000 HLDR/wk.\n\n# Friendly Fork Agreement\n\nIf accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title with a one-month notice period. If such decision passes a vote, Balancer DAO will loose claim to all unvested HLDR tokens granted to their DAO Treasury.",
