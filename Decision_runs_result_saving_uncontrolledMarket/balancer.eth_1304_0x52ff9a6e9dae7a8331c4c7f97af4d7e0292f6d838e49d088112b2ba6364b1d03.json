        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/819\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Balancer DAO has locked its vested AURA into vlAURA with [[BIP-481]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-481-claim-and-lock-balancer-dao-aura-allocation-into-vlaura/5319). The first lock of 1.42m AURA will expire and can be relocked after March 7th and before the unlolck date of March 14th, 2024:\n\n \n![bip-551.png](ipfs://bafkreigqscbntq3fhxjxnaicwwfro3tn7zzntkhpp4ecec25bd7c5z3bfi)\n    \n\nThe DAO wishes to relock its current position and bundle it with an additional vest so the next unlock is bundled into one in 16 weeks from the relock date.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Balancer DAO wishes to relock its vlAURA position to continue to vote for Balancer gauges with its position. To do so the DAO needs to relock its expired position timely after March 7th and before March 14th 2024\n\nAt the time of writing, the DAO is entitled again to roughly ~280k AURA tokens (can be verified by calling `available` with `_recipient` as `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422 ). Another ~297k AURA remains unvested and will be claimed at a later date.\n\nWe are proposing to initiate another lock with the available ~280k AURA to be used to vote on AURA governance. The specifics of the Balancer DAOs voting allocations can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419).\n\nBy re-locking the initial position and vesting additional AURA between March 7th and March 14th which would fall into the same locking epoch, it is guaranteed that the entirety of the locks will be up for re-lock in 16 weeks, reducing load on the multi-sig, streamlining the management of this position.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the vlAURA contract at `0x3fa73f1e5d8a792c80f426fc8f84fbf7ce9bbcac` and call `processExpiredLocks` with argument `true` - The execution needs to be timed AFTER March 7th and BEFORE March 14th\n\nAdditionally, the DAO multisig on mainnet `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call the `claim` function on the AuraVestedEscrow at `0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422` with the parameter `_lock` set to `true`. This execution, as well as the above, needs to be timed AFTER March 7th and BEFORE March 14th",

We are proposing to lock this into vlAura to begin earning rewards and eventually start allocating vote weight towards revenue generating or strategically important pools that lack a proper means of bootstrapping without ecosystem stakeholders voting philanthropically.  A proposal for how the DAO will deal with allocating this vlAura voting power will be presented in the coming weeks, but we think it is prudent to initiate the locking now. \n\n**Specification**: \n\nThe DAO multisig on mainnet 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will call the claim() function on the AuraVestedEscrow at 0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422 with the parameter _lock set to true.",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/916\n\nOverview\n\nOriginally when BeethovenX was approved as a friendly fork 10 million BEETS was set aside for the DAO to unlock via a vest. This can be seen here in the original vote. https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc to receive 4% of the total supply, 250M tokens, which can be confirmed in BEETS [tokenomics](https://docs.beets.fi/beets/tokenomics). The purpose of this proposal is to update the fantom wallet responsible for this vesting contract with the maxis as signers. The maxis will then claim the fully vested balance of BEETS, and transfer it to the DAO Multisig on Optimism. This is to make the bridging process streamlined. For the time being this will consolidate the multisigs utilized by the DAO as fantom is a relatively inactive network. There is no plan to utilize the BEETS tokens in any way for the time being, but an additional proposal can be made to do so at a later time.\n\nThe current DAO Multisig on Fantom will not be utilized after these actions unless absolutely necessary after this proposal. The likelihood of it's use is incredibly low due to the networks activity, and Balancer's influence in the Fantom ecosystem.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe DAO Multisig ftm: `0xFe2022da08d17ac8388F5bEFE4F71456255105A4` will call `addOwnerWithThreshold` on itself six times, with the `threshold` equal to `6` and the following new `owner` addresses:\n\n`0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17`\n`0xafFC70b81D54F229A5F50ec07e2c76D2AAAD07Ae`\n`0xc4591c41e01a7a654B5427f39Bbd1dEe5bD45D1D`\n`0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516`\n`0x11761c7b08287d9489CD84C04DF6852F5C07107b`\n`0xcf4fF1e03830D692F52EB094c52A5A6A2181Ab3F`\n\nThese can be confirmed via [bal_addresses](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/4396ca6ee46272111bb6db65e5054af079e58dda/extras/signers.json#L2)\n\nThe DAO Multisig ftm: `0xFe2022da08d17ac8388F5bEFE4F71456255105A4` will then interact with the vesting contract `0x8D381EC09356C3F1805c54B2BB0867e8b417DC3a` calling `release` with the BEETS token address `0xF24Bcf4d1e507740041C9cFd2DddB29585aDCe1e` as the `token` argument. \n\nOnce the BEETS is received it will sent to the Maxi Multisig until further notice by calling `transfer` on `ftm:0xF24Bcf4d1e507740041C9cFd2DddB29585aDCe1e` with the recipient as `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e` and amount `10000000000000000000000000`",

By passing a `max(uint128)` we claim all available tokens\n- `Airdrop1.claimVestedTokensViaModule`: idem, but claim pending tokens from the vesting created during the initial airdrop\n\nThis results in two transfers to the multisig totalling to roughly 2000 $SAFE.",

        "body": "# Payload with PR\n\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/920\n\n\n# Abstract\n\n\n[GIP-64](https://snapshot.org/#/gnosis.eth/proposal/0xd9dbc0cebba7b9a27f6fa3f30987b89b4dd50140ee3e21624ebc9bdb16049654) prompted GnosisDAO to distribute an additional portion of the SAFE supply, aimed at promoting decentralisation on the Gnosis Chain. In the context of a [token swap agreement](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x8d4969e56fa8eb13abc7a3404b3d42fe6b4afa1c7f29111bd012314f093a2fd2), Balancer DAO received GNO tokens from GnosisDAO, which were then locked in the [LGNO locking contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4f8ad938eba0cd19155a835f617317a6e788c868). This deposit qualifies the Balancer DAO for these additional benefits, as it satisfies the requirement of having \"GNO in locking contracts on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.\" The current proposal aims to claim 119,196.473 Safe tokens, receiving them in the  [Balancer DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f).\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThe DAO Multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ```0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f``` will interact with the SAFE contract at ```0x20cF5bA8aBA68Cd7Ca3d0cAfAc54dA807c772418``` and write the claim function for the total amount allocated, passing \n  \n```\"0xe3f30724dc7b68f4dc7bef54b812e18454d9b9b278887f4f09de5ee8dd2fbb97\"```                                        ,                                                                                      ```\"0x403b039b300b5d3f14f5a95011807ad1f279c31b5c6668e9dad1cbd43d5d9271\"```                                         ,                                                 ```\"0x25ddc11367cfc9aeab1086adcc396ffdaeb90e491021ab488fcacd43037cd4e6\"```                                        ,                                                                                                  ```\"0xc2628e8800f0dbbce626dcf83c09a30a5a97d79413dcb79ca32a75d3cc1e66b8\"```                                        ,\n```\"0x933f0c6611414cc50cc739051a4e8140ca04f4ca6113746cedf8e9174aa9a6df\"]```\n\nfor the ```merkleProof``` argument, and ```119196472786989781864064``` for the ```amountAllocated``` argument.",
