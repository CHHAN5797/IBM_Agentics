        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Polygon v2 to v3 Liquidity Migration \nAuthor: TokenLogic @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2023-03-18\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nTokenLogic presents an opportunity to help kick start the migration from v2 to v3 by capitalising on the favourable conditions presented by the imminent multi-token liquidity mining program on the Polygon v3 market.\n\n# Abstract\n\nOn Polygon, there are two Aave deployments in production and the majority of the liquidity is deposited into the obsolete v2 deployment. With Chainlink expected to monetise oracles, v2 partially frozen and several communities about to distribute rewards on v3, this publication seeks to further encourage the migration of users from v2 to v3.\n\nWith SD, LDO, stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be flowing across the v3 deployment imminently, Aave is presented with an incredibly unique set of conditions that offer an ideal opportunity for further encouraging the onboarding of users onto the v3 deployment. The lion share of TVL on Polygon v2 could be migrated with simple changes presented within.\n\nThis publication provides initial parameter changes supportive of encouraging the migration of funds without putting any users' positions at risk of liquidation. Users with debt positions are encouraged to migrate to reduce borrowing costs and users with deposits are encouraged to migrate to receive a higher deposit rate.\n\nThis initiative is open for discussion and will be changed to reflect the evolving discussion in the comments section below. The key consideration here is the oversized upside realized by acting early during the liquidity mining campaign.  \n\n# Motivation\n\nIn recent months, Llama’s has coordinated across several teams to bring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and rewards to the Polygon v3 deployment. Stader Labs is currently distributing SD rewards, with Lido DAO and Polygon Foundation expected to commence distributing LDO, MaticX and stMATIC rewards in the very near future. Next week, cough.\n\nNormally, with rewards being distributed across the Aave v3 deployment, usage and therefore deposit rates are expected to increase. However, on this occasion, incentives are not expected to be applied to stable coin deposits and the higher deposit rate on stable coins will need to be demand driven. \n\nCurrently, Aave v2 offers higher deposit rates and higher borrowing rates on 2 of 3 major stable coins. Table 1 below compares the three main stable coins. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoyNytW.png)\n\nFor stable coin deposit rates to increase on v3, the liquidity mining will be reliant on wMATIC, stMATIC and MaticX deposits being used as collateral to borrow stable coins. With this approach to liquidity mining, some demand for borrowing stable coins is expected on v3, but it is not certain and it creates the need for further action from the Aave community to encourage migration.\n\nThis proposed upgrade, coinciding with the lucrative incentive campaign on v3, is intended to further encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by reducing the v2 deployments capital efficiency. V2 will remain very much functional and supportive of communities to migrate to v3 on their timeline. \n\nFor reserves where the utilization is less than the Uoptimal value, this proposal seeks to update the Uoptimal parameter to be the midpoint between current utilization and Uoptimal value. This will lead to higher borrowing costs, estimated to be around 35% higher (borrow interest 2.37% to 2.96%) on average for the main stable coins, and if the RF is not adjusted, will lead to higher deposit rates. By increasing the RF, from 10% to around 30%, the additional interest that would have been received by depositors will be redirected to Aave’s Collector Contract. As a result, deposit rates will not meaningfully change on v2 and borrow rates increase.\n\nIf/when the liquidity mining on v3 leads to higher borrowing cost, if no action is taken on v2, v2 will offer the lowest borrowing rates. For assets like wETH, BTC and AAVE being used as collateral to borrow stable coins there will be no incentive to migrate to v3. By increasing borrowing rates on v2, the v3 deployment will remain more competitive when utilization on comparable reserves are similar, see Table 2. In fact, the v3 deployment can have higher utilization and still offer a lower cost of capital which gives v3 a competitive advantage over v2, see Table 3.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/csUT2wP.png)\n\nIf just the RF was increased on v2, then deposit rates on v2 would reduce and borrowing which is already slightly more expensive relative to v3 would remain unchanged, thus providing no additional incentive for borrowers to migrate. This is especially true for those that have deposited wMATIC, wETH or wBTC and borrowed stable coins. Thus the need to increase borrowing costs on v2 relative to v3.\n\nBy decreasing the Uoptimal value, the capital efficiency of the reserves is reduced and with each redemption/deposit (removal of liquidity) the borrowing rate will be more sensitive as the gradient of the first portion of the interest rate curve is slightly steeper. Each larger redemption, withdrawal of liquidity, will cause borrow rates to increase that bit more than otherwise which continues to encourage migration over time.\n\nTo continually adjust the Uoptimal lower would be a rather aggressive approach towards migrating users. Until the timeline around when Chainlink intends to begin charging for oracles, future changes may focus on reducing the deposit rate by adjusting the RF over time. For frozen assets, adjusting the RF appears to be the most effective way forward as it was shown to be successful when applied to FEI.\n\nAs rewards being distributed on Aave v3 are finite (bear market) and for a limited amount of time (3 months), the time to initiate the migration from v2 to v3 is now. With any luck, the rewards will lead to a lot of funds migrating and this proposal then ensures v2 offers higher borrow costs relative to v3 which further encourages migration. There is a risk here that the borrow cost increase proposed in this proposal is too subtle. However, this is not intended to be a mass migration push proposal but instead a smaller change that compliments the v3 liquidity mining program to Aave benefit. \n\nFollow up proposals can further adjust Upotimal values once utilization on reserves like USDT have reverted back to more normal conditions.\n\n### Uoptimal Parameter\n\nThis publication splits the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal values. Ie: If utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%, the midpoint between the existing utilization and Uoptimal value.\n\n### Slope 2 Parameter\n\nBy reducing the Uoptimal parameter, the gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100% is lowered. In order to maintain the current gradient, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher. In the image below, Slope 2 changes from 75% to 150% in response to the Uoptimal parameter being reduced from 80% to 60%. Notice how the red and blue lines are parallel during the second leg of the curve, this is because they have the same gradient. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ojX6SLn.png)\n\n### Reserve Factor\n\nAs a portion of the interest paid by borrowers is directed to users who provide liquidity, by increasing the borrow rate, the deposit rate also increases assuming the reserves utilization remains unchanged. To counter the higher deposit rate, which encourages more deposits, the RF is increased.  This redirects  interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors. The table in the Specification section outlines how each RF is adjusted to keep the deposit rate mostly unchanged despite the higher borrow rates. \n\nDue to abnormally high USDT usage, 84.51% at the time of writing, this proposal suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs. The justification for this is to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, such that it encourages migration whilst avoiding reducing the Uoptimal such that borrowing cost increases substantially by shifting utilizing onto the more stepper portion of the yield curve. When utilization drops by a material amount, it would be prudent to reduce the Uoptiomal value in line with other stable coins. \n\n# Specification\n\nTable 4 below presents the current asset configuration on Polygon v2.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/An2aWJq.png)\n\nBased upon the methodology presented above, Table 5 details the parameter changes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2gqgoQr.png)\n\nDo note, the parameters to be changed have been rounded to nearest whole number and no Uoptimal was increased.\n\nPior to any AIP submission the numbers should be updated in line with the strategy to avoid any un-favourable parameter configurations. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nCommunity discussion, whereby any service provider or contributor can elect to work with the author on the implementation. The main intent here is for Aave to make the most of the rewards distribution programs that are about to add to Stader Lab’s existing reward program.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if a risk service provider could confirm the above will not adversely affect users, which hopefully will resonate with delegates within the community.\n\nThe key with this proposal is time, as rewards on v3 will last only a finite amount of time. The author believes the changes presented here within, thought of as a one-off, or opportunistic, will lead to the migration of the majority of most liquidity. The liquidity mining campaign coordinated by Llama should be capitalized upon. \n\n# Disclosoure\n\nTokenLogic is publishing this proposal as the scope falls outside of Llama’s core role within the Aave ecosystem, that said, at TokenLogic we are more than happy for any contributor to progress this proposal. There are no payments to TokenLogic, direct or indirect, relating to this forum post. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @scottincrypto\nDated: 2022-12-17 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend BAL interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3 and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere is currently a high demand for borrowing BAL (interest rate = 28.18% on Polygon v3) across all Reserves. The BAL liquidity pools offer poor capital efficiency, with the utilization of the Reserve ([48.27%](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x9a71012b13ca4d3d0cdc72a177df3ef03b0e76a3&marketName=proto_polygon_v3) on Polygon v3) often near the Optimal point of 45%.\n\nBy changing the interest rate curve across all three active Liquidity Pools, this proposal is expected to improve capital efficiency by lowering interest rates on markets where borrowing is disabled and enticing capital to move to where borrowing demand generates an attractive yield. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and generate significant capital efficiency within the BAL Reserves.\n\nDue to the ongoing incentives offered by Aura Finance, any new deposits are expected to be borrowed. Users are able to borrow and deposit BAL into [Aura Finance’s staking contract](https://app.aura.finance/) to earn a yield of around 45% at the time of writing. This creates an arbitrage opportunity of 16.82% taking into account the liquidation risk, auraBAL peg and additional Smart Contract risk.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUsers are expected to continue borrowing BAL to earn yield whilst interest rates permit and, in doing so, will create ongoing borrowing demand for BAL. Changing the interest rate curve by amending the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will improve the capital efficiency of Reserves. However, with borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it is rational for profit driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield.\n\nThe three charts below show the most recent 5 month historical BAL interest rate across each BAL Reserve. The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 28.18% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14% which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pyLdQvS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6sNc6ku.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eAG1lOG.png)\n\nIn addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at 0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a BAL interest rate similar to the SNX interest rate curve which has a base 3%, slope 1 12% and slope 2 100%.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b3kks7y.png)\n\nUtilization of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 73.33% assuming users can borrow BAL and are willing to pay an interest rate of 13%, which is less than the current borrowing rate of 28.18%. With a borrowing cost of 14% at the Optimal point, depositing BAL into Aura Finance’s auraBAL staking contract or B-80BAL-20wETH / auraBAL gauge will remain lucrative for users. If the utilization exceeds the Uoptimal point, a follow up proposal will propose increasing the interest rate further.\n\nThe improved capital efficiency of the BAL Reserve is expected to lead to an increase in BAL liquidity on-chain. The more on-chain liquidity there is, the more expensive it is to manipulate an oracle feed. Based upon the @ChaosLabs Borrow Cap formula, Llama proposes increasing the Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 from  96,798.00 units to 256,140.00 units.\n\nWith respect to the Polygon v3 deployment, assuming the BAL Reserve remains at $979,230, the revenue generated at the Optimal point for the DAO will increase from $6.17k to $20.4k, or 230%. The Reserve utilization increases from 45% to 80%, which reduces the amount of unused BAL by 63.6%. This will provide a significant increase in capital efficiency.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the BAL Interest Rate on Ethereum v2, Polygon v2 and Polygon v3.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nThe below shows the proposed changes to the Borrow Cap on Polygon v3.\n\n|Polygon Parameter| Units |\n| --- | --- | \n| Supply Cap | 284,600 (no change)|\n| Borrow Cap | 256,140 |\n\nBorrow Cap is calculated: \n(Uoptimal + 0.1) x SupplyCap\n(0.8+0.1) x 284,600 = 256,140\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0\\(https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2022-12-17\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1]. As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode.\n\nThis proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens.\n\nUtilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 72.5%. At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAO’s revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost.\n\nIncreasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300%. Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility.\n\nThe breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative.\n\nThe capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3].\n\nBased upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65%. It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65%. The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZloZ51jG8cSo9pK37apk9xqwSnyM2T6WwKWEaimSNA8sVpcxxsRrQBYPf9F6DAFMzXPdlhRWwNePF_5kZrTEoZu8-rfk3CmDtTivdrrwTTQGrAe-ZoZ1to1PlsAaFfbkmQLeRdOAy0qukls3wJAXFgKgCA6TUd6jP2w6mbO4WWKOguI0RjWEQ7BkIg \"Chart\")\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the wMATIC Reserve.\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n|---|---|---|\n|Uoptimal|45%|75%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|6.1%|\n|Slope2|300%|100%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|20%|\n|Supply Cap|32.88M|47M|\n|Borrow Cap|9.23M|39.95M|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx\n[3] https://lido.fi/\n[4] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [4].",

This proposal will focus on revising the AVAX interest rate parameters with the goal of improving the capital efficiency of the wAVAX reserve and increasing Aave’s wAVAX revenue.\n\nWith a revised higher SupplyCap on sAVAX, we expect this to lead to an increase in the adoption of the recursive yield strategy. Increasing the availability of wAVAX supports the growth in TVL and revenue accruing to Aave with the sAVAX SupplyCap becoming the primary means limiting the adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLlama has been in discussions with various parties to develop a yield curve that supports adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX on Avalanche v3. The strategy is modelled to be attractive whilst the utilisation of the wAVAX reserve is less than the Uoptimal point.\n\nInterest Rate at the Uoptimal point is calculated as shown below.\n\nBase + Slope1 = 70% x (LST Yield + sAVAX Deposit Incentives / 2) / ( 98% x sAVAX eMode LTV)\n\nBase + Slope1 = 70% x (7.2% + 0.41% / 2) / (98% x 92.5%)) = 4.72%\n\nThis approach reflects the following considerations:\n\n* Deposit rewards on sAVAX significantly affect the profitability of the strategy by offsetting wAVAX borrowing costs\n  * Yield earned is sAVAX yield (7.2%) + deposit incentives (0.41%)\n* sAVAX deposit rewards are diluted with more deposits, ie: 50% growth in sAVAX deposits.\n* Recursive strategy operates narrowly within the LTV of sAVAX eMode TVL\n  * 98% of the 92.5% LTV via Avax Correlated eMode\n* Recursive strategy is only attractive whilst generate supportive risk adjusted yield\n  * Looping 6 times generates around double the LST yield at Uoptimal utilisation, this is how the 70% figure is derived. This does not takes into consideration leverage transaction costs which could lead up to 1.5% of the principle and incur a 2-3 week break even period. It is assume users stay within the strategy for an extended period of time.\n\nThe current recursive strategy sAVAX/wAVAX is generating around 23.9% with a low wAVAX utilisation due to the SupplyCap for sAVAX has been reached. This yield will fall as the wAVAX utilisation increases. Assuming the SupplyCap for sAVAX is doubled, the current wAVAX interest rate curve becomes the limiting factor on the profitability of the strategy. The SupplyCap on wAVAX has a utilisation of 24.35% and offers considerable deposit capacity. There was no BorrowCap for wAVAX at the time this proposal was drafted.\n\nTo reduce the volatility in the borrow rate between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal, a Base of 1% is introduced whilst keeping the Base + Slope1 interest rate as calculated above. This generates a Slope1 of 4.72%.\n\nAdjusting the Uoptimal parameter improved the capital efficiency of the AVAX reserve. Adjusting from 45% to 65% is a substantial increase. The current utilisation is a lot lower, 28.49% and is expected to increase substantially, possibly 56.98% when the sAVAX SupplyCap is to be doubled. This is still short of the 65% Uoptimal parameter and offers users an attractive yield on the strategy. With future SupplyCap increases, the Uoptimal parameter can be revised. With a Uoptimal of 65%, there remain sufficient liquidity in the reserve to liquidate users. It is also worth noting a $5.055m USDC swap for wAVAX incurs a 2% price impact via 1inch.\n\nThe Slope2 parameter has been reduced from 300% to 144.28% to generate a borrow rate of 150% at 100% utilisation. This reduced the volatility when utilisation is in the Uoptimal < Utilisation <100% range. When utilisation is in this range the recursive strategy is not generating sufficient reward relative to holding sAVAX and will lead to strategy reducing leverage and therefore utilisation of the wAVAX reserve. Because of this relationship a gradual increase in borrowing interest is preferable and thus a lower Slope2 parameter can be implemented.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OpM3rCh.png)\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Variable Base|1.00%|\n|Uoptimal|65.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|4.72%|\n|Variable Slope2|144.28%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |4.72%|\n|Stable Slope2 |144.28%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |4%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20%|\n\nStable rates have been updated to mitigate any risk of enabling stable borrowing and having a variable borrow rate greater than the stable borrowing rate.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The final proposal will reflect the discussion on the governance forum.\n\naip: TBA\ntitle: ARC - Continue Liquidity Mining Program on Aave V2 Ethereum market and Initiate Liquidity Mining on Aave ARC market\nstatus: Proposal\nauthor: @MatthewGraham, @3SE_Holdings, @4lex.eth\ncreated: 03.02.2022\nDiscussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-aave-v2-ethereum-market-and-aave-arc-market/7189\n\n----\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.\n\nIn addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.\n\n# Abstract\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.\n\n* [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): [2,200 stkAAVE per day](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH): 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n\nContinuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\nThe incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.\n\nIn addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:\n\n1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)\n2. Increase liquidity\n3. Attractive (low) borrow rates\n4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor\n5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform\n\nWithin this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.\n\nKey changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:\n\n* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market\n* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/d/d2ff417f056b6dd50b32d389b8167c92d86a39d4_2_1380x984.png \"Chart\")\nNote: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.\n\nOption 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives. Ie: 10% of (1,540-1,078)\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/6/6bdf8f04d85d9e5f50ffe2ac1c50c278a4865a46_2_1380x248.png \"Chart\")\n\nOption 2) Similar methodology to the above with an assumed market size of $250M and distribution across the assets of 60% USDC, 20% ETH and 10% of both wBTC and AAVE.\n\nAsset Value Deposited Multiplier Daily stkAAVE Incentive LM Allocation (%) LM Incentive Split (%) LM vAPR (%)\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/f/fbfed436c63b075741117d4c19a49510745aade6_2_1380x250.png \"Chart\")\n\nMathematics: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.\n\nAarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.\n\nAave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)\n\nWith the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.\n\nWith the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.\n\n## Economics\n\n* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.\n* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.\n* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.\n* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.\n* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives\n* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.\n\nFurther details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community.
