The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market conditions and its parameters on other deployments.\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Analysis\n\nChaos Labs recommends a 15% reduction. As of October 25, seven total accounts amounting to ~$141 are at risk of liquidation following the proposed changes.\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | 65% | 50% | 141 | 8 |\n\nList of affected accounts:\n\n| Account | Total Supply (USD) | Total CRV Supplied | Total Borrows (USD) | Health | Health After Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0x9ce21324617b6b573e75d28580dcd5a88c41b4bb | 106 | 29.16 | 86.47 | 1.01 | 0.99 |\n| 0xa21fa160a63993d06daf2cb22f66b9a118a25ed4 | 97 | 200.43 | 59.14 | 1.07 | 0.83 |\n| 0xf36375ef8ef450476541f6326631cac44f9f0a49 | 58 | 40.18 | 41.22 | 1.07 | 0.99 |\n| 0xe9784ffc614fe5cc57939cc7b21cdd2cf8f61c86 | 17 | 34.88 | 10.60 | 1.09 | 0.86 |\n| 0x6c62b64c4e1a4702a41c47d5cdafc29fcba0ebad | 12 | 25.77 | 6.63 | 1.23 | 0.95 |\n| 0xdb79b400a31997ebc6816f002f2b622fe186056a | 12 | 25.57 | 6.63 | 1.22 | 0.94 |\n| 0x0906f3f07c7211bdce20d8a7cf9bdd7c3306532d | 4 | 6.7 | 2.65 | 1.14 | 0.96 |\n| 0x304481771f4922b60a759ac363da3a7da6372cc1 | 4 | 0.83 | 3.5 | 1.02 | 1.00 |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 65% | 50% | -15% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum. \n\nGiven the current conditions and protocol usage, we propose 2 options for the community to vote on:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-CRV-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-7-10-32dc4ed994be4029b05af831ce5ea537).\n2. “Moderate” - 3% reduction. This option is aligned with the previous reduction and the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nIn the table below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. \n\n| Option | Liquidation Threshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Moderate | 52 | 3 | $46 |\n| Aggressive | 49 | 5 | $116 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 55 | 52 / 49 | -3% / -6% |\n| CRV | LTV | 49 | 46 / 43 | -3% / -6% |\n\n*Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the “aggressive” and “moderate” options*\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to update four (4) risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT), Loan-To-Value (LTV), Liquidation Bonus (LB), and UOptimal for FEI on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs part of the ongoing risk mitigation strategies implemented for V2 Ethereum, this proposal suggests another series of risk parameter updates to minimize potential exposure to FEI. As a reminder, FEI has been frozen since [September 2022](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/96/), with the RF set at 99%.\n\nOver the past months, we have witnessed a significant drop in market cap, and together with the recent price fluctuations, we recommend decreasing Aave’s FEI exposure to a minimum.\n\nThe recommended measures include the following:\n\n1. Lowering LT and LTV to zero  - This will prevent new borrowings against FEI and potentially further protocol losses should FEI's price fluctuate due to limited liquidity.\n  1. By reducing the LT to zero, two additional accounts will become eligible for liquidation, totaling a value of $1,051. The main account to be liquidated can be found [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/wallets/0xa41f03dd427100284ecaa24734b00abc037557c0)\n2. Raising the LB from 6.5% to 10% to provide a stronger incentive for liquidators to address underwater positions.\n3. Decreasing the UOptimal from 80% to 1% to increase the borrowing rate and encourage borrowers to repay their loans.\n\n## Specification\n\n|Asset|Parameter|Current|Recommendation|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|FEI|LT|75%|1%*|\n|FEI|LTV|65%|0|\n|FEI|LB|6.5%|10%|\n|FEI|UOptimal|80%|1%|\n\n**For technical reasons related to V2 we will set the LT 1% rather than at 0*\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

With consideration of the current usage on Aave and existing liquidity, we recommend implementing the following updates:\n\n1. Set supply caps at the current supply in each deployment\n2. Set borrow cap at the current borrow in each deployment\n3. Set Debt Ceiling at 2*(Liquidity within LB range / MAI LT)\n\n*Note: Final recommendations will be rounded for simplicity*\n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Chain | Current Supply Cap | Recommended Supply Cap | Current Borrow Cap | Recommended Borrow Cap | Current Debt Ceiling ($) | Recommended Debt Ceiling ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Avalanche | 700,000 | 20,000 | 460,000 | 10,000 | 2,000,000 | 10,000 |\n\n\n*Note: Given the current usage on Polygon, these recommendations effectively disable further usage of MAI as collateral.*\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list 1INCH on Aave V3 on Ethereum. 1INCH is currently listed on V2 Ethereum with borrow disabled.\n\nAs the proposed assets in the migration plan are traded with relatively low market cap and trading volume, we have taken a prudent approach in setting borrow caps to account for no more than 1% of the average daily trading volume. The supply cap was derived using our supply cap methodology with the V2 data (simulation results can be seen in the image below). Additionally, we have  adjusted the IR Slope1 to reflect the changes in interest rates over the past months and adjusted the liquidation bonus levels to the current liquidity levels in DEXs.\n\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: 1INCH\n\nContract Address: 0x111111111117dC0aa78b770fA6A738034120C302\n\n| Parameter | 1INCH |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 22M |\n| Borrow Cap | 720,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | $4.5M |\n| LTV | 57.00% |\n| LT | 67.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 9.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Stable Slope1 | 13.00% |\n| Stable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset | 3.00% |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00% |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.
