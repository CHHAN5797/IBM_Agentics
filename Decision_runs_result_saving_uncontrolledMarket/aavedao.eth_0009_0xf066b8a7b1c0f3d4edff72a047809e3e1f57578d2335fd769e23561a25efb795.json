As Aave continues its growth across new ecosystems, it presents a strategic opportunity to extend GHO’s reach alongside it. Sonic’s DeFi sector is currently thriving, and with Aave set to launch on Sonic in the coming weeks, deploying GHO there would be a natural next step.\n\nSonic’s current growth is largely driven by the anticipation of its [upcoming airdrop](https://docs.soniclabs.com/funding/sonic-airdrop), scheduled for June. Users earn points while protocols accumulate gems based on their activity within the ecosystem.\n\nA key part of the early GHO growth strategy on Sonic will be securing liquidity in an Aave Boosted StableSurge Pool on Beethoven, a friendly fork of Balancer v3. This integration enables idle liquidity to be automatically redeployed into Aave to maximize capital efficiency. Additionally, as part of Aave’s collaboration with Balancer, these pools will receive further support, with Beethoven allocating a portion of their “gems” rewards to incentivize GHO liquidity.\n\nJust as with the Base deployment, a well-coordinated strategy is crucial for GHO’s expansion to Sonic. A successful launch will require close collaboration among service providers to build a strong infrastructure, establish appropriate risk parameters, and solidify GHO’s role as a key stablecoin within Sonic’s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis ARFC vote seeks community consensus to move forward with GHO’s deployment on Sonic, paving the way for its continued multichain growth and deeper integration across emerging ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposed deployment of GHO on Sonic will require coordination across several key components:\n\n|Service Provider|Responsibility|\n| --- | --- |\n|Aave Labs + BGD + Certora|Deploy CCIP & Aave Protocol Updates|\n|TokenLogic|Deploy Facilitator, GSM & GHO Steward Updates|\n|Chaos Labs + Risk Llama|GSM, CCIP & Aave Protocol Parameters|\n|ACI + TokenLogic|Incentive Program & Distribution|\n|Aave Liquidity Committee|DEX Liquidity|\n|Gho Stewards|Maintain Risk Parameters|\n\nACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe final timeline and technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and outlined in subsequent AIPs, pending approval of this ARFC.\n\n## Aave Protocol - GHO Reserve Parameters\n\n> Updated proposal 2025-03-15 with Chaos feedback\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Asset|GHO|\n|Market|Sonic|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap|2,500,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,250,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|-|\n|LT|-|\n|Liquidation Bonus|-|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|-|\n|Variable Base|0%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.5%|\n|Variable Slope2|50%|\n|Uoptimal|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|N/A|\n\n## Ethereum <> Sonic Facilitator\n\nA facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum specifically to support Sonic.\n\nGHO is considered to have entered circulating supply when users exchange USDC.e for GHO via the stataUSDC.e GSM on Sonic.\n\nThe initial configuration for the Sonic GhoDirectMinter facilitator as shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Mint Cap|10M Units|\n\nThis is to be implemented by setting the `newFacilitatorBucketCapacity` to to 10M.\n\nReference: [GhoDirectMinter](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-ghodirectminter/20040)\n\n## CCIP Configuration\n\nTo support the launch of GHO on Sonic, the following parameter adjustments are proposed:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Bucket Capacity|+15M Units|\n|Rate Limit Capacity|1,000,000 units|\n|Refill Rate|200 GHO/sec|\n\nThe Bucket increase is additional to the Bucket Capacity at the time to ensure the GSM can be supplied with GHO.\n\nThis is expected to support strong initial growth with the DAO and other expected to be moving large amounts of GHO through the bridge.\n\nReference: [GHO Deployment](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=240)\n\n## GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the stataUSDC.e GSM to be deployed on Sonic.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|GHO Bucket Cap|10.00M|\n|USDC Exposure Cap|5.00M|\n|Freeze Lower Bound|$0.990|\n|Freeze Upper Bound|$1.010|\n|Unfreeze Lower Bound|$0.995|\n|Unfreeze Upper Bound|$1.005|\n|Mint GHO Fee|0.00%|\n|Burn GHO Fee|0.00%|\n\nWith GHO being minted on Ethereum and being transferred to the GSM, the Mint() function on the Ethereum instance of stataGSM is to be replaced by Transfer() functionality. Pre-minted GHO held by the stataGSM on Sonic is to be transferred when USDC is received.\n\n### stataUSDC Revenue\n\nA bot, deployed as part of Dolce Vita will periodically claim the revenue to the DAO's treasury.\n\n### GHO Stewards\n\n**GhoAaveSteward**\n\n* `updateGhoBorrowCap`\n* * The update changes up to 100% upwards and downwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n* `updateGhoBorrowRate`\n* * The update changes up to 5.0% (configurable by the DAO) upwards or downwards the following four variables:\n    * optimalUsageRatio\n    * baseVariableBorrowRate\n    * variableRateSlope1\n    * variableRateSlope2\n  * The initially allowed amount of change for these variables is 5%, but is configurable by the DAO\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n* `updateGhoSupplyCap`\n* * The update changes up to 100% upwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n**GhoGsmSteward**\n\n* `updateGsmExposureCap`\n* * The update changes up to 100% upwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n* `updateGsmBuySellFees`\n* * The update changes up to 0.5% upwards or downwards (in both buy and sell individually)\n  * Asumes that strategy is FixedFeeStrategy created by `FixedFeeStrategyFactory`\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n## Budget\n\nCreate an Allowance for GHO on Ethereum for a total of 1,000,000 GHO from Sonic instance to support the initial growth of GHO on Sonic.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: 0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b\n\nAcquire GHO and deposit into Sonic instance:\n\nEthereum\naEthUSDT (1.00M)\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe ACI & TokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Avalanche ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Avalanche to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Avalanche.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Avalanche will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Avalanche network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Avalanche.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Avalanche ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Avalanche ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Avalanche, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Avalanche protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Avalanche ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Avalanche ecosystem has [previously signaled](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci) a large commitment to supporting GHO’s launch on the network.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Avalanche |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 4,500,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Avalanche's Proposal on Temp Check: Rollout Plan for Cross-Chain GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Base ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Base to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Base.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Base will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Base network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Base.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Base ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Base ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Base, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Base protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Base ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Base and Optimism ecosystem have provided a large commitment already. The DAO has [previously voted](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x15cbc6b6c5b4ef76a1fb8cf8747460bf327c459fa01b69907fab0119457939a8) for a continued incentives program and matching of the OP Retroactive Grant, that can be used to launch GHO on Base.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Base |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 2,500,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 2,250,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[ARFC: Merit Base incentives and SuperFest matching](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-base-incentives-and-superfest-matching/18450)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

When they differ, the most conservative one is selected.\n\n## [ARFC] Launch GHO on Gnosis Chain\n## author: kpk\n## date: 2025-03-13\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to launch GHO on the Gnosis chain and designate ACI as the Emissions Manager for GHO rewards and incentives. Deploying GHO to Gnosis is one part of kpk’s (formerly karpatkey) [mandate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-karpatkey-as-gho-growth-service-provider/20206) and a milestone towards sGHO (savings GHO) deployment. Gnosis Chain has low transaction fees, an engaged community, and a rapidly growing suite of DeFi applications focused on RWAs and innovative payment solutions like [Gnosis Pay](https://gnosispay.com/).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe sGHO vault will provide a risk-minimized yield alternative that can be used as collateral for enhanced capital efficiency, debuting on Gnosis Chain. The first step of this deployment is introducing GHO to the Gnosis Chain, which is renowned for its cost-efficiency, active community, and innovative DeFi landscape, making it an ideal environment for GHO. As GHO Growth Service Provider, kpk has been entrusted with driving community engagement, forging strategic partnerships, and ensuring the successful liquidity bootstrapping of GHO.\n\nThis proposal leverages kpk’s expertise and the favorable market conditions on Gnosis to deploy GHO with risk parameters and smart contract implementations that are finely tuned to the unique characteristics of the Gnosis ecosystem. [sGHO deployment](https://governance.aave.com/t/develop-sgho-a-yield-bearing-gho-vault-for-multi-chain-integration/21350), the [enhancements proposed to the GC Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancements-in-aave-v3-gnosis-chain-instance/21214) and future incentives for GHO (subject to an upcoming proposal on both DAOs) will work together to position GHO as a strong player within Gnosis, enhancing the TVL and revenue for Aave on this chain.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe deployment of GHO on Gnosis will be executed through coordinated efforts among various service providers. The necessary smart contracts and supporting infrastructure will be designed and deployed to enable full GHO functionality on the Gnosis chain, including the implementation of any required cross-chain bridge infrastructure to ensure seamless integration within the Aave ecosystem. In parallel, risk and finance service providers will collaborate to establish risk parameters and collateral requirements specifically optimized for the Gnosis environment, incorporating insights gained from previous network launches.\n\nTherefore, kpk is inviting all Service Providers to provide input on their scopes in this proposal. The proposed launch of GHO at Gnosis Chain will have the following key components:\n\n* BGD and Avara (Aave Labs) to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Gnosis Chain network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Gnosis Chain.\n* Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, a strategic plan will be developed to bootstrap initial liquidity on Gnosis, including tailored incentives and partnerships with established protocols in the ecosystem. @ACI will serve as the Emissions Manager for GHO rewards and incentives.\n\n* ACI multisig address: 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n### GHO parameters\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Asset|GHO|\n|Market|Gnosis|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap|2,500,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,250,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|-|\n|LT|-|\n|Liquidation Bonus|-|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|-|\n|Variable Base|0%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.5%|\n|Variable Slope2|50%|\n|Optimal|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|0%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|N/A|\n\n#### Ethereum ↔ Gnosis GHO Facilitator\n\nA facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum specifically to support Gnosis with this initial configuration:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Mint Cap|10M Units|\n\n#### CCIP Configuration\n\nBridge Facilitator parameters:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Bucket Capacity|+15M Units|\n|Rate Limit Capacity|1,000,000 units|\n|Refill Rate|200 GHO/sec|\n\n#### GHO Stewards\n\nAs with every GHO deployment, GHO Stewards are recommended to be deployed. Stewards would have the same parameter change capabilities as on other chains.\n\n\n### Disclaimer\nkpk is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n### Next Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this ARFC, the proposal will be escalated to the Snapshot stage. Upon a positive Snapshot outcome, service providers will proceed with the appropriate AIPs.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
