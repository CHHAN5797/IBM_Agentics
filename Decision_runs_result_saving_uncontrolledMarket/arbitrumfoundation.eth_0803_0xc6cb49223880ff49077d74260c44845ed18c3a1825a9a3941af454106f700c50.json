    "ai_final_conclusion": "Option 'FOR - replace with MSS ' selected with stance to keep 'Change'.",
    "ai_final_reason": "- Strong timeline and voting analytics indicate dominant support for the FOR option.\n- Forum sentiment shows a slight majority of positive support for enfranchising retail voters via implicit delegation.\n- Historical similar proposals show governance participation benefits, informing the decision to support change.\n- Market impact is negative but not used as a pro argument; focus is on governance health and inclusivity.\n- MSS replacement improves security and reduces operational costs, aligning with community feedback.\n- Some concerns about vote weight and meritocracy exist, but the proposal's design and oversight mechanisms mitigate these risks.\n- Overall, the recommendation aligns with forum sentiment and the long-term benefit of broadening governance participation.",
