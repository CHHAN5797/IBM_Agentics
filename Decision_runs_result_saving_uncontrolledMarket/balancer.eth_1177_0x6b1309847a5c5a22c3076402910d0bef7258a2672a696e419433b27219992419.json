This 50/50 pool is more in line with Balancers longer term ecosystem plans and will generate much deeper liquidity and trading fees for veBAL. I propose for this new pool to be whitelisted instead.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n   • Website https://aura.finance/\n   • Documentation https://docs.aura.finance/\n   • Github Page https://github.com/aurafinance\n   • Communities discord.gg/aurafinance\n   • Other useful links? https://forum.aura.finance/\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nSee here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708\n\nCentered around [@BalancerLabs](https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs)’s veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the 50/50 AURA/ETH pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for AURA in the years to come.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    \n\n[Twitter post on multisigs](https://twitter.com/AuraFinance/status/1534353728987275264)\n\nTreasury multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xfc78f8e1Af80A3bF5A1783BB59eD2d1b10f78cA9/home\n\nProtocol multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x5feA4413E3Cc5Cf3A29a49dB41ac0c24850417a0/home\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nhttps://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nAura is a non custodial, non pausable platform.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nLBP - https://app.aura.finance/\n\n\n**Gauge address**\n\n[Vyper_contract | Address 0x275df57d2b23d53e20322b4bb71bf1dcb21d0a00 | Etherscan ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x275df57d2b23d53e20322b4bb71bf1dcb21d0a00)",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/481\n**Summary:**\n\n> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory v5 and contains three unique staked ethereum tokens, staked frax eth (sfrxETH), wrapped staked eth from Lido (wstETH), and rocket eth from Rocket pool (rETH). As most Balancer community members know, rocket pool and lido have become pillars of the ecosystem through the use of the metastable / composable stable pool types to leverage their yield bearing assets. Staked frax eth will be joining these two juggernauts to facilitate trading and LPing amongst these diverse staking strategies of ETH. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> (sfrxETH) Link to:\n> • [Website ](https://app.frax.finance/)\n> • [Documentation ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens)\n> • [Communities](https://facts.frax.finance/frxeth/validators)\n> (wstETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://stake.lido.fi/)\n> • [Documentation](https://blog.lido.fi/)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/lidofinance)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao)\n> (rETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n> • [Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)\n> • [Github Page](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/usage/contracts/contracts.html#introduction)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sfrxETH is a Frax’s staked wrapped ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido, and rETH is the staked ETH token for Rocket Pool.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the protocols which supply staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer’s users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on each projects forum. [sfrxETH ](https://gov.frax.finance/) , [wstETH](https://research.lido.fi/). , [rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1)\n2. **Oracles:** See each rate provider contract linked here respectively [sfrxETH ](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2237a270E87F81A30a1980422185f806e4549346) , [wstETH ](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb1552c5e96b312d0bf8b554186f846c40614a540#readContract), [rETH ](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xA73ec45Fe405B5BFCdC0bF4cbc9014Bb32a01cd2#code)\n3. **Audits:** See [sfrxETH](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits) , [wstETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits), [rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd). For Lido and wstETH please read [here ](https://lido.fi/faq). Lastly for FRX and sfrxETH see [here ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/overview).\n5. **Market History:** See [rETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth) , [wstETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth) , and [sfrxETH ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on all assets in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.\n\nLink to pool: [0x0c8972437a38b389ec83d1E666b69b8a4fcf8bfd](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x0c8972437a38b389ec83d1e666b69b8a4fcf8bfd00000000000000000000049e)\nLink to gauge: [0x49f530b45Ae792CDF5Cbd5D25C5a9b9e59C6c3B8](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49f530b45Ae792CDF5Cbd5D25C5a9b9e59C6c3B8#code)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x49f530b45Ae792CDF5Cbd5D25C5a9b9e59C6c3B8`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1549\n\n# **Enable Gauge for kaiAURA / AURA (Ethereum)**\n![KAIAURA.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeid2jpzinlw4nsdtjyhe3a625thexjw3ivmsgyxze3ecyyimlskwb4)\n\n## **Summary**\nThis proposal requests the approval of a gauge for the **kaiAURA / AURA pool on Ethereum**. The pool aims to enhance liquidity and yield opportunities for AURA holders while supporting kai’s mission of amplified DeFi rewards.\n\n---\n\n## **Pool Details**\n- **Pool:** [Liquidity Pool (v2): kaiAURA / AURA](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x62e57e37e3185871c13a422a363293780d17305b0002000000000000000006d3)  \n- **Pool Contract:** `0x62e57e37e3185871c13a422a363293780d17305b`  \n- **Gauge Address (Ethereum):** `0x4fd03b8c15e70e6b3413e4d2ff3825a19746e78b`\n\n---\n\n## **References/Useful Links**\n- **Website:** [kaiAura.finance](https://kaiAura.finance)  \n- **Documentation:** [kai Docs](https://docs.kaiaura.finance/)  \n- **Communities:** [X](https://twitter.com/kai_finance_)  \n- **Dapp:** [app.kaiAura.finance](https://app.kaiAura.finance)  \n- **Dune Dashboard:** [kaiAURA Analytics](https://dune.com/kaiauradao/kai)\n\n---\n\n## **Protocol Description**\n- **AURA:** The governance token of Aura Finance, designed to maximize rewards for liquidity providers and veBAL stakers. AURA holders can lock tokens into vlAURA to earn rewards and participate in governance.  \n- **kaiAURA:** A tokenized wrapper of AURA created by kai to amplify staking rewards. Staked kaiAURA receives enhanced yield opportunities.\n\n**kai DAO** is a DeFi protocol designed to optimize and amplify rewards for AURA stakers. By converting AURA into kaiAURA, users access enhanced yield opportunities, including real-time USDC payouts, additional rewards (e.g., Aura, Pal, WETH), and governance participation via the $KAI token. Shortly after launch, kai achieved a position as a top 27 vlAura holder with over $440k TVL, demonstrating significant community interest and growth potential.\n\n---\n\n## **Motivation**\nThe **kaiAURA / AURA gauge** is strategically important for several reasons:\n\n1. **Voting Incentives:** kai has allocated 15,000 USDC for bribe emissions over the first three months for Paladin Quest voting. If the community allocates this, kai could become one of the top 8 apps for historical voting incentives.  \n2. **Support AURA Holders:** This pool offers AURA holders access to kai’s amplified yield opportunities, including real-time rewards, governance utility, and new staking options.  \n3. **Strengthen Balancer Liquidity:** Pairing kaiAURA with AURA increases Balancer’s TVL and trading volume, generating additional fees for the protocol treasury.  \n4. **Boost Ecosystem Collaboration:** Balancer benefits from kai’s integrations, improving liquidity efficiency and attracting new users.  \n5. **Enable Sustainable Growth:** Encourages broader adoption of kaiAURA and AURA, fostering a virtuous cycle of increased liquidity, yield, and governance participation.\n\nThis proposal benefits all stakeholders by strengthening interconnected ecosystems, enhancing liquidity, and maximizing yield opportunities.\n\n---\n\n## **Specifications**\n\n### **Governance**\n- Governed by kai DAO with community-driven initiatives.  \n- **kaiDAO Address:** [0x4696b1123f4c6a03711e2c6e8311350b0350d7c2](https://debank.com/profile/0x4696b1123f4c6a03711e2c6e8311350b0350d7c2)\n\n### **Oracles**\n- No external oracles are required.\n\n### **Audits**\n- **Open Source Code:** [GitHub](https://github.com/kai-aura/kai-Contracts)  \n- Currently unaudited, with plans for auditing in Phase III.  \n- Built on Aura contracts with minimal modifications to enhance user rewards.\n\n### **Centralization Vectors**\n- Non-custodial and decentralized, with strong community engagement and collaboration with ecosystem partners.  \n- Three early contributors and a total of seven contributors.\n\n### **Market History**\n- **Staking Rewards:** kaiAURA stakers earn 2x the rewards of typical vlAura holders due to liquidity incentives and yield dynamics.  \n- **Peg Management:** The pool uses a volatile structure to maintain peg stability, avoiding issues associated with stable swap pools.\n\n---\n\n## **Value Proposition**\n\nThe existence of kaiAura benefits the ecosystem in several ways. Users have additional functionality with Aura. Firstly, A user can convert Aura to kaiAura either 1:1 or (sometimes) market swap in for additional kaiAura and stake for amplified rewards, as not all kaiAura is staked. Also, additional Pal rewards because kai has acquired pal to stake for “Loot” from Paladin ecosystem partner. Plus kai emissions; Plus no lock-up, Plus no fees! As a liquidity provider of kaiAura-Aura a user gets the same price exposure (pure Aura price action) but yield is in the form of swap fees, gauge rewards, and kai emissions.\n\nThe **kaiAURA / AURA pool** benefits the ecosystem in several ways:\n\n- **Liquidity Hub:** Serves as a key trading and liquidity center for AURA and kaiAURA.  \n- **Protocol Revenue:** Increases Balancer’s income via trading fees and liquidity mining.  \n- **User Rewards:** Combines AURA price exposure with swap fees, gauge rewards, and kai emissions.  \n- **Ecosystem Growth:** Strengthens DeFi collaboration and attracts new participants.\n\nBy combining **kai’s innovative yield strategies**, **Aura’s governance framework**, and **Balancer’s robust infrastructure**, this pool marks a significant advancement in DeFi liquidity management.\n\n---\n\n## **Special Note**\nThe pool is a standard Balancer v2 pool with customizable fees. Initially, the fee is set at 1%, with the potential for adjustments to facilitate swap volume.\n\n---\n\n## **Gauge Details**\n- **Gauge Address:** `0x4fd03b8c15e70e6b3413e4d2ff3825a19746e78b`  \n- **Gauge Type:** Ethereum  \n\nWe invite the Balancer community to review and support this proposal. Feedback and discussions are welcome to refine and enhance this submission. Thank you!",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/547\n\n**Summary:**\n\n> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory v5 and contains three unique staked ethereum tokens, staked frax eth (sfrxETH), wrapped staked eth from Lido (wstETH), and rocket eth from Rocket pool (rETH). As most Balancer community members know, rocket pool and lido have become pillars of the ecosystem through the use of the metastable / composable stable pool types to leverage their yield bearing assets. Staked frax eth will be joining these two juggernauts to facilitate trading and LPing amongst these diverse staking strategies of ETH. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> (sfrxETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://app.frax.finance/)\n> • [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens)\n> • [Communities](https://facts.frax.finance/frxeth/validators)\n> (wstETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://stake.lido.fi/)\n> • [Documentation](https://blog.lido.fi/)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/lidofinance)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao)\n> (rETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n> • [Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)\n> • [Github Page](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/usage/contracts/contracts.html#introduction)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sfrxETH is a Frax’s staked wrapped ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido, and rETH is the staked ETH token for Rocket Pool.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the protocols which supply staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer’s users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on each projects forum. [sfrxETH ](https://gov.frax.finance/), [wstETH](https://research.lido.fi/), [rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1)\n2. **Oracles:** See each rate provider contract linked here respectively [sfrxETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf752dd899F87a91370C1C8ac1488Aef6be687505), [wstETH ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15), [rETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x658843BB859B7b85cEAb5cF77167e3F0a78dFE7f)\n3. **Audits:** See [sfrxETH](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits), [wstETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits), [rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd). For Lido and wstETH please read [here](https://lido.fi/faq). Lastly for FRX and sfrxETH see [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/overview).\n5. **Market History:** See [rETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth), [wstETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth), and [sfrxETH](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on all assets in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.\n\nLink to pool: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x5F8893506DDC4C271837187D14A9C87964A074DC000000000000000000000106\nLink to child gauge: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5669FB0DCfA758Bf69FB3AdAB14578EDe14cc89A\nLink to root gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6A2C2d4502335638d2c2f40f0171253fb2c2db88#readContract\n\nSpecification: \n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x6A2C2d4502335638d2c2f40f0171253fb2c2db88`\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",

The approval of this gauge for the 80/20 AURA/ETH pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for AURA in the years to come.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    \n\n[Twitter post on multisigs](https://twitter.com/AuraFinance/status/1534353728987275264)\n\nTreasury multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xfc78f8e1Af80A3bF5A1783BB59eD2d1b10f78cA9/home\n\nProtocol multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x5feA4413E3Cc5Cf3A29a49dB41ac0c24850417a0/home\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nhttps://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nAura is a non custodial, non pausable platform.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nLBP - https://app.aura.finance/\n\n\n**Gauge address**\n\n[Vyper_contract | Address 0x006aad228d44655c4c97cdda600f2d56e99569b9 | Etherscan ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x006aad228d44655c4c97cdda600f2d56e99569b9)",
