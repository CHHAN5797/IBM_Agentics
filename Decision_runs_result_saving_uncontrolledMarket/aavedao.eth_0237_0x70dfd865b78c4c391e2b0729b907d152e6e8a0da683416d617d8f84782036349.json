        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.

        "body": "## Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $2M.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn November 2023, Chaos Labs’ engagement with Aave DAO was [unanimously renewed](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/360/), underscoring our ongoing commitment and the expanded scope of our engagement with Aave, which has evolved significantly with Aave's expansion now across over 10 deployments.\n\nThis renewal was done during the bear market, prompting us to propose a community-friendly deal at a lower-than-market cost, given the challenging market conditions and being mindful of the broader economic environment. This was aligned with the feedback from major Aave stakeholders and delegates. However, the expansion of Aave to multiple chains, in addition to the increased volatility and activity across DeFi and crypto, has significantly increased our scope and workload, necessitating additional resources to maintain the high level of service required. \n\nAs dedicated risk contributors, Chaos Labs adopts a holistic approach to managing the spectrum of responsibilities within Aave's ecosystem, including V3, GHO, and the continued offboarding of V2. Our commitment encompasses risk management, data science, analytics, and parameter recommendation, among other critical functions. An amendment to our compensation is essential to reflect better the resources committed, the depth of our engagement, and the substantial value we bring to the Aave community.\n\nConsidering improved market conditions and Aave’s growth over the past several months, we believe the DAO is now in a position to revise our compensation to more accurately reflect the current scale and impact of our engagement and allocated resources.\n\n### Enhancing Aave's Risk Management Framework\n\nThe proposed compensation amendment is not merely a financial adjustment but a continued investment in our collaboration. With additional funding, Chaos Labs will be poised to:\n\n- **Deploy Additional Resources:** Enhance support for existing and future Aave markets, ensuring comprehensive risk management across all deployments.\n- **Develop and Optimize Risk Oracles:** Focus efforts on the continued development of the Chaos Risk Oracle specifically for Aave’s needs, enabling more efficient and dynamic risk parameter adjustments. This will further streamline the risk management process, reducing the need for manual interventions and significantly boosting the protocol's operational efficiency and security.\n- **Expansion of Risk Monitoring and Alerts:** Our real-time monitoring and alert services are delivered via the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). We're committed to enriching these services with more comprehensive analytics and alerts, enhancing visibility and enabling users to meticulously evaluate ecosystem risks and the health of the protocol through intuitive dashboards and data visualizations. The deployment of Risk Oracles will introduce additional data, providing the community with an improved grasp of risk levels and updates to protocol parameters.\n\n### Collaborative Expansion with a Second Risk Service Provider\n\nFollowing Gauntlet's resignation as the second-risk service provider, we strongly support the idea of bringing on another service provider to complement our existing scope of work. As part of our engagement, we are committed to dedicating the required resources to assist with the onboarding process and ongoing collaborations, ensuring a seamless integration that enhances Aave's risk management capabilities without duplicating efforts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe requested compensation amendment is key for Chaos Labs to sustain and expand its support for Aave. It will enable us to allocate additional resources effectively, develop innovative solutions like the Risk Oracle, and continue our mission to enhance Aave's security and efficiency. We are committed to our partnership with Aave and believe that with the community's support, we can continue setting the standards for risk management in the industry.\n\n## Specification:\n\nWe request an additional $400K for the remainder of our current engagement, bringing the total annual compensation to $2M. \n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 400,000 aUSDC or GHO. \n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and more. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP).\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nApprove further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.\n\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.\n\nWhile Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.\n\nThis creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.\n\nFor the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.\n\n\n## Specification\nTo achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:\n\n- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.\n- All assets have to be withdrawn.\n\nTo minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.\n\n### Phase 1\nIn a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:\n\n- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).\n- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.\n- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).\n- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.\n- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.\n\nThe exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.\n\n### Phase 3\nOnce the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.\n\nIt is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.\n\n---\n\nAfter all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.\n\nFinally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",

Our goal is to deliver continuous risk management and R&D to the DAO. We aim to maintain and improve Aave’s strong risk standards and support Aave’s growth and development with a risk conscious approach.\n\n## Who we are\n\nAllez Labs is a team of data and risk experts with deep experience with Aave and its community since 2019. We have been involved in nearly all risk events that have affected the protocol.\n\n## Allez Labs’ founding members\n\n[Alex BertoG](https://governance.aave.com/u/alex_bertog/summary): Former Risk Lead at Aave Companies, as part of the Genesis team, Alex has been pivotal in establishing and evolving Aave's risk frameworks. Her extensive expertise allowed her to make significant contributions securing Aave's stability and facilitating its growth. Over nearly four years, she was instrumental in establishing the DAO's risk frameworks, setting V1 & initial risk parameters, onboarding risk providers, contributing to Aave's design, managing crises, and supporting the launch of GHO. Socials: [twitter](https://twitter.com/A_BertoG), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-bertomeu-gilles-a1858728/), [lens](https://hey.xyz/u/abertog)\n\n[Khaled G](https://governance.aave.com/u/kakagri): Former senior analyst at Block Analitica, he also worked as a quantitative researcher at Aave Companies for over a year under Alex’s leadership. He contributed to Aave by building quantitative risk frameworks, reviewing and providing feedback to service provider proposals/parameters/methodologies, developed from the ground up a simulation engine for Aave and the relevant DeFi primitives, helped manage crisis situations, contributed to GHO’s initial parameters and designed the first version of the GSM. Socials: [twitter](https://twitter.com/iamkakagri), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaled-grira-math/)\n\nMatt Cole*: Former Staff Engineer (Data Scientist) at Aave Companies for the past two years, working on the risk team and later leading data efforts for Aave and GHO internally. He has constructed comprehensive Aave, GHO, and DeFi databases, assisted protocol engineering through simulations and quantitative analysis, and contributed to risk efforts by estimating impact of parameter changes and responding to crises. Previously Matt worked in digital market auction design as well as in traditional finance conducting collateral modeling. Socials: [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xMC2), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattkcole/), [lens\n](https://hey.xyz/u/mcsquared)*available March 29th 2024\n\n## Our Mission\n\nOur mission is simple - to deliver the research, data, and tooling to best position our clients for success in the ever changing DeFi ecosystem. We will achieve this through thoughtful and deep quantitative and qualitative analysis, community engagement and empowerment, and promoting a culture of transparency and collaboration. By integrating these principles into our approach, we envision a future where Aave sets new industry standards for risk management and operational excellence, driving sustainable growth and securing user trust across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## Our Values\n\n**Impactful Contribution:** Allez Labs prioritizes areas where our expertise can significantly enhance the protocol's stability and growth. Through strategic focus and dedicated effort, we believe that our work can lead to substantial improvements, driving Aave towards achieving its full potential in the DeFi landscape. Our roadmap adapts based on the most pressing needs of the DAO, and where we can have the greatest impact.\n\n**Community-Centric Innovation:** Our approach to risk management is deeply rooted in serving the community. We utilize transparent, robust methodologies to deliver risk recommendations that are both effective and intuitive, reflecting the dynamic nature of DeFi markets and the needs of the DAO. Allez Labs is committed to democratizing access to risk insights, offering the community tools and reports that require deep expertise and data to build yet are accessible to the wider community. By focusing on clarity, we will empower the community with the knowledge needed for sound decision-making, thereby contributing to a more resilient and vibrant Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Transparency:** We champion transparency as a pillar of the DeFi ecosystem. By fostering the development and adoption of transparent methodologies, such as open sourcing code and frameworks, we aim to create a culture of mutual growth and innovation. This philosophy is rooted in our belief that progress in the DeFi space is a collective journey, propelled by shared knowledge and collaboration.\n\n**Empowering Autonomy:** Central to our ethos is the goal of minimizing dependency on any single service provider, including ourselves. We envision a future where the Aave DAO is equipped with the knowledge and tools to independently manage risk. To this end, we are dedicated to open-sourcing our data pipelines and models, ensuring that our contributions have a lasting impact and support the DAO's journey towards self-reliance. Our objective is clear: to build a foundation that not only serves immediate needs but also empowers future generations of the Aave community.\n\n## Our approach as a risk provider\n\nOur focus is on providing clear, actionable risk management insights that enhance understanding of the interplay between growth opportunities and potential risks. Through transparent methodologies and open communication, we commit to empowering the Aave DAO with the knowledge needed for informed decision-making, thereby fostering a proactive, risk-aware community.\n\nOur mission is aligned with the evolving priorities of the Aave DAO and its stakeholders. Whether the focus shifts towards GHO, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), or other areas of interest, Allez Labs is dedicated to adapting our resources to meet these needs. By maintaining a flexible approach, we ensure that while we concentrate on the DAO's current priorities, we also keep a vigilant eye on the broader risk landscape. Our goal is to provide targeted, relevant contributions that not only address immediate concerns but also strengthen Aave's resilience and strategic position in the long term.\n\n# Proposal\n\nAllez Labs proposes to partner with Aave DAO, leveraging our extensive experience in risk management and our commitment to open-source principles to enhance the protocol's stability and growth across Aave V3 and GHO. Our mission is to protect Aave from a broad spectrum of risks through employing a holistic strategy that not only focuses on mitigating immediate threats through qualitative and quantitative modeling, but also on embedding long-term risk management solutions into the protocol's design. With a focus on transparency, community engagement, and open-source development, we pledge to empower the Aave community with the knowledge and tools necessary for informed decision-making, fostering a more robust, inclusive, and thriving ecosystem.\n\n## Scope\n\n**Aave V3**\n\n* **Asset Listing Support:** We will provide analysis for new asset listings on all V3 markets for all assets that pass the Temp Check stage.\n* **New Deployment Risk Assessments:** Aave V3 is now active on 10 chains and we anticipate the DAO will vote to explore additional networks in the upcoming year. As such, we will provide market risk and liquidity assessments for new deployment proposals as well as initial assets and parameterizations for these new networks.\n* **Ad Hoc Parameter Recommendations:** Recognizing Chaos Labs' effective and proactive adjustments to market parameters, Allez Labs will offer supplementary analyses and strategic recommendations for V3 market parameters, targeting enhanced ecosystem stability and refined risk management.\n* **LRT Listing Framework:** As Liquid Restaking Tokens become increasingly popular, Allez Labs will create and publish a LRT listing framework with support from the greater Aave community to best onboard and manage these assets within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**GHO**\n\n* **Aave V3 Facilitator Parameterization:** This includes parameter recommendations to manage market and liquidity risks, while ensuring GHO’s competitiveness. Parameters to be tuned are borrow cap, interest rates, and stkAAVE discounts.\n* **GHO Peg Stability:** Our team will develop strategies to minimize peg volatility and drive GHO growth through renewed trust in GHO’s stability, allowing for increased GHO borrow caps. We will work with the GHO Liquidity Committee to supply relevant GHO peg analysis and data.\n* **GSM Parameterization:** Adjust the GHO Stability Module parameters to most effectively support GHO’s peg.\n* **Support Cross-Chain GHO Rollout:** Allez Labs will conduct analyses to assess and mitigate risks associated with the cross-chain expansion of GHO, guided by the initiative and framework set by Aave Labs.\n\n**Protocol**\n\n* **Risk Steward:** Take on the role as the second service provider on the risk steward multistig.\n* **Incident Response:** As needed, when emergency security threats arise, we will provide guidance, threat and impact analyses in order to mitigate the threats.\n* **Automated Risk Management:** We will work with other risk providers and stakeholders to begin development of risk parameter automation strategies to streamline the DAO’s risk process where the trade offs are clear. These may include:\n  * Automation around WETH interest rate parameters which are primarily driven by LST yield\n  * Automation around Supply and Borrow caps for new deployments\n\n### Roadmap\n\n* **Immediate:** Ad hoc risk parameter recommendations for V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche markets, support for GHO related items, assume risk stewardship responsibilities, new deployment risk assessments.\n* **Short-Term Objectives (First 3 Months):** Active risk parameter recommendations on GHO and all remaining active V3 markets, support for GSM parameterization and remaining GHO items. Risk analysis work for cross-chain GHO.\n* **Med-Term Objectives (Following 3 Months):** Automated risk management development report, LRT listing framework publication.\n\n### Requested Budget\n\nFor the operations of Allez Labs over a 6-month period a budget of $400,000 is proposed. This budget will enable us to cover operational costs including, but not limited:\n\n* Legal fees\n* Node and data provider subscriptions\n* Cloud costs\n* Salaries, and hiring of additional analysts and developers as needed\n\n### Terms\n\n* 6-month engagement\n* 400,000 GHO streamed linearly throughout the engagement\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\n\nFrom the DAO’s experience with service providers, inspired by BGDs proposal, the following metrics are good measures of performance:\n\n* Monthly recaps of Allez Labs’ contributions to the DAO with tracking of the progress on the scope and various contributions.\n* Provable participation and/or delivery of the projects described in the scope.\n* Direct or indirect participation in projects of other fields of contribution.\n* Feedback from other contributors and DAO members.\n* Direct and transparent engagement with the DAO via this governance forum.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Engage with the community and other service provides to refine the proposal\n2. Escalate the proposal strengthened by stakeholders’ feedback to ARFC\n3. Execution upon approval\n4. Immediate support for GHO, Aave V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism and Avalanche.\n5. Support for all Aave V3 markets along the timeline proposed.\n\n\n\n\n*Copyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)*",
