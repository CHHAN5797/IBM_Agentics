        "body": "---\n\ntitle: ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token\nstatus: WIP\nauthor: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham\ncreated: 21-03-2022\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nAcquire 200,000 BAL tokens via a combination of performing a BAL for AAVE token swap. The BAL tokens are to be complemented with ETH and deposited into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year. The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nPerform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens. The exchange rate to be used is the 90-day moving average price when the votes pass on both sides. \n\nAll 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer's revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March. \n\nInitially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [2].\n\nWhen the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.\n\nIn addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [3]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.\n\nBy exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange, plus additional acquisition, is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [4]. Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5]. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.\n\nAave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.\n\nThe initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [6].\n\nThe initial sizing was also determined by the ability to influence how the BAL emissions are to be distributed. If all BPT from the BAL : ETH pool are converted to veBAL, Aave will receive 3.3% of the 14,500 BAL emission schedule which is equivalent to 478 BAL weekly, or $8,126/week at $17/BAL or $422,552/year. If 100% of the current BPT were deposited into the veBAL contract, the yield is very close to 10%. Other deployments from the Reserve Factor will also earn BAL rewards over time, [7].\n\nWith 3.3% of veBAL supply, Aave will determine where 2,680 of the 81,200 BAL tokens are to be distributed each week via the Ethereum mainnet pool gauge. This is equivalent to 5% APR on a $47.40M pool without any compounding or other yield sources like swap fees or yield from Aave markets. This is sufficient to support bootstrapping new liquidity pools that support growing TVL for the Aave community. Given the size of the Aave community investment in the Balancer community, it is reasonable to think that Liquidity Mining Committee may also be voting to allocate a portion of there 14,500 weekly BAL emission to support Balancer Boosted Pools which drive TVL to Aave markets.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe token swap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [8].\n\nThe aBAL holding in the Reserve Factor, 1,890 aBAL at the time of writing which will be redeemed for BAL and deployed along with the 200,000 BAL tokens attained via the proposed swap, [9].\n\nOnce the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor from there the BAL and matching amount of ETH will be deployed into the BAL : ETH pool on Balancer V2. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year.\n\nThe veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools\n\n# References:\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512\n[2] https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81/\n[3] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[4] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[5] https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#balances\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-33-swap-between-balancer-dao-and-fei-dao/3555\n[7] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797\n[8] [https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/utils/OtcEscrow.sol](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffei-protocol%2Ffei-protocol-core%2Fblob%2Fdevelop%2Fcontracts%2Futils%2FOtcEscrow.sol&data=04%7C01%7Cmatthew.graham2%40technipfmc.com%7Cfcf199dfb3f64bb3b4ca08da0b1a125b%7C0804c95193a0405d80e4fa87c7551d6a%7C0%7C0%7C637834504350429866%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&sdata=wnFuy5LgP7IJ2G7A4%2B1x%2FBMp1k1bbqw9%2Bk6jkuimd0E%3D&reserved=0)\n[9] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The final proposal will reflect the discussion on the governance forum.\n\ntitle: ARC - Consolidate Aave V1, V2 & AMM Reserve Factors, Purchase CVX and Deploy to Earn Yield\nauthor: Llama Community @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon \ncreated: 03/01/2022\n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThe Aave V1, V2, and AMM market Reserve Factors (RF) on the Ethereum network hold a combined value of over [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). The Llama Community proposes consolidating the RF into the V2 RF and deploying the capital with the intention of retaining TVL and earning additional yield. The yield generated comes with the added benefit of acquiring governance tokens of other DeFi protocols and increasing Aave’s metagovernance influence.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe Llama Community recommends implementing several yield generating strategies spanning Balancer, Curve, and Convex and subsequently participating in the respective communities' tokenomic constructs. Aave will earn yield in the form of swap fee income, aToken yield derived from Aave V2, and governance token incentives in the form of BAL, CRV, CVX, stkAAVE and LDO.\n\nThe first investment theme is deploying capital into the Balancer Boosted Pool and BTC Stable Pool to earn a vAPY of around 13.4% and 4.6% respectively. The Balancer Boosted Pool invests around 80% or more of the deposited liquidity into Aave V2 to earn yield whilst also generating swap fees, stkAAVE, and BAL rewards. The Stable Pool generates income via swap fees and BAL rewards, with the latter making up the majority of the incentives on both strategies.\n\nThe second investment theme is more complex. It involves acquiring both CVX and veCRV to participate in gauge weight voting on Curve in order to influence a portion of the CRV inflation schedules to be distributed to aToken pool Liquidity Providers (LPs). Aave will deploy stables and ETH from the RF to earn additional CRV and CVX rewards, which will be used to further boost the incentive allocation to the aToken pools.\n\nThe data presented here is accurate as of the end of December 2021 data.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Part A - Consolidation\n\nThe legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~[$219M](https://app-v1.aave.com/home) of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time.\n\n![|602x232](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Kqln89Od7cLnxfnd5sEq4gn6xMD2yrAocqa8nJOaXQoyjQ4GlNkgfw8pQ7E2skefYXPdtiqSLwWL_KtYcNiO6Qjciy0I296Q7eiz0R9_NEO1nhZSPJtMqR-eDXg4N7SOqTj-zsEC)\n\nThis proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around ~[$821K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$27.45M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). A summary of the main assets held in the V1 RF are shown below:\n\n![|602x232](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/947026c5031f95dbb5c76d9939f772d746867d90.png)\n\n## Part B - Retain TVL & Increase Returns\n\nWhilst holding aTokens is arguably one of the lowest risk yield opportunities in DeFi and something Llama Community encourages most, if not all, treasuries to hold. The Aave DAO is fortunate since it receives income in the form of aTokens. Thus, Llama recommends firstly making all unproductive stable coins productive and then optimizing further by earning additional yield and metagovernance influence.\n\nThe two main high level strategies proposed in this ARC share three common goals:\n\n* Retain TVL within Aave\n* Exceed aToken returns\n* Accumulate metagovernance influence\n\nIn addition to these three goals, the Convex / Curve strategies have the added benefit of improving the extrinsic use cases for aTokens. aToken holders will be able to deposit liquidity into the Curve aToken pools and then deposit the Liquidity Provider (LP) token into either Curve or Convex to earn additional yield.\n\nThe Compound pool on Curve has [$174.5M](https://curve.fi/compound/) of TVL relative to the Aave pool which has [$55.3M](https://curve.fi/aave/) of TVL.This is most likely due to the higher incentive APR that the Compound pool, 10.13% vAPY, relative to the Aave pool earning 7.58% vAPY on Convex.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Overview\n\nLlama proposes diversifying $26,67M (94.36%) of the combined Ethereum RFs across three protocols: Convex, Curve and Balancer. The combined Aave V1, AMM, and V2 market RF totals [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) at the time of writing. A detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) and a high-level overview is shown in the figure below.\n\n**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bst-8FdWe_RfGSXcDYeItuso4X58wWylaIo06XSnRjax0JJ7UfnjUPM7p-5bGYdu6QrdtGkkUzbzyu5kLe-4a17tLCFY5WD5Wj6gPD7YSuoHfjVfsqNfy2nlM47NQNmZPp7GeQKH \"Chart\")**\n\nThe table below shows the assets that will be deployed within this proposal. Note this is only 94.4% of the assets and 5.6% of the assets are to remain unchanged within the Aave V2 RF.**\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c10a19f49f9edbbd241d7a280d0a0541e2bf9316.png)\n\n\nThe table above includes the following stablecoins, DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD and sUSD from the Aave V1 and V2 markets. The AMM markets holdings have not been included as they only total $119.3K at the time of writing.\n\nThe table below shows asset allocation per each strategy:\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/33eaba04a8080fdd0c5b6496090155a98965bab4.png)\n\nThe balance within the Aave V2 RF, not deployed in one of the above strategies is shown as Other (Longtailed Assets) in the figure below. The percentages reflect the overall composition of the RF, noting that 94.4% of the consolidated RF is deployed into one of the strabled detailed in the above table.\n\n**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DLtTpPMVMYL0mhKSaCrroYwwD4r3-3uRDgwUjLIeZjrmMwnQ8i7-PSfgrwnHJLJnd5b4GfeTIhVuaW1emtWc12o-YFyQTqgVMOMyPni023sKbTxZFpyneBVCGu_eV3u-UuvOcsLc \"Chart\")**\n\nThe actual implementation of this proposal is likely to be spread across several AIPs. This is to reduce the implementation complexity and allow the several positions to be swapped / redeemed before being deployed into a bonding curve whilst we await the Chainlink CVX oracle being released and getting the Aave V2 RF whitelisted to deposit into the CRV locking contract to attain veCRV.\n\nThe subsequent sections provide further insight into each strategy and how they are to be funded.\n\n## Convex / Curve Strategy\n\n### Convex Allocation\n\nThe Convex (CVX) allocation is to be funded by the assets mentioned in the table below:\n\n**![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/468f451db851df2f8c4ec9f3bc28fd81647492da.png)**\n\nIn order to fund the initial $2M purchase of CVX, all of the AMPL, BUSD and TUSD will be used ($842.2K) and the balance, $1,16M, will be funded with USDC. This is the initial purchase of CVX and with a unit price of $43.20 is equivalent to about 46,300 CVX tokens.\n\nWe expect to make additional CVX purchases in order to meet the minimum voting hurdle required to influence how Convex’s veCRV holding is deployed on Curve gauges. Based upon this [snapshot](https://vote.convexfinance.com/#/proposal/QmRgsaGswSgzuzaiiH385StTGsv5TVdhAA1LWBGWR3yyLp) and the [Voting Rules and Information](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/voting-and-gauge-weights) section of Convex’s documentation, we estimate around 70,000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate. This is expected to cost a further $1.02M to what is proposed above and represents less than 1 months revenue. We intend to fund this through future revenue and have a sufficient buffer to the hurdle rate based upon voter participation on Convex’s snapshot.\n\nThe assets are to be converted to ETH and then used to purchase CVX via a Bonding Curve with a 50 bps premium that utilizes a Chainlink oracle price feed. Alternative methods can be discussed in the comments. However, we opt for a solution that can be implemented entirely through the AIP governance process and does not include manual trading.\n\nAMPL is the most illiquid of the mentioned tokens and this position will need to be converted to ETH over a series of transactions. Trades are to be routed through an aggregator with MEV protection like CowSwap. The most liquid AMPL pools are on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap. Wherever possible, aTokens will be swapped rather than redeemed in an attempt to retain TVL in the Aave V2 market.\n\nThe newly acquired CVX will be locked for 16 weeks with voting rights delegated to Llama in order to vote on both Aave and sAave gauges via Convex’s snapshot to increase the amount of CRV rewards received on the Curve pools. Voting occurs every 2 weeks via Snapshot and thus the need for a delegate.\n\nThe locked CVX also receives a portion of the protocol fee income and votes on how Convex’s veCRV are distributed across Curve’s gauges. Llama Community acting as the delegate will vote to boost CRV rewards on the Aave pool as a priority and sAave once sufficient voting influence has been attained.\n\n### 4 Year Locked Curve (veCRV) Allocation\n\nThe aCRV tokens that have accumulated within Aave V2 are to be redeemed for CRV and then locked for 4 years on Curve to receive an equal amount of veCRV. This strategy is subject to Aave’s V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curve’s governance process.\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/21477469e7d025cafd72614e98c3e6cd4e3236cf.png)\n\nThe veCRV position will then be used to vote for CRV incentives to be allocated to the Aave and sAave pools via the respective gauges. Based on the CVX strategy discussed prior, these veCRV votes are likely to be allocated to the sAave gauge.\n\nSubject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curve’s veCRV contract, the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV, then stake to earn CRV, CVX and 3crv, pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders. This is expected to generate 47.35% vAPY, see snippet below.\n\n**![|602x244](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v6jyNfHVIrr7ovNveVCupxypxFTzoZfLAP3_aGSwRHVcNezLxZIPvmmLHitPMI7TzrFRm9G-SRpimpcuJqnZLX-OvJ5SUai1_2jStwPxr02Uyge60q2WDCx0dS4eU4GnwAblDACD)**\n\nThe earned CRV will be converted to cvxCRV and this will compound over time. The earned CVX will be locked to increase Aave’s voting influence and the 3crv will be exchanged for CRV, then converted to cvxCRV to further compound the strategies returns over time.\n\n### Productive aToken Stable Strategy\n\nThe sAave and Aave strategies include depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE, CVX and CRV rewards. The two strategies are expected to generate around 4.07% vAPY and 6.19% vAPY before Aave’s CRV and CVX voting influences the CRV incentive derived yield.\n\nThe table below shows the allocation, how each strategy is funded, and which pool those funds are to be deposited into.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/03ca5c3d9bf70c960c6769e35b6a630d64b6ce18.png)\n\n### Productive ETH Strategy\n\nAfter transferring the ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF, the awETH is to be redeemed for ETH and the combined ETH deposited into the Curve stETH pool. The LP token steCRV is to then be deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV, CVX and LDO incentives. The expected yield is around 6.65% vAPY.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/3d101f6f395bb1310f0d58031136da366e6ee838.png)\n\nNo vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used to attract CRV incentives on this pool as the pool does not contain any aTokens.\n\n## Balancer Strategy\n\n### Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy\n\nBalancer has recently launched the first [Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe?utm_source=website&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=aaveboostedpools) on Wednesday 16th December and liquidity mining incentives have already commenced generating around 13.4% vAPY at the time of writing. Using the [Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063) as a guide, we expect Balancer to grow the Boosted Pool with the use of Liquidity Mining (LM) and even replace the Stable Pool in time.\n\nThe Balancer Boosted Pools earn swap fee income, LM incentives, and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield. Llama expects the yield of the Boosted pool to exceed the Stable Pool in order to entice users to move across. Llama expects LM incentives to be the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase.\n\nThe strategy for Aave is to deposit an equal amount of DAI, USDC and USDT into the Boosted Pool. All BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/57b902e46f625cfea122142b56fd0d0ccbe75579.png)\n\nPost is to long.\n\nsee: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797",

CVX is the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCVX is not currently listed on major lending markets, including CVX on the platform would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage. This has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earn asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around $578.04k at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance. Further details can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n##  Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nLlama Community has presented a proposal to deposit Aave community funds into Curve and Convex Finance. Listing CVX on Aave enables Aave to earn aCVX tokens which can then be used to support the treasury management proposal detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?**\n\nConvex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted $CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV.. Adding support for $CVX will in turn provide future opportunities as Convex will also support other protocols in time. ie: FXS\n\nCVX is the governance token of the Convex protocol. By locking $CRV for life on Convex, each user gives his veCRV voting power to vlCVX holders (CVX lockers). Every vlCVX holders can vote on Convex governance proposals but also Curve governance proposals and gauges weights (5.05 veCRV/vlCVX). In the future, each vlCVX holders will control voting power on other tokens like FXS (users already can lock for life FXS for cvxFXS but vlCVX holders cannot vote on Frax governance proposals and gauges weights).\n\n**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nCVX would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem. Adding CVX creates another use case outside of the Convex tokenomics model. Llama expects the CVX demand to be similar to CRV. Additionally:\n\n* Significant Borrow Demand: Users can borrow CVX and then either stake or lock the CVX token to earn yield. In addition to direct yield, investors may borrow CVX to lock and then influence how the inflation schedule of CRV and CVX is distributed. CRV has one of the highest utilisations and dollar value borrowed of all high volatility assets listed on Aave V2.\n* CVX holders can deposit (lend) CVX and then borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).\n\nLlama Community intends to use the aCVX revenue generated to support Treasury Management activities. In this instance, aCVX could be redeemed and locked on Convex to then influence how the CRV and CVX inflation schedule is distributed. Llama Community intends to use the CVX to support growing the Aave and sAave Curve liquidity pools.\n\nThere is $43.2M TVL on the sAAVE pool and $11.8M TVL on the AAVE pool on Convex.\n\nThe Convex community is looking forward to lending and borrowing CVX on Aave. The community will enjoy extra revenues from the reserve factor.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nConvex, as DeFi farmers themselves, the team needed a platform that allowed users to receive the max boost possible from CRV in a simplified manner and allow users to collect their actual rewards directly without auto-selling. They also believe CRV stakers should be rewarded more as they are effectively, mining together with Liquidity Providers. They intend to change that with Convex by charging a lower performance fee, returning fees back to the CRV stakers and CVX token holders, and distributing rewards directly.\n\nThe concept of Convex was published to the public on April 15, 2021 with the protocol launching on May 17, 2021.\n\n30th April 2021 - [Convex platform was whitelisted on the Curve platform](https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-57-whitelist-the-convex-protocol/1654%20and%20Vote%20results:%20https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/44)\n17th May 2022 - [Convex was released](https://convexfinance.medium.com/ready-set-go-69bd68019c5a)\n7th September 2021 - [CVX vote locking went live](https://convexfinance.medium.com/september-update-vote-locking-launch-liquidity-provider-incentives-and-more-1380f406f725)\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**\n\nThe CVX token governs over 559M$ worth of CRV locked in the protocol (and $4M worth of CVX in the Convex treasury multisig). CVX is currently only available on 2 Fuse pools, however there is no liquidity there.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThe emission schedule can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/tokenomics).\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nConvex multisig can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/multisig-admin-rights).\n\n**8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\n* Market capitalisation: $1.35B\n* Average daily volume on the 30 last days: $25,918,420.66\n* CVX is listed on many exchanges, the largest being Gate.io, Sushiswap, Uniswap and Binance Source: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance#markets](http://www.coingecko.com)\n* veCRV controlled /vlCVX: 5.05 veCRV/vlCVX\n\n**9.

FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in lending markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: lending, synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n27K followers on Twitter, 2 17k members in Discord 3, Github\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\tDate of Deployment: March 28, 2021\n\tNumber of Transactions: 81,798\n\tNumber of Holders: 4,089\n\n## Rationale\nBecause FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing and lending. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0x08bbB5922550e6992ebDA8252A31AA02924EF28A\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0xa4893779e193AbD23CE494e5400ca340033606C7\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0xa4767eA500bc04430dE609A523CDc99c9537867C\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0x9f7663e34a2c2Be586126Eed5AF4651b062a51A6\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

The final proposal will reflect the discussion on the governance forum.\n\naip: TBA\ntitle: ARC - Continue Liquidity Mining Program on Aave V2 Ethereum market and Initiate Liquidity Mining on Aave ARC market\nstatus: Proposal\nauthor: @MatthewGraham, @3SE_Holdings, @4lex.eth\ncreated: 03.02.2022\nDiscussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-aave-v2-ethereum-market-and-aave-arc-market/7189\n\n----\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.\n\nIn addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.\n\n# Abstract\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.\n\n* [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): [2,200 stkAAVE per day](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH): 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n\nContinuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\nThe incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.\n\nIn addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:\n\n1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)\n2. Increase liquidity\n3. Attractive (low) borrow rates\n4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor\n5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform\n\nWithin this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.\n\nKey changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:\n\n* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market\n* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/d/d2ff417f056b6dd50b32d389b8167c92d86a39d4_2_1380x984.png \"Chart\")\nNote: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.\n\nOption 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives. Ie: 10% of (1,540-1,078)\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/6/6bdf8f04d85d9e5f50ffe2ac1c50c278a4865a46_2_1380x248.png \"Chart\")\n\nOption 2) Similar methodology to the above with an assumed market size of $250M and distribution across the assets of 60% USDC, 20% ETH and 10% of both wBTC and AAVE.\n\nAsset Value Deposited Multiplier Daily stkAAVE Incentive LM Allocation (%) LM Incentive Split (%) LM vAPR (%)\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/f/fbfed436c63b075741117d4c19a49510745aade6_2_1380x250.png \"Chart\")\n\nMathematics: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.\n\nAarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.\n\nAave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)\n\nWith the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.\n\nWith the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.\n\n## Economics\n\n* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.\n* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.\n* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.\n* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.\n* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives\n* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.\n\nFurther details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community. Please note, each query will need to be run separately.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "This proposal requests to acquire 100,000 BAL tokens via a bonding curve contract, holding them in the Reserve Factor until a decision is made whether to deploy them as veBAL or auraBAL. The proposal aims to strengthen Aave's strategic partnership with Balancer and position Aave for future governance and revenue opportunities related to BAL token usage.",

      "Acquiring additional BAL tokens will position Aave as a top BAL holder and strengthen its strategic partnership with Balancer.",

      "Increasing BAL holdings supports potential growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) via boosted pools and incentivizes demand for GHO stablecoin.",
      "Early participation in veBAL and auraBAL governance could yield competitive advantages in BAL rewards distribution."

    "key_arguments_against": [
      "Concerns about the timing of acquisition given current market volatility and price discrepancies between proposal and market prices.",
      "Uncertainty regarding the immediate benefits of additional BAL acquisition beyond diversification.",
      "Lack of clarity on risk quantification and whether treasury funds should be deployed in the current environment.",
