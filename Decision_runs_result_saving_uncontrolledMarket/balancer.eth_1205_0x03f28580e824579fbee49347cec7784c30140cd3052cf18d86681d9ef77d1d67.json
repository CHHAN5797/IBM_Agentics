This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?

Its main product offerings, tAssets and the Decentralized Offered Rate (DOR), were developed to address a critical gap in the fixed income digital assets market and set a standard for decentralized reference rates.\n\ntETH, the first tAsset deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, is a liquid staking token (LST) that converges the fragmented on-chain ETH interest rates market. Holders of tETH earn real yield exceeding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage across various lending and borrowing protocols, all while retaining the ability to use tETH for other DeFi activities.\n\nSince its launch, the tETH vault has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140 million worth of ETH within just a month and a half.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nTreehouse Protocol is working to establish the tETH-wstETH Gauge on Balancer to enhance the liquidity of tETH. Increased liquidity facilitates smoother entry and exit for traders and investors, which is essential for the overall usability and appeal of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) within the DeFi ecosystem. This liquidity boost not only supports market efficiency but also attracts more participants to the Balancer ecosystem, where the tETH-wstETH pool will generate yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** All ownable contracts are secured with a 5/7 multi-sig. Only the tETH contract is upgradable for future expansion plans.\n\n2. **Oracles:** [tETH-wstETH rate provider](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c53f86d9a6b01821f916802a7606e9255dfe4e2) is based on wstETH as a base asset, it is not compatible with any pools aside from a wstETH pairing for the intended use of a rate provider.\n\n4. **Audits:** Treehouse Protocol has been audited by entities such as Fuzzland, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits and the reports can be seen in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n5. **Centralization vectors:** The centralization vector primarily involves the execution of actions in the strategy contract which are done by a multi-sig appointed by the contract owner. However, all action contracts are well-defined and the executors can only perform the whitelisted actions included in the strategy contract.\n\n6. **Market History:** tETH has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140M worth of ETH since its launch on 10th September 2024. The tETH-wstETH Balancer pool has been in inception since 23 October 2024.

Our main goal is to create a win-win scenario where all participants benefit, ultimately making yields more attractive and accessible to a broader range of users. The concept of veTokens has a proven track record within the industry. Notable projects like Curve/Convex and Balancer/Aura have effectively implemented similar models. We are confident that this approach serves as a potent mechanism for aligning the interests of both liquidity providers and Pendle token holders.\n\nOur native token EQB acts as a governance and incentivisation tool within the ecosystem. Locked EQB tokens will have governance rights in the system and will be able to vote using the protocol owned vePENDLE voting power as well as on internal proposals.\n\nBoost Pendle LP Yield: Our core idea is to align liquidity providers and $PENDLE holders together to maximize incentives for all participants.\n\n* Liquidity providers, who provide liquidity to Pendle through Equilibria, can earn boosted rewards in both $PENDLE and $EQB, even if they do not own any $PENDLE. EQB is our governance token,EQB earned can further be locked to receive a share of the protocol's revenue and to vote and earn bribes.\n\n*  $PENDLE holders, on the other hand, can convert their tokens into $ePENDLE and stake them to earn rewards in both $PENDLE and $EQB. $ePENDLE holders can also easily exit their position by swapping back to $PENDLE, providing flexibility and ease of use.\n\nVoting & Bribe:\n\n* Vote: vlEQB (locked EQB) is available on both Arbitrum and Ethereum. We enable users to vote on multi chains. The votes will be merged to control the vePENDLE Equilibria owned in Pendle's Gauge Voting system. Participating in the Gauge Voting can earn a vote reward from Pendle and potential bribe reward.\n* Bribe: Protocols who have liquidity on Pendle Finance are very keen to buy votes from Equlibria. By doing this, they can get more PENDLE emission on their liquidity. So there will be very promising bribes rewards for all the vlEQB holders. After votes on Snapshot, the bribe reward will be distributed. The voters can claim their bribes at Equilibria website.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Explain why this pool needs incentivization\nThis proposal aims to introduce a veBAL gauge for the ePENDLE/PENDL pool, with the objective of establishing substantial ePENDLE liquidity on Balancer. The inclusion of platform BAL incentives is intended to further enhance ePENDLE liquidity and maintain a more stable peg for ePENDLE. Upon approval, we anticipate actively promoting our new veBAL gauge and leveraging EQB's bribe feature to facilitate incentivization, thereby contributing to the development of the Balancer bribe market narrative. \nThe Equilibria Team remains committed to being a prominent supporter of Balancer technology and a catalyst for BAL emissions through our bribe incentives. Once the ePENDLE/PENDLE pool is eligible for BAL rewards, our bribe feature and strategy will be instrumental in encouraging trading, incentivizing liquidity providers, and fostering LP farming activities on the Balancer platform.\n\n**Specifications:**\n Equilibria Finance has managed to lock approximately 7.8 million PENDLE tokens on our platform, which account for 24% of the total vePENDLE supply. It has been expanding across multiple chains -Ethereum,Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Optimism. This expansion now achieves $64M TVL, and offers diverse opportunities to our users.\n\nYou can view analytics for Equilibria on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official website](https://equilibria.fi/), [official docs](https://docs.equilibria.fi/) and our [DUNE](https://dune.com/lxx1233/equilibria-finance) pages.\n1. **Governance:**  Information on governance [Overview - ](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)[Equilibria votes and snapshots](https://docs.equilibria.fi/mechanism/vote-and-bribes):\n\nProtocols who have liquidity on Pendle Finance, their Pendle emission are determined by votes which investors could use vlEQB to vote at Equilibria snapshot either at Arbitrum or Ethereum, you can visit and vote at Equilibria Snapshot [Epoch #xx] Weekly Pendle Gauge Vote. The official snapshot page is: https://snapshot.org/#/equilibriafi.eth\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?No.\n\n3. **Audits:** \nAt Equilibria, security is our top priority. Our experienced team, with backgrounds at renowned companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Airbnb, has meticulously designed robust security measures. We have undergone rigorous auditing by Peckshield and WatchPug, with detailed reports available at [here](https://docs.equilibria.fi/security-and-risk/audits)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Equilibria employs a 3/5 multi-signature control mechanism and utilize timelock contracts to provide enhanced security and peace of mind for our users.\n\n5. **Market History:** Equilibria launched In June of 2023. Through the ePendle Pool and incentives, Equilibria maintains the flexibility to adjust incentives on ePendle pool and provide more strategy in ePendle pool to boosting the yield in order to optimize supply and demand for ePendle and to maintain its peg to PENDLE. Equilibria’s strategy and mechanics have proven to be resilient at defending the [peg](https://twitter.com/equilibriafi/status/1684563705693097984).

        "body": "**Summary:**\n\nProposal to add a gauge for the RBN / USDC pool on Ethereum. \n\nRibbon Finance intends to mass migrate liquidity from the primary RBN-USDC Uniswap v2/v3 pools to the RBN/USDC 50/50 Balancer pool. If the gauge is added, the Ribbon DAO will provide [25,000 RBN bi-weekly](https://snapshot.org/#/rbn.eth/proposal/0x43b63c97841d37d6658605db163907b4a33171e0447e56ff7983e89746d187fa) as voting incentives for the first two months. Aura Finance will match any incentives provided by Ribbon to help bootstrap liquidity. \n\nI propose that this gauge also be entered as a “core pool” under BIP-19 because this will be the primary on-chain RBN liquidity, Ribbon is heavily incentivizing, and the RBN circulating mcap is ~$100M. The pool will most likely be generating significant swap fees. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Website](https://www.ribbon.finance/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.ribbon.finance/)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/ribbon-finance)    \n    • [Communities](https://discord.com/invite/ribbon-finance)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nRBN is the governance token for the Ribbon Finance protocol. Ribbon is the first and largest DOV (decentralized options vaults) product. We make it easy to sell options on BTC, ETH, and alts. TVL is ~$60M. Similar to Balancer, Ribbon also has a ve mechanism in which holders can lock RBN to accrue protocol revenue from the options vaults. \n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe fees and volume are partially driven by Balancer’s automated voting weight for Core Pools from Balancer Improvement Proposal 19. Furthermore, if the LP is approved for a gauge and receiving automatic voting weight, liquidity providers can earn additional yield through Aura Finance’s ability to boost BAL emissions and supplement with AURA emissions too.\n\nVoting incentives for Aura holders has hovered around 2x in capital efficiency (Source on Llama airforce) over the last month. Meaning, if RBN or other rewards were provided to help bootstrap the liquidity it would be more capital efficient than typical liquidity mining.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Ribbon governance info can be seen [here](https://docs.ribbon.finance/ribbonomics/overview-and-rbn-tokenomics) and their snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/rbn.eth). Ribbon Finance DAO [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdaeada3d210d2f45874724beea03c7d4bbd41674).     \n\n2. **Oracles:** The protocol relies on chainlink oracles on BTC, ETH, AAVE, and other assets to calculate the spot prices when determining options payouts in the DOV's.\n\n3. **Audits:** We have Ribbon V2 vaults audits:\n\n* V2 audits:\n        - openzeppelin: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/ribbon-finance-audit/\n        - chainsafe: https://github.com/ChainSafe/audits/blob/main/Ribbon%20Finance/RibbonV2-July-2021.pdf\n\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Protocol assets are not accessible by any entity by design. Options payouts to the users and market makers are wholly determined via smart contracts and use of chainlink oracles. Protocol uses keepers to roll options over on a weekly basis.\n\n5. **Market History:** [RBN price](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ribbon-finance).

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/288)\n\n# Summary:\n\n> This BIP requests a gauge for the 55/45 auraBAL/wstETH pool to build liquidity of auraBAL on Arbitrum.\n\n# References/Useful links:\n\n> • Website https://aura.finance/\n> • Documentation https://docs.aura.finance/\n> • Github Page Aura Finance · https://github.com/aurafinance\n> • Communities Discord: aurafinance\n> • Other useful links? https://forum.aura.finance/\n\n# Protocol Description:\n\n> See: **[[Proposal] Allowlist Aura Finance in Balancer VotingEscrow](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708)**\n> \n> Centered around veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters. Since Aura launched one year ago, it has played a vital role in the Balancer ecosystem. Aura is now expanding to Arbitrum and other L2s to further support Balancer.\n\n# Motivation:\n\n> The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. Aura is expanding to Arbitrum to support Balancer liquidity on L2s. auraBAL is the liquid wrap of veBAL. The approval of this gauge for the 55/45 auraBAL/wstETH pool will set up a successful launch on Arbitrum and provide liquidity for auraBAL. The 55/45 weight of the pool will facilitate trading and help generate more trading fees and wstETH yield for liquidity providers and the Balancer protocol, along with other core pools on Arbitrum.\n> \n> A summary and description of Aura’s intended Arbitrum deployment can be found in [[AIP-31] Arbitrum Deployment](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-31-arbitrum-deployment/504).\n> \n> The auraBAL tokens bridged to Arbitrum can be deposited into the Arbitrum auraBAL vault and benefit from auto compounding rewards, similar to Mainnet.\n> \n> All auraBAL deposited into the mainnet bridge contract (AuraBalProxyOFT) will be staked in the mainnet auraBAL vault earning yield. This yield will be periodically harvested and distributed to the sidechains. This enables an opportunity for a leverage APR based on a ratio of bridged to staked auraBAL on those supporting chains.\n\n# Specifications:\n\n > ## 1. Governance - \n> Aura is governed by the vlAura community with Snapshot as its voting platform. Aura recently adopted [AIP-27](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-27-implement-weighted-voting-for-aura/469) to enable weighted veBAL voting following Balancer’s adoption of [BIP-300](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-300-change-snapshot-to-weighted-voting/4771). It’s in the process of [expanding its delegate base](https://forum.aura.finance/t/information-about-delegates/488).\n>\n     >    * Treasury multisig (4/7): [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/eth:0xfc78f8e1Af80A3bF5A1783BB59eD2d1b10f78cA9/home)\n   > \n   > \n   >    * Protocol multisig (4/7): [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x5feA4413E3Cc5Cf3A29a49dB41ac0c24850417a0)\n> \n> \n>    * [Protocol multisig rights](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/governance/multisig-rights)\n> \n> \n>    * [Protocol and treasury multisig composition](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/governance/multisig-composition) and see [AIP-8 ](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-8-multi-sig-best-practices-framework/142)and [AIP-16](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-16-multisig-performances-updates/220)\n> \n> ## 2. Oracles - \n>  Aura does not rely on external oracles.\n> ## 3. Audits: \n> See https://docs.aura.finance/security.\n> \n> ## 4. Centralization vectors:\n> Aura is a non-custodial, non-pausable platform. The only centralization vectors pertain to off-chain Snapshot voting and the two 4/7 multisigs.\n> \n> ## 5. Market History - \n> auraBAL is now a year old. auraBAL’s main liquidity is on Balancer on Ethereum. The two pools, auraBAL Stable (50/50 auraBAL/80BAL20wETH) and 33 auraBAL (33/33/33 graviAURA, auraBAL, wETH), currently have over $22,000,000 of combined liquidity. These two will still exist on Mainnet, while this pool will serve as the primary source of liquidity for auraBAL on Arbitrum.\n>\n>    * auraBAL’s historic performance in relation to 80BAL20wETH is available at https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/balancer.\n> ## 6. Value - \n> Arbitrum already has over $11mm in wstETH/wETH liquidity that will promote swapping between auraBAL, wETH, and wstETH. In addition to providing aurabAL liquidity on Arbitrum, pairing auraBAL with wstETH 55/45 should help to further enhance the core pool incentives on Arbitrum. \n>    * A separate Temp Check will soon be posted to the Aura forum and will be contingent on this BIP passing Balancer governance. The Temp Check/AIP will seek to modify [AIP-26](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-26-optimize-aura-eth-and-aurabal-stable-incentives-to-maximize-protocol-benefit/463) by re-allocating from that AIP's prior allocations, for at leaset 10 gauge cycles, each of  ~7.5k of Aura, to be used for this pool in the manner authorized by the AIP (and on HH's Aura market on Arbitrum once launched by HH), with the remaining Aura for each cycle to be used per the parameters of AIP-26.\n\n> \n> [Pool link](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc7fa3a3527435720f0e2a4c1378335324dd4f9b3000200000000000000000459)\n> \n> [Gauge address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x175407b4710b5a1cb67a37c76859f17fb2ff6672): `0x175407b4710b5A1cB67a37C76859F17fb2ff6672`\n> \n> \n> Subject to 2% emission cap.\n\n> **Transaction Specification:**\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x175407b4710b5A1cB67a37C76859F17fb2ff6672`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
