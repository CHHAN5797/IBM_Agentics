        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Arbitrum assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. \n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, WETH, USDC, and DAI on V3 Arbitrum, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a negligible effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$510,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.25.49 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiedmb5tco5hbmc4yhosleztoqgzcxr73764wjmkaixl5nnifj7gtm)\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.14 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiftwqqxkoyfunfkw5c7evs7l43nvw5rpw5pf22ritq6hnng5lisgq)\n\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.25 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreieg5hp7sxuypizbnkhpxl3g24iictd2kowldwcdw3tx4qpzxsjpn4)\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-16 at 11.33.36 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreicc75b27co2nqaglgol5ikam6hymu7ozpufcsek53aolhdn5nqt3a)\n    \n### Liquidity and Position Analysis:\n\nGenerally, the TVL in Aave on Arbitrum (98M$) compared to the overall chain trading volume (~$142M /daily over the past three months) should allow on-chain liquidity sources to absorb liquidations across the Arbitrum positions. \n\n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.50.40 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreibnq7cnifmja4fdykrvzlq7q427q64rqtz4e3x3i5m6zyqyxophia)\n\n ![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.51.28 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreif2xf6f4t3a3fogjhgl2eefna5hbkhv5zvjlkekkdfnx7k3hjq3sy)\n*Source: [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/arbitrum)*\n\nAs a result, Aave protocol on Arbitrum is expected to experience very low bad debt, even in extreme market conditions, across most assets. Specifically, the current values of LT and LTV for multiple assets can be safely increased to improve capital efficiency at a very low or no additional bad debt risk due to price volatility. This assumption is backed by simulation sweeps across a large range of values, measuring low Extreme Value-at-Risk (P99 bad debt) value even as LT is increased significantly.  \n\n**WETH and WBTC**\n\nWe have not identified any “whale” positions or activity affecting our recommendations.\n\n**USDC**\n\nWe have identified two large positions that supply ~45% of USDC on Arbitrum. One of these wallets does not borrow against its $7.63M USDC position. \n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.36.20 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreifnwr76cat73zfoqygefsjw5dfyricuy4znggigvx65dj6suv6x7u)\n    \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.36.03 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreia5422d6c6kdhqxo4lbbqotplearpaugv2uysgidnfevvdiekla3q)\n    \nEven in the event of a change in the borrow usage (increasing disproportionately), the on-chain liquidity for USDC on Arbitrum should support its liquidation potential. \n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.43.03 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreiffkksbpbhxapmdbyjqt4ubr5tkl7f27nrhmxsdkj7g3duh5fwkje)\n    \n**DAI**\n\nWe have identified one large position which supplies ~40% of DAI on Arbitrum and does not currently borrow against the position. \n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 10.48.20 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreibtw255axxfnmb2yc5dqbld7rd4ont2l5rel3wkkitwiir6znquqi)\n    \nEven in the event of a change in the borrow usage (increasing disproportionately), the on-chain liquidity on Arbitrum should be able to support its liquidation potential. \n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-20 at 11.06.52 AM (1).png](ipfs://bafkreidlqlkcfbf2v7e3baohwcljewz2pcr2npy65igecywzkrdls4f2oq)\n    \n### Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec| Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WETH | Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 85% | +2.5% |\n| WETH | Loan-to-Value | 80% | 82.5% | +2.5% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 7% | -3% |\n| DAI | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 82% | +2% |\n| DAI | Loan-to-Value | 75% | 77% | +2% |\n| USDC | Liquidation Threshold | 85% | 86% | +1% |\n| USDC | Loan-to-Value | 80% | 81% | +1% | \n\n    \n \n    ",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\nA proposal to adjust four (4) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across two (2) Aave V3 Avalanche assets.\n\n## Motivation\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different configurations of Aave V3 risk parameters would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt.\n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the search range to ±3% change for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters in cases the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\n#### Increase LTs + LTVs (WAVAX and LINK.e)\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WAVAX and LINK.e, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a minor effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n## Recommendations:\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recomm. | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WAVAX | Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WAVAX | Loan-to-Value | 65% | 68% | +3% |\n| LINK.e | Liquidation Threshold | 65% | 68% | +3% |\n| LINK.e | Loan-to-Value | 50% | 53% | +3% |",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across one (1) Aave V2 asset. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of recommendations follows [AIP 117](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=117) to further de-risk the REN market. \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ktXGW6P.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zoCKkVn.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xO974Ct.png)\n\n**Price changes of key assets since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9D7yUOW.png)\n\n**Time series of Value at Risk (VaR) since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R8enrDr.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and percentage of total REN supplies:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m3qrkWx.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and borrow usages:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CNBpVd8.png)\n\n**Entire supply positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rMEczds.png)\n\n**Entire borrow positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HEKWdu8.png)\n\n\nBelow, Gauntlet analyzes the user which contributes the most Value at Risk per our simulations.\n\nUser: `0x364d5077c4c6bce6280705fe657fc4c55fdac363`\n\n**User supply breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QZW65gh.png)\n\n**Relevant collateral factors**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nOdid9p.png)\n\n**User borrowing power breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xsPK0i7.png)\n\n**User borrows breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1Tz7Anr.png)\n\n**User borrow usage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Tnwhl0a.png)\n\nNote that this user has been elastic as of late, updating their token positions often.\n\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\nThese parameter recommendations reflect the unique situation of REN in the current market conditions.  \n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **REN Liquidation Threshold**     | 65%     | ***60%***     |\n| **REN Loan To Value**     | 60%     | ***55%***     |\n\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 11/16/2022, the data shows that only one dust account, `0x0e1337ea2c604f9a937d2623af206cdd02167b38` would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This account has a total of ~$100 in supply.\n\nThis could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-11-21\n\n## Quick Links\n[Analytics Dashboard](https://metabase.gauntlet.network/public/dashboard/f4930651-29be-4ff3-b664-a34462e286c5)\n[Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave)\n[Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc)\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) \n\nGauntlet launched an insolvency refund for Aave that contains a portion of our payment stream that can be clawed back in the event of insolvencies due to market risk. Since our last recommendation there have been no new insolvencies in Aave. Gauntlet’s Insolvency Refund vault is still live and can be seen here [0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for one (1) asset on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of a [series of proposals](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897) ([AIP-136](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/136/), [AIP-137](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/137/)) intended to reduce the viability of different attack vectors on V2 assets.\n\nAt Chaos Labs, we continuously monitor markets and utilize our [Asset Protection Tool](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-asset-protection-tool) to assess potential attack vectors on the protocol and suggest parameter and configuration updates accordingly (Supply/Borrow Caps, Liquidation Threshold updates, freezing of assets, listing in isolation mode, etc.)\n\nCapital efficiency reductions on V2 assets will further mitigate attack vectors by increasing the capital required to wage a price manipulation attack on Aave. In addition, these changes will act as an effective motivation to shift usage to V3, where users can enjoy the benefits of enhanced risk mitigation mechanisms.\n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. To minimize this impact, we suggest reaching the desired settings by **a series of incremental decreases**, following the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nTo avoid liquidations, Chaos Labs will communicate the planned amendments before their on-chain execution via all available avenues (Twitter, forums, [Nansen Connect](https://connect.nansen.ai/), and [Blockscan Chat](https://chat.blockscan.com/)).\n\nBelow, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users.\n\nAt the time of this proposal, none of the current positions will be eligible for liquidation due to the proposed change.\n\n**$MKR**\n- Zero (0) accounts are eligible for liquidation.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n|Asset|Parameter|Current| Rec.|Change|\n|---| --- | ---| --- | ---  |\n| MKR | Liquidation Threshold |67%| 64%| -3% |\n| MKR | Loan-to-Value | 62%| 59%| -3%|",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust twelve (12) total risk parameters across eight (8) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nIn addition, we propose to enable utilizing FEI as a collateral on Aave. The initial parameters for FEI will be an LTV of 50%, a Liquidation Threshold of 60%, and a Liquidation Bonus of 6.5%. Most of the stablecoins that can be used as collateral are more liquid, and our platform's analysis recommends initially capping the amount of collateral that can be liquidatable to the average daily trading volume. If user behavior and market conditions over the coming months continue to show safe conditions for increasing capital efficiency on FEI, we shall recommend ramping up the LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus incrementally.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |\n| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |\n| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |\n| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |\n| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |\n| FEI Loan To Value    | 0%     | 50%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 0%     | 60%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Bonus    | 0%     | 6.5%     |\n| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |\n| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q8uyBaE.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-01-18",
