        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n### **Author:  @Ethan - Threshold Network Growth Coordinator**\n\n### **Date: 2024-04-24**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\nThe proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.\n\n## Motivation/Background:\n\ntBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum's Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.\n\nHaving recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).\n\nBenefits for Aave:\n\n* Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.\n* A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n* Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.\n* Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n* Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium's LTIPP.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\nContract Addresses:\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nEthereum: 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\nOptimism: 0x5a61374950D4BFa5a3D4f2CA36FC1d23A92b6f21\n\nUseful Links (the number of posted links is limited to 5 for new users, hence the intended spacing between \"h\" and \"ttps\"):\n\nProject: h ttps://www.threshold.network/\n\nMinting dashboard: h ttps://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint\n\nGitHub: h ttps://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2\n\nDocs: h ttps://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2\n\nAudit: h ttps://threshold.network/about#audits\n\nImmunfi Bug Bounty: h ttps://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\nLlama Risk Report: https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/tBTC\n\nTwitter: h ttps://twitter.com/thetnetwork\n\nDiscord: h ttps://discord.gg/threshold\n\nDune: h ttps://dune.com/threshold/tbtc & h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n\n#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThreshold Network has no link and is not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal.\n\n#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by native BTC. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for native BTC without a centralized custodian. It can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\ntBTC can be used as collateral, liquidity, a store of value, and can be integrated with DeFi apps across all supported blockchains.\n\nAs with other BTC wrappers, tBTC provides cryptocurrency traders and general users with a BTC-pegged token, that can be used to generate yield whilst holding native BTC.\n\n#### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nAdding support for tBTC on Aave V3 as an asset would allow tBTC holders to obtain a yield on their tBTC holdings.\n\nIn Aave’s [document hub](https://docs.aave.com/hub/), the first line self-describes Aave as “a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol”, Threshold Network is looking to help Aave fully realise this by allowing access to tBTC, which unlike its centralized competitor (wBTC), is the only way to permissionlessly borrow and lend BTC in a decentralized manner. This gives Aave direct access to the 1.3 trillion market and 106 million owners of BTC, for which wBTC provides limited access to.\n\n#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n#### How is tBTC currently used?\n\ntBTC is currently used across the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon and Solana ecosystems. tBTC exhibits strong usecase across decentralized exchanges, lending on Solana and Bitcoin Options on Base and as collateral for crvUSD, a broad overview can be found here:\nhttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\n\n#### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation\n\nThe Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:\n\nCouncil Multisig Ethereum Address: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\n#### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $195,000,000 USD / 2,960 BTC\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools: h ttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\nDashboard on Decentralized LP liquidity: h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n#### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 7,251\nTwitter: 37,200\nGithub: 4,596 commits\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of Deployment: February 2023\nNumber of transactions: 27,986\nNumber of token holders: 756\n\n#### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams, we suggest the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nSymbol: TBTC\n\nContract Addresses\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|N/A|\n|Borrow Cap|2 Million USD|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|35%|\n|LT|78%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Threshold Network.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard ggAVAX to Aave V3 on Avalanche \nDate: 2024-04-29\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe current proposal is set to add ggAVAX, a liquid staking AVAX token issued by the Gogopool protocol, to the AAVE V3 Avalanche market.\n\n### Motivation\n\nGoGoPool is one of the largest Avalanche DeFi protocols. It is ranked number 6 on the Avalanche C-Chain in terms of TVL chain and currently controls more than 500k AVAX (~$23M at current market prices).\n\nWe believe there is currently very large underserved demand for borrowing AVAX against ggAVAX, as ggAVAX is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche. The APYs currently range between 7% and 8%, which is on the order of 33% more yield than any existing competitors on Avalanche. \n\nBeing the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche makes ggAVAX perfect for being a collateral asset, especially for those who seek leveraged exposure to native AVAX yields.\n\n \n![dd93fbd27bc1aac727035529eb5ff6253f57edc8.png](ipfs://bafkreibcfworgked4rc5maanvobvklqy6rmwchfk7rjyoswvyd2chpzsbu)\n    \n\n\nThis yield is achieved through a mix of no protocol fees, running validators instead of utilizing delegation mechanisms, and generating MEV yield from positive market interactions (see dashboard for more details: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK)). \n\nThere is currently more than ~80k AVAX in the ggAVAX-AVAX pools across Balancer and Wombat, making it the most liquid Avalanche LST relative to its size.\n\n \n![8867ec44b2d0dc326eaf4b928b7d7c889eb5f113.png](ipfs://bafkreig3f2xualvcqedjubvgg66tj3jwfkccocvm53l5dc5xtmmo6r5px4)\n    \n\n\nBesides the deep on-chain liquidity, ggAVAX allows users to redeem ggAVAX for underlying AVAX at an internal rate and with no fees. These redemptions are instant as long as there is enough AVAX in the ggAVAX smart contract to facilitate them.\n\nGoGoPool is backed by the Avalanche Foundation and industry-leading investors. In 2022, It raised $7.5M in two rounds [led by Framework Ventures and Coinfund and](https://www.theblock.co/post/166498/gogopool-raises-5-million-to-provide-decentralized-staking-on-avalanche?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) with participation from Silverstone Ventures, Fintech Collective, and Avalaunch. \n\nThe protocol has been [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/GoGoPool%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Kudelski Security](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f90a8443126c2ee50f4c4e/643ee88bf91b375b39ba2613_Kudelski_multisig_labs_report_1.1.pdf) with an additional [Code4rena](https://docs.gogopool.com/audits/code4rena-audit) audit contest. It also has an ongoing [bug bounty program with Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/gogopool/).\n\n### Benefits of listing ggAVAX\n\nListing of ggAVAX on AAVE would create additional demand for borrowing AVAX (in E-Mode) and other assets. Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.\n\nCurrently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nAave V3 on Avalanche.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWith the recent implementation of [Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51), ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed. This is the same approach that AAVE currently uses for sAVAX, wstETH, cbETH, weETH and other LSTs (and LRTs)\n\nggAVAX’s CAPO, however, might require a max growth ratio higher than the 10.1% currently set for sAVAX to account for a generally higher level of yield.\n\nWe welcome any questions about ggAVAX architecture and protocol structure and look forward to working on this with the DAO.\n\n### Specification\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (ggAVAX)|70,000|\n|Borrow Cap (ggAVAX)|NA|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|\n|LTV|30.00%|\n|LT|40.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|NA|\n|Variable Slope2|NA|\n|Uoptimal|NA|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|Emode|No|\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments\n\nGoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.\n\nAfter the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults. \n\nThese and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general. Note that we have already had preliminary talks with a number of protocols on this subject.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://www.gogopool.com/) \n\n[Github](https://github.com/multisig-labs/)\n\n[Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK) \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogopool_)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gogopool.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n**Title:** [ARFC] Onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Ethereum\n**Author:** Ether.fi & ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n**Date:** 2024-02-27\n\n---\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe current ARFC seeks to add [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) Liquid Restaking Token weETH to Aave V3 Ethereum, after the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546) and [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e).\n\nThe intention behind this initiative is to enhance the diversity of assets on Aave and bolster liquidity within the ecosystem.\n\n### Motivation:\n\neETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi 1](http://ether.fi/) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) stands as the pioneering decentralized and non-custodial delegated staking protocol featuring an LRT (eETH). A notable feature of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is the control it provides stakers over their keys. The team behind the protocol is guided by the following principles:\n\n1. Decentralization is the foremost objective. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is unwavering in its commitment to maintain the protocol's non-custodial and decentralized nature, ensuring that stakers always have control over their ETH.\n2. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) operates as a legitimate business with a sustainable revenue model, with the team dedicated to its long-term success. There is no place for deceptive or unsustainable financial practices.\n3. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is committed to always acting in the best interest of the Ethereum community. In the event of any missteps, the team at [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) will take responsibility and swiftly rectify the situation.\n\nRisks:\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)  and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.\n\nUsers are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. \n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nweETH: [0xCd5fE23C85820F7B72D0926FC9b05b43E359b7ee](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcd5fe23c85820f7b72d0926fc9b05b43e359b7ee)\n\n| Risk Parameters | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (weETH) | 8000 |\n| Borrow Cap (weETH) | 800 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72.50% |\n| LT | 75.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-correlated |\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n[Ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546)\n\n[TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Frax Finance has in the past done so in Aave v2 on Ethereum and has already stated on the Aave governance forum an interest in doing so on other deployments once FRAX is added.\n\nThe Frax Finance team could deploy a similar Aave Lending AMOs to Aave v3 after FRAX is listed.This will provide Aave users with access to FRAX and present an alternative to the four USD stable coins on Aave v3.\n\nUsers are able to borrow FRAX and earn yield across DeFi, such as on Curve Finance and Convex Finance.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?**\n\nThere is no link between the authors and the core teams of the asset.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token ?**\n\nSee summary.\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nFRAX is a popular stablecoin to borrow, with its Lending AMOs it is able to mint protocol-owned FRAX to ensure low interest rates.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nFRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.\n\n**5. How is the FRAX token currently used ?**\n\nFRAX is a popular stablecoin to borrow, with its Lending AMOs it is able to mint protocol-owned FRAX to ensure low interest rates.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nFRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.\n\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nThere is a multisig which can operate certain AMO contracts but cannot in any way change users’ FRAX balances, cannot freeze or pause any user’s funds, and cannot in any way alter the behavior of the protocol or sweep/rug collateral or value. There are no FRAX whitelists/blacklists in any capacity as it is entirely a bearer asset/decentralized exactly like DAI.\n\n**8.
