        "body": "**Summary:**\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll testnet.\n\n**Proposal TL;DR:**\nAave has been trailblazing DeFi since inception and continues to embrace new frontiers and innovation to this day. The protocol has become a dominant player in DeFi lending across networks - be it alt L1s or L2s. Scroll wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and propose to the Aave community to authorize the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll testnet.\n\nZk rollups are widely considered to be the holy grail of Ethereum scaling. Recent breakthroughs have allowed the space to mature much faster than originally anticipated 1, which has positioned Scroll to build the next generation of scaling solutions that has achieved:\n\n- bytecode compatibility with the EVM: No new languages, tooling, trust in custom architecture or re-audits needed. Aave will be able to port over its codebase instantly and seamlessly without any extra engineering resources required.\n- top-tier security through process and architecture: Scroll has been open-sourced from day one and has been designed to prioritize the decentralization of its prover and sequencer networks, making it unique in the zk rollup space.\n- pushing boundaries of cutting edge research: Establishing a presence on Scroll will allow Aave to capture the zkEVM market in advance and reap L2 native innovation from the start and even contribute to steering how L2 user behavior will evolve short and long-term.\n\nGenerally, we believe that Aave’s community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit or location. In the following we detail Scroll’s architecture and mission and how it will benefit the Aave community. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the community’s questions.\n\n**About Scroll**\nScroll 1 is a native zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent zk rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security.\n\nEVM equivalence & Developer Friendliness: Anything less than bytecode level compatibility is an unnecessary risk that protocols should not settle for. We don’t think developers should have to learn a new language or trust custom architecture which introduces unknown risk. Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure and will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously.\n- Community first: Scroll originated in close collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community for the community! That also means that Scroll has been peer reviewed and open source from day one. We intend to follow this strategy going forward. We will foster community innovation and participate in the incubation of new open source tools and features for the L2 space. We intend to be the #1 platform for developers and we are working with the best to achieve this (Ethereum Foundation (PSE), 0xparc, zcash, Filecoin, and many more).\n- Decentralization & Security: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is committed to outsource proof generation. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem. In addition to that Scroll has a strong in-house security team that found and reported bugs in fellow zk RU’s proving systems in the past.\n- Education & Research: We pride ourselves in making research accessible to all. We continuously publish research in an effort to demystify the inner works of zk circuits (see https://scroll.io/blog and our public zk reading group). Scroll has been able to establish a recognized and sought after brand within a short amount of time which is also due to event series like Rollup Day which was appreciated across the board of L2 industry leaders.\n- Advance Ethereum’s ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereum’s ultimate goal of “zkSNARK Everything” . Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum!\n\nWe are live on testnet and our ecosystem is rapidly growing. Since the beginning of January 2023 our testnet has seen over 900k unique wallet addresses, and this month we’ve averaged over 500k transactions a day — all helping to test the robustness of our network. We have been working with major infrastructure players (including the Graph, Safe, Covalent, Orbiter, and many more) to add support for critical building blocks on the network, and we’re working with best-in-class Ethereum dApps to join the network too (including Uniswap v3 on Scroll testnet).\n\n**Aave on Scroll**\nBy launching on testnet, Aave has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with lending protocols such as Aave. Aave is a uniquely important DeFi lender in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that a zk L2 affords.\n\nWe are only at the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum Layer 1 as of now (e.g. going beyond flashloans with atomic (cross zk-RU) txs in a post-Danksharding Ethereum and further use cases we’d love to co-develop). Scroll is incentivizing developers globally to break frontiers by funding research grants, hosting educational workshops and continuously making cutting edge research publicly available. We are excited to help foster an ecosystem fuelled by creativity that revolves around Aave and the distribution of $GHO.\n\n**Bridge Security**\nZk rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography, rather than unreliable crypto-economics.\n\nCurrently, Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than classical relayer-based bridges.\n\nSecurity is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we have an in-house security team working with 10+ external auditors who keep a close eye on the security of our codebase.\n\n**Timeline**\nThe Scroll team will first submit the necessary snapshots for deploying Aave v3 on our testnet, following the community guidelines and working with BDG Labs on what is required. The current testnet already supports the deployment of contracts. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is very easy to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take 2-3 weeks and we commit to dedicating engineering resources to support the Aave integrations team.\n\nIt is important to us to be closely in touch with the Aave community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment.\n\n**References**\nScroll Github: https://github.com/scroll-tech/\nScroll Testnet Docs: https://guide.scroll.io/\nBlock Explorer: https://l2scan.scroll.io/blocks\nBlog Posts: https://scroll.io/blog\n\n**Technicalities**\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Our nodes expose all standard geth APIs, but Erigon’s. We do not have support for trace_* endpoints, but currently maintain scroll_* that could be adapted if required.\n- Indexers: Covalent is currently indexing our network and we do have theGraph support\n- Oracles: we have a number of oracle providers deployed on our testnet such Redstone as well as Witnet and working with Chainlink to have immediate mainnet support\n- Being bytecode-compatible, Scroll works out-of-the-box with all Solidity tooling. (See here)\n- Wallets: we do have Safe, Ledger, Coinbase wallet and Metamask support (and working with many aa wallets such as Soulwallet and others)\nAddress formatting: Scroll has the exact same address formatting than Ethereum",

        "body": "From the Aave Governance forum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/request-for-approval-aave-starkware-phase-i/7145)\n\n## Background\nThe discussion about Aave on Starknet [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploying-aave-on-starknet/6726).\n\n\n## Introduction\nA proposal to start bootstrapping the Aave ecosystem over Starkware has received good support from the Aave community, as it allows to expand to a new and promising environment, following the lead of Aave v3 with rollups.\n\nThis bootstrapping was proposed to be executed in 2 phases: an initial one getting in touch with the new technology, while still building something valuable for the Aave and Starknet communities; and a second one, more ambitious, most probably porting Aave v3 to Starknet.\n\nAs the facilitator of the project, I outline on this document the details of Phase I, including scope, time estimation, team members and budget allocation request from the Aave DAO.\n\n\n## Phase I. Scope\n\n### The project. aTokens bridge\nAs explained on the initial post, the target of the initial Phase is simplicity, while adding value for the communities.\n\nOne of the options was to create some kind of pooling model, for people to deposit and withdraw from Aave Ethereum without ever touching Ethereum and its (current) high gas cost. Since that initial proposal, the idea has been refined together with the built team.\n\nPhase I will pursue the same goals as the original pooling idea, but this will be done by building wrappers and smart contracts around the canonical Starknet bridges, for the aTokens of Aave Ethereum. Following similar idea as pioneered by Aavegotchi with maTokens, together with some extra bridging infrastructure on both the Ethereum and Starknet sides, this model will allow to:\n\nBuild the basic blocks for products to integrate easily with Aave from Starknet. Including smart contracts and interaction libraries.\nSolve some interesting and useful challenges, like cross-chain liquidity mining.\nBoost Starknet’s user base, by providing Aave facilities.\nKeep simplicity.\nIn terms of user flow, the system will provide smart contracts infrastructure to:\n\nUsers entering on Starknet via CEXes or on-ramp services to deposit on Aave Ethereum, just by buying an aToken equivalent on Starknet.\nSame for withdrawals, by selling the aToken equivalent on Starknet.\nNew opportunities to liquidity providers to build on top of that, potentially monetising the movement of liquidity between Ethereum and Starknet.\n\n\n### Timeline\nThe project is estimated to take a total of 2 to 3 months, with the variability depending on the implementation of the most experimental aspects, like the cross-chain liquidity mining.\n\nAs part of the facilitator role, I will post bi-weekly updates on the state of the project, informing the community on the progress on all aspects.\n\nA more detailed timeline is the following:\n![Timeline](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/7edbf24a3327584d6bdd5a4da617a801dfd85ba8.jpeg)\n\nThe project start will be marked by the execution of the on-chain proposal requesting the initial funds of the project.\n\n### Team\nSince the initial proposal, multiple teams showed interest on participating on the project. Considering the final scope, the team will be formed by:\n\n- 1 facilitator of the project, part-time.\n- 1 frontend/backend developer, part-time.\n- 3 Cairo/Solidity developers, full-time.\n- 1 Solidity developer part-time (depending on availability and need).\n- **Total**: 3 full time and 2-3 part time.\nThe team is balanced to have expertise on the Aave ecosystem and Starknet.\n\n### Budget breakdown\nSalaries. Covering the full scope of the project, estimated for 3 months and to not be modified unless the final timeline is too short (>1.5 month less) or too long (>1.5 month long).\nGas cost. For deployments of contracts, plus all managerial efforts concerning mainly the payments from the Aave DAO.\nAudit. We plan to engage 2 audit firms, both with EVM/Solidity expertise and at least one with Starknet/Cairo experience.\nBug bounty. Maximum to be spent, but most probably over-estimated if no important issues are found.\nBuffer. 10% of the total budget.\n![budget](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/7fc0a6a7abe4bdc0d0b7295ac8bf002d7dd299fa.png)\n\n\n### Payments\nFor the Starkware part, the payments will be managed as coordinated between the Starknet team, the facilitator and the team members.\n\nFor the Aave part, 2 payments are proposed, to be requested via proposals on the Aave governance:\n\nAt the start of the project, 100’000$ to cover mainly fixed expenses.\nBefore starting audits (beginning Month 3), $92’500.\nAny reconciliation of budget (e.g. return unused funds) will be done at the end of the project, with the bug bounty being kept by the team during 1 year, and then returned to the governance if not used.\n\nGiven the nature of the development, the payment will be done on stable assets from the Aave treasury.\n\n### Deliverables\nSmart contracts (Ethereum/Starknet) for wrapping and bridging of aTokens, fully open source and with a permissive license like MIT.\nFull documentation of the codebase, architecture and model in general.\nPublic audits.\nContinuous update to the community about the project.\n\n### Next steps\n- This Snapshot proposal to ratify the project.\n- If passed, create on-chain proposal to request the initial funds.\n- Start the project development.",

        "body": "FranklinDAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) is creating this proposal in partnership with Matter Labs to Deploy Aave V3 on zkSync 2.0 Testnet \n\nProposal link: https://governance.aave.com/t/deploy-aave-v3-on-zksync-v2-0-testnet/10340 \n\n**Summary**\n\nTo support Aave’s multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Aave V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community.\n\nThe zkSync team will submit a snapshot to launch Aave V3 on ZkSync V2 testnet, and thereafter another snapshot for mainnet (when the criteria for DEX liquidity and other items are met).\n\nzkSync ecosystem has over 200 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.\nDeploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Aave by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation\nzkSync shares Ethereum’s ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership\n\n**About zkSync**\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a [ZK rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.\nzkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:\nEVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps\nToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools\nEthos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source\nCertainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability\nFuture Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code\nThere is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSync’s EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.\n\n**References**\n\n- Matter Labs Github: [Matter Labs · GitHub](https://github.com/matter-labs)\n- zkSync Homepage: https://zksync.io/\n- zkSync 2.0 Testnet Docs: [zkSync Documentation | zkSync: secure, scalable crypto payments](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/)\n- Blog Posts: https://blog.matter-labs.io/ \n- zkSync Mainnet Alpha Registration: [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdXAoQiHLu16ykEoOb762uvC1bAhdzOG-YDk6ju0YwPWf3Fw/viewform)\n\n\n**Technicalities**\n\n- Solidity/Vyper support; recommended to use ^0.8.0 and Vyper ^0.3.3 [details](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/developer-guides/contracts/contracts.html#solidity-vyper-support) \n- RPC is public: We fully support the Ethereum JSON API, with some additions for L2-level features.

A timely assessment of the deployment of Aave v3 code to zkSync is important: our team has already tested the smart contract library (mostly key ones) it was compiling and looked like it was working fine.\n\n**Proposal Stages:**\n\nThe zkSync team will first submit a snapshot for testnet deployment, following the community guidelines.\nThen when the time comes, another snapshot for mainnet (when the criteria for DEX liquidity and other items are met)\n\n**Authors:**\n\nzkSync team",

        "body": "Deploy Aave on Cronos chain\n\nThe following proposal follows the ARC draft proposal posted for comments [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploy-aave-v3-on-cronos-chain/7287), more than 5 days ago, that follows the standard governance process framework.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nLaunched in 2021 after years of open-source R&D, Cronos is #9 public blockchain by DeFi value locked according to  [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chains)  (around 2.5 B$ TVL to date). Cronos proposes to deploy Aave V3 to the Cronos chain and to incentivize liquidity in order to help fulfill the promise of a multi-chain future.\n\nCronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. An open-source Layer 1 chain launched under the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  umbrella, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp (Web3) user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos, the majority via a centralized exchange. Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project: as [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  customers, as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem, and/or as [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  project supporters. These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3. For them, Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of self-custody, Ethereum and DeFi.\n\nThe cross-chain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3, resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users. Therefore, Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3.\n\n**Technical specifications of the network**\n\n*Network specifications*\n\n[Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/)  is an open-source project launched by  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  that brings together many  [open-source initiatives](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/blob/main/go.mod#L22)  of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).\n\nCronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called  [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/charts)  , as well as on  [Defillama for TVL data](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos)  .\n\nAt the protocol level, Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validator’s voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocol’s staking token. There are currently 26 live validators, with room for more. The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds, low transaction fees (usually below 1 USD) paid in CRO token, and small environmental footprint.\n\nUsers and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSON-RPC  [endpoints](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  . They can deploy any EVM-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, and can use all the usual end-user and developer tooling: MetaMask, Etherscan block explorer ([Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/) ), Gnosis Safe, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.\n\nThe Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations, specifically the Chainlink oracle, The Graph indexer, and commercial and JSON-RPC endpoints for Dapps (in addition to the existing  [free ones](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  ). These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project. A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022. Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects.\n\nThere are several bridges between Cronos and other networks :\n\n* [Live] Fast withdrawals from and to the  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  app and exchange.\n* [Upcoming] Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology, currently in testing and planned for imminent launch.\n* [Live] IBC transfers from and to the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  chain, Cosmos Hub, and Terra, with more IBC-compatible chains on the roadmap.\n* [Live] EVM smart contract-based transfers from and to BSC, Polygon, and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges, with more to come.\n* Security review of additional bridges is under way.\n\nCronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  [contributors](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  ,  [validators](https://cronos.crypto.org/partners)  , and  [Dapp developers](https://cronos.crypto.org/ecosystem)  . This includes 2 large AMM/DEXes, VVS Finance (1.4 B$ TVL) and MM Finance (320 M$ TVL).\n\nThe  [roadmap](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254)  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations, further connectivity and interoperability, best-in-class tooling and infrastructure, further protocol governance decentralization, dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps, and longer term plans to increase scalability.\n\n*Aave V3 implementation*\n\nAs part of this proposal, Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol, given that Cronos is fully EVM-compatible. Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer (implementation under way).\n\nThe Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVM-based cross-chain bridges (such as Connext and others, subject to further testing and security review) for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens.\n\n*Metrics and references*\n\nChain data as of Feb 15, 2022:\n* 26 live validators.\n* 15+ M transactions to date (no transaction pumping!)\n* 150,000 to 200,000 transactions per day, with potential to increase by 5x to 20x in the short term.\n* 350,000 unique wallets.\n* More than 120 Dapps deployed in the last 3 months, including VVS (DEX, 1.4 B$ TVL), MM Finance (DEX, 320 M$ TVL), Tectonic (decentralized lending, 275 M$ TVL), and others.\n\nAudience data\n*  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cronos_chain)  : 130k followers.\n*  [Telegram](https://t.me/Cryptoorg_Chain_Announcements)  : 7k subscribers.\n*  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pahqHz26q4)  : 19,000 members.\n\nLinks\n*  [Cronos website](https://cronos.crypto.org/) \n*  [Particle B ecosystem development program](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-ecosystem-grants-7a4a2de3b721) \n*  [Blockchain explorer](https://cronoscan.com/) \n*  [Particle B accelerator](https://www.particleb.com/) \n*  [Cronos integration documentation](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html) \n*  [Github](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  repository\n*  [Overview of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/nodes/)  node architecture\n\n**Proposed list of initial collaterals**\n\nThe proposed list of initial collaterals is: CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, ATOM, LUNA, DOT.\n\nAs indicated above, Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment.\n\nCronos already supports the  [following cross-chain assets](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#integration-guide-for-cronos-mainnet-beta)  : CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, SHIB, DOGE, ATOM, LINK, ENJ, ELON, TUSD, LUNA, DOT, BIFI, with more to come. Additional native tokens include VVS, TONIC. These tokens have between 10 M$ and 700 M$ of liquidity on Cronos. Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M$.\n\nThe proposed tokens have more than, or close to, 2 M$ daily volume each. With respect to DEX statistics, see  [VVS analytics](https://vvs.finance/info)  for history and liquidity per token.\n\n**Incentives**\n\nParticle B, the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain, has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development. A portion of these funds will be allocated to end-user incentives, commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos.\n\nIn our experience, the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions, hence the exact programs and amounts (expected to be worth several M$) will need to be refined over time.\n\n**Audits and security**\n\nCronos mainnet was launched in November 2021 and has not experienced outages so far.\n\nAn audit of relevant components of the underlying Ethermint codebase (  [crypto](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/crypto)  ,  [JSON RPC](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/ethereum/rpc)  ,  [Ante handler](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/app)  ,  [EVM state transition](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go)  ) was commissioned by Foris Ltd and completed by Kudelski Security. It is published in the Cronos Github repository ([link](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/tree/main/docs/audit)).\n\nA bug bounty program is  [published](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/)  , with a bounty of up to 1.3 M$.\n\nThank you for your support !",

        "title": "ARC: Whitelist Connext for V3 Portals",
        "author": "0xd333Bc5c9670C9cEb18f9A2CF02C6E86807a8227",
        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to whitelist Connext, a trust minimized cross chain protocol, for V3 Portals on 6 chains: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony - with credit lines for USDC ($2m on each chain), USDT ($1m on each chain) and ETH (40 ETH on each chain).\n\n## Reasonale\n\n[Connext](https://connext.network) is a network for **fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups**. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively **cross-chain applications**.\nTo date, over $1.3b in transactions have crossed the network.\n\nOur network of liquidity providers only works with native assets, or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset.\n\nWith our [Amarok upgrade](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), a series of improvements are coming for users, developers and liquidity providers (routers): the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users, while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation, coming from the [Optimistic communication protocol Nomad](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0), is completed.\n\nUsers’ transactions get confirmed in seconds, LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service.\n\n**Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions, and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way**.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\nConnext is much more than a bridge, it’s an **interoperability protocol**: it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions.\nOne of these applications are bridges, others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals.\n\n**51 routers are currently providing $40m+ of liquidity.**\nThe highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume (and therefore higher returns) with less capital compared to other solutions in the space.\nThe system is currently working on a whitelist basis. Once the [NEXT token](https://blog.connext.network/whats-next-d3044de49397) is live, the whole network will be permissionless.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThis is an overview of the Amarok architecture that is currently on testnet and planned to go live in a few weeks:\n\n![image](ipfs://QmZVvSsU5ra6vFvMiu82iMAieP1LFuS44EjsbLJVkeUj8N)\n\nThe new flow heavily utilizes Nomad (and eventually other localized messaging layers) for its security model. Routers front capital and execute calls for a user’s transaction, and claim against funds going through Nomad.\n\n\nA full overview can be found [here](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4).\n\nThis model fits with the Aave Portals. This is how the simplified architecture integrating Portals will look like - credits to Delphi Digital for the image.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmYug4RrSW8SgjdtqQY21ALDk7gYS1HcH8mSa5Jo4v4sqk)\n\n([Development progress deep dive](https://github.com/connext/nxtp/pull/1074)).\n\nThe logic for the execute and reconcile methods for the Aave portals has been completed and is ready for audit.\n\n#### Is there a fee model for participants?\nLPs currently take a 5bps fee from every transaction\n\nAnalytics dashboard of Connext: https://connextscan.io\n\nBridge for users: https://bridge.connext.network\n\nTechnical documentation: https://docs.connext.network\n\n## Proposed list Credit Line request\n\nThe credit lines are requested for the following networks where both Connext and Aave are already present.\n\nOptimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony\n\n![aave.png](ipfs://QmbxAKskwg6caRq4j9ogFUA5xUqmHSLmT8WU8mwXbJdg56)\n\nNote: Routers providers are charging 5 bps to complete cross chain transactions.\nAll outstanding loans are repaid within 60 min (avg 30 min), effectively paying a high interest rate: 0.005% / 60 min → 44% APR\n\n#### Incentives\nA Liquidity Mining program might be approved by the DAO once the NEXT token goes live.\n\n## Audits & Security\n#### List of relevant security audits of the network\n- [NXTP Audit](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2021/07/connext-nxtp-noncustodial-xchain-transfer-protocol/)\n- Amarok Audit will be published as soon as it’s available\n#### Has the Entity experienced outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks? \nNo\n\n\n# Voting\n## FOR:\n\nDO Approve Credit lines for Connext\n\n## AGAINST:\n\nDO NOT Approve Credit lines for Connext\n",
