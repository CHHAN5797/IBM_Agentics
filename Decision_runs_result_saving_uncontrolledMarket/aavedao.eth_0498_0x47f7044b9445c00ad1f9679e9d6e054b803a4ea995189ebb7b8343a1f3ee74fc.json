        "body": "## Summary \n\nThis Temp Check proposes implementing the dedicated GHO Steward as a dynamic parameter change mechanism to ensure efficient risk management and support the peg of Aave Protocol's native multi-collateral stablecoin GHO during the initial stages. \n\n## Introduction \n\nAs the Aave DAO prepares for the introduction of GHO, it is crucial for the community to consider implementing a mechanism that offers greater agility to adjust risk parameters in the initial stages of launch.  \n\nTo support the maintenance of the peg, the proposed GHO Steward multisig acts as a dynamic parameter change mechanism. It enables swift adjustments to risk parameters, in the form of scoped governance delegation, where the full governance process could potentially be time-consuming and hinder timely response to evolving circumstances.\n\nBy employing this mechanism, the Aave Protocol ensures transparency and enables flexible parameter changes through decentralized governance. This approach reinforces commitment to preserving the peg and effectively addressing market challenges that may arise upon the launch of GHO.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nThe “bucket capacity” refers to the maximum amount of GHO that can be minted by a Facilitator. The ability to adapt the bucket capacity by adjusting supply, supports stability by ensuring that available supply meets demand.\n\nThe “borrow rate” refers to the interest rate paid when borrowing GHO. The borrowing rate may also be used to support stability because of its impact on demand.\n\nYou can learn more about GHO in the docs [here](https://docs.gho.xyz/).\n\n## GHO Steward Permissions\n\nAave V3 provides a high level of granularity around permissions. Building on the concept of [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/4?u=aavecompanies), it is proposed that a dedicated GHO Steward multisig be introduced to support the initial GHO governance risk mechanism to be able to implement agile parameter changes in the form of scoped governance delegation.\n\nThe GHO Steward multisig would be 2/2 and would include the DAO’s risk providers Chaos Labs and Gauntlet.\n\nThe GHO Steward would be capable of adjusting predefined parameters, including: increasing the bucket capacity (by up to 100%) and changing the borrow rate (by up to 50 basis points in either direction) in a single change. Parameter updates could only occur once every 5 days per the parameter.\n\nIt is proposed that the GHO Steward would be deactivated 60 days after the passing of this proposal. However, the DAO can vote to renew the GHO Steward for another 60 days if deemed necessary. The DAO can also vote to remove the GHO Stewards at any time.\n\n## Governance Process\n\nThis proposal emphasizes the importance of decentralization and community involvement in the decision-making process, fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem. The GHO Risk Steward would enable agile parameter changes for GHO; however, decisions shouldn’t be made in isolation and should go through a lean governance process.\n\nThe proposed lean process is as follows:\n\n1. Proposal on the Governance Forum explaining the rationale of the proposed action.\n\n2. Snapshot requirements:\na) 24-hour duration starting from the posting of the proposal.\nb) Quorum 250,000 AAVE.\nc) A minimum of 70% of votes FOR the change.\n\n3. Change can be enacted as soon as the proposal passes Snapshot.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the GHO Steward serves as an initial agile parameter change mechanism driven by decentralized governance. It highlights the Aave Protocol's commitment to maintaining GHO stability and addressing market challenges during the launch period.\n\nWhile the proposal acknowledges the potential for a more dynamic rate-changing governance model in the future, the current framework allows the DAO to effectively manage GHO's parameters in the short term.",

        "body": "Title: [ARC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor - aFEI Holding Update \nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham \nCreated: 21-08-2022\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIn response to Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes redeeming all aFEI for FEI and exchanging it for DAI. \n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Aave DAO currently holds around 619,185.82 units of aFEI in the Ethereum Reserve Factor. Due to the uncertainty around the future of Tribe DAO and FEI, this proposal presents the community the opportunity to reduce exposure to the FEI stablecoin.  \n\nIf other lenders move to redeem aFEI for FEI before Aave DAO acts, then there is a risk that Aave DAO becomes trapped as a lender of last resort. Due to this risk, this proposal strongly encourages the DAO to redeem aFEI for FEI as an immediate priority.\n\nAfter redeeming the aFEI for FEI, risk can be further reduced by redeeming or swapping the FEI holding for a stablecoin with a more certain future. In this proposal, we suggest redeeming the FEI for DAI via the Tribe DAO Peg Stability Module which will incur a 0.03% fee.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe FEI lending market is a concentrated market with three main providers of liquidity. Tribe DAO, Aave DAO and Badger DAO make up the top three liquidity providers by providing 88.76%, 5.47% and 2.72% respectively. Fei Labs has proposed redeeming all aFEI for FEI which will remove [10,067,143.35](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaFBd7Bd91B4c1Dd289EE47a4F030FBeDfa7ABc12) units of FEI from the lending market. However, there are only ​​[9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units of FEI held within the lending market.\n\nFei Labs is unable to withdraw all of its FEI as there is insufficient liquidity, redeem amount [10,067,143.35](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaFBd7Bd91B4c1Dd289EE47a4F030FBeDfa7ABc12) > available liquidity​​ [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3). This is a problem for Fei Labs and also other lenders.\n\nThe market currently supports [11,308,536.17](https://etherscan.io/token/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units of aFEI, with 2,275,205.37 units of debt and [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units available for lenders to redeem their collateral from or for Users to borrow. Any User seeking to claim [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) or less is able to do so now, but this may change very quickly when Fei Labs or others starts redeeming aFEI causing liquidity to diminish.\n\nAave DAO has 619,185.82 units of aFEI at risk of being caught in an illiquid position. If the FEI held within the lending market falls below 619,185.82 units before Aave DAO redeems its position, it will become a trapped lender until such time as borrowers repay their loans. It is likely that as this market is unwound by large liquidity providers redeem aFEI, that the utilisation and interest rate will increase, which hopefully triggering borrowers to repay loans.\n\nThis proposal has been put in motion to try to prevent Aave DAO becoming a trapped lender in the FEI market by redeeming its aFEI before liquidity dries up. We encourage all Users of the market to take responsible action in light of recent events.\n\nOnce the aFEI has been redeemed for FEI, it is to be redeemed for DAI. Tribe DAO offers a DAI PSM with a 0.03% fee that facilitates redeeming FEI for DAI. This is a simple solution and one [supported by the Tribe DAO community](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475) as part of the transition to a terminal state. The DAI PSM module has around $14.5M of liquidity at the time of writing and can be tracked [here](https://dune.com/queries/1187683). In the event that redeeming FEI for DAI runs into any issues, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve. There is a bonding curve at peer review stage for swapping USDC for BAL which can be amended to facilitate offloading FEI into the spot market. We will provide updates in the comments as the situation unfolds.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe below provides a broad, high level summary of how the aFEI position held within the Reserve Factor will be managed.\n\n* All of the aFEI held with the Ethereum Economic Reserve is to be redeemed for FEI.\n* All FEI will be redeemed for DAI via the Tribe DAO DAI PSM\n  * If any issue arises, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve\n* DAI will be held in the Ethereum Reserve Factor\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 25th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to proceed as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.\n\nIf we can move quicker than the proposed dates above, please do let reach out.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC\n\nTEMP CHECKs serve as \"temperature checks\" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.\n\nConversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.\n\n### Proposal Template\n\nEach proposal **must** include the following sections:\n\nA header:\n1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.\n2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.\n3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nA proposal body:\n\n1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.\n2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.\n5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.\n6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.\n\n### Voting Guidelines\n\n1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.\n2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.\n3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.\n4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.\n5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.\n6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.\n\n### Proposal Cycle:\n\n![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nThis framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community.\n\nThis framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community's views.\n\n## Specification\n\nAs this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps \n\n1) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2) If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Summary:\nThis ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation if the following conditions are met:\n\nThe proposal is provided by a risk service provider or has received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\nThe proposed cap change is not greater than a 100% increase of the current cap or the implementation of a cap.\nThe cap is being decreased.\nThe AIP is implementing a FreezeReserve().\nFor other situations, the normal governance process is applicable.\n\nThis framework is intended for All V3 liquidity pools. Relative to freezing reserves, this framework is intended for all Aave pools.\n\n## Motivation:\nSupply and borrow caps are important safety features of Aave V3, and they are essential for maintaining the stability of the platform. However, these caps can also have a significant impact on the growth potential of the platform. If a cap ceiling is met and governance takes too much time to adapt, this can slow down the growth of the platform and limit its ability to meet the needs of its users.\n\nGiven the importance of supply and borrow caps, it is essential to have a governance process in place that can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions. A long-term viable solution would be a clear framework and the election via governance of a Risk Council having a degree of Risk management capability over the Aave protocol. However, while the definition and implementation of this is technically allowed by the Aave codebase, it is still immature.\n\nAs a temporary buffer, this ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation under certain conditions to increase the efficiency of the governance process. By streamlining the governance process in this way, we can ensure that the platform can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions and meet the needs of its users.\n\n## Specification:\nAs there’s no need for on-chain AIP or technical implementation for this ARFC, the outcome of a snapshot vote will be considered canon.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe author of this ARFC, Marc Zeller, is the founder of the Aave Chan Initiative and owns AAVE tokens. However, the ACI is not paid by the Aave Companies nor any other entity to submit this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\naip: <to be assigned>\ntitle: Add FEI to Aave V2\nstatus: Proposed\nauthor: Joey Santoro (@joeysantoro), Brianna Montgomery (@bpm6867)\nshortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the FEI stablecoin\ndiscussions: https://discord.gg/aDeErjS6Dt\ncreated: 2021-06-16\nupdated: N/A\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in lending markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: lending, synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n27K followers on Twitter, 2 17k members in Discord 3, Github\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\tDate of Deployment: March 28, 2021\n\tNumber of Transactions: 81,798\n\tNumber of Holders: 4,089\n\n## Rationale\nBecause FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing and lending. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0x08bbB5922550e6992ebDA8252A31AA02924EF28A\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0xa4893779e193AbD23CE494e5400ca340033606C7\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0xa4767eA500bc04430dE609A523CDc99c9537867C\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0x9f7663e34a2c2Be586126Eed5AF4651b062a51A6\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
