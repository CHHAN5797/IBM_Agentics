It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs\n\nKelp has more than 113,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 14,000 users. All of this is within 7 weeks of launching on Mainnet.\n\nBy providing liquidity for the restaked positions, rsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nKelp is seeking to establish the [rsETH/ETHx on Mainnet] and [WETH/rsETH on Polygon zkEVM] on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of rsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon\n\n2. **Oracles:** Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.\n\n3. **Audits:** Kelp's smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena. \nSigma Prime Report: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/SigmaPrime.pdf\nCode4rena: https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-11-kelp\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\nOur goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.\n\n5. **Market History:** Kelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 113k ETH and >14,000 holders of rsETH.\n \nThe balancer pools are already live and are available here: \n\n[Mainnet Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) \n[Polygon zkEVM Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/zkevm/pool/0xffc865fcb34e754fad4b0144139b9c28c81c3eff00000000000000000000005f)\n\nGauges: \n[Mainnet Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BcDb6d9b27Bd62d3De605393902C7d1a2c71Aab?)\n[Polygon zkEVM Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x047301b311741ce6C007FFEF7f182Ec93ab07968#readContract  )\n\n6. **Value:** The balancer pool is the first liquidity pool on Polygon zkEVM and is aimed at providing liquidity to the growing community.\n\n**Technical Specifications:**\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x0BcDb6d9b27Bd62d3De605393902C7d1a2c71Aab`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address):`0x047301b311741ce6C007FFEF7f182Ec93ab07968`\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon zkEVM`",

        "body": "PR with Payload:\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1456\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a wstETH-weETHs pool on Ethereum, with no emissions cap. This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\nReferences/Useful links:\n\n• Website - https://www.ether.fi/\n\n• Documentation - [ether.fi Whitepaper | ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper)\n\n• Github Page - [etherfi-protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol)\n\n• Discord - [ether.fi](https://discord.com/invite/zqGzcuQWvD)\n\n• Twitter - https://twitter.com/ether_fi\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is a decentralised, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols weETHs is a liquid restaking token, serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain and restaked on Symbiotic. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint weETHs, hold weETHs to accrue rewards, and use weETHs within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permissionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) liquidity pool into weETHs accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards and will also be natively restaked with Symbiotic. Staking with weETHs on[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) automatically restakes that ETH to Symbiotic and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their weETHs in other DeFi protocols. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, weETHs acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n[ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is looking to seed a wstETH-weETHs pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for weETHs on Ethereum. Incentivizing a Balancer pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Ethereum. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. Governance: - Currently, the protocol utilizes a DAO and a governance token model to push large initiatives and objectives.\n\n2. Oracles: - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the internal & external committee members.\n\n3. Audits: - Audit reports for the[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol are found on the GitBook page -[ Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n4. Centralization vectors: - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle which is run by a multi-party committee. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also tied into the functionality of the protocol oracle.\n5. Market History: - weETHs has been deployed and functional since June '24. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) Dune dashboard -[ https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi ](https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi)\n6. Value: - The wstETH-weETHs pool on Balancer is intended to serve as one of the primary liquidity sources for the token on Ethereum. The pairing of wstETH with weETHs will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.\n\nweETHs on Ethereum: 0x917cee801a67f933f2e6b33fc0cd1ed2d5909d88\n\nwstETH/weETHs Base pool on Balancer:[ Balancer 2 ](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x2ab8df7429f4fce60eb2c1233f0326767765e2f30000000000000000000006da)\n\n**Specification**\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x0Bb8B971AaF99eddfddE2e71736eBEBe8CC7769b`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1153\n\n**Summary:**\n\n>This proposal aims to approve the creation of a new gauge on Ethereum Mainnet with a 2% cap for APW-ETH\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website: https://spectra.finance/\n    • Documentation: https://docs.spectra.finance/ || https://dev.spectra.finance/\n    • Github Page: https://github.com/perspectivefi\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Spectra is an EVM-centric protocol for interest rate derivatives with an easy-to-use flagship app. The Spectra protocol is permissionless, meaning its services are entirely open for public use. Spectra’s Yield Token and Principal Token, minted on top of ERC-4626 interest-bearing tokens, are core protocol primitives. Spectra separates the right to principal from future yield via a process called yield tokenization. This process unlocks new financial possibilities beyond standalone interest-bearing tokens. Anyone can create new markets at will, swap yield derivatives, or become a liquidity provider. Spectra's native token, [APW](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spectra-2), powers it's flywheel tokenomics. Holders can lock APW into veAPW and use it to vote on LM, receive bribes and vote on governance proposals.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Spectra only has one primary source of liquidity and that is Balancer's APW <> ETH pool. We plan to deepen this relationship with tokenisation of Balancer Pool Tokens and veBAL liquid wrappers.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Spectra is a decentralized, community-governed protocol by the APW token holders. They can discuss, propose and vote on upgrades. Any APW holder can lock their tokens to convert into veAPW. More info on Spectra's governance can be found [here](https://app.spectra.finance/governance).\n\n2. **Oracles:** Spectra does rely on price oracles to determine price data\n\n3. **Audits:** [Audit Info](https://docs.spectra.finance/security/audits)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** None\n\n5. **Market History:** The APW/ETH pool was created approx. 7 days ago (29th of June, 2024). APW has been on the market since 18 May 2021, in that time it has not experienced sever volatility. Link to [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spectra-2), [Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x093254005743b7af89e24f645730ba2dd8441333) and [Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2fa29bbfd19314b3faf170dc7826ef69372203a6).\n \n6. **Value:** This is expected to be the primary pool for this token. APW liquidity mining started a couple weeks ago so users are expected to be either trading out of APW, locking it for governance or trading it into the liquid version of veAPW.\n\n**Technical Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x2fa29bbfd19314b3faf170dc7826ef69372203a6`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
