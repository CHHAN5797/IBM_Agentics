It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nSince the passing of BIP-55, the Balancer OpCo product development team has been a core team in the DAO since July 2022. This proposal aims to extend the product development services for the next quarter (Q2 2025), with significant changes to the team’s composition (see below). The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the Balancer DAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.\n\nAs in the previous proposals, the administrative and operational elements provided by Balancer OpCo to the Balancer ecosystem are submitted as a separate proposal.\n\n## Retrospective\n\nWhile Q4’24 was crowned by the launch of v3 to the world, OpCo started 2025 with sad news about Gareth and Anastas leaving the team in February, and Alberto giving notice of his departure in Q2. Beautiful things aren’t meant to last, and we are truly thankful for all the amazing work these guys have put into our ecosystem and our amazing frontend, but they wanted to pursue new challenges.\n\nThis proposal aims to downsize the team even further, relying on Beethoven’s expertise to lead the UI/UX efforts, and leaning more into Balancer Labs to assist with partner integrations. These changes are reflected in the current proposal with a much lower budget ask, and will be seen more effectively from Q3 and beyond.\n\nLooking back to the deliverables in the last funding round ([BIP-695](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-695-fund-opco-product-team-oct-mar/5993)), we consider objective #1 “Support the launch of the Balancer v3 protocol” and #4 “Frontend monorepo” fully completed, while objective #2 “New veBAL experience“ still needs some work and testing so we can fully ”Deprecate v2 UI & supporting infrastructure” in objective #3.\n\n## Length of Engagement & Budget\n\nBalancer OpCo is requesting $113,602for 3 months of funding, starting Apr 1, 2025 and ending June 30, 2025.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter.\n\n![opco2025_1.png](ipfs://bafybeihpl66nkgi3lxkwokgh5jryxqgfls3u4454dcitejiaohulqxjgj4)\n\n## Cost Basis Breakdown\n\nA further breakdown of the Balancer OpCo Product Team costs is shown below:\n\n![opco2025_2.png](ipfs://bafkreifxrxnhsvop6qjgcp6gzczsi5pzvc4t5fgpvomyxaoaxr7qrxipya)\n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting an allocation of 5,000 BAL for the period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. This ongoing BAL grant is being awarded to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff.\n\n## Objectives and Key Results (OKR) Approach\n\nThe Product Development team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI/UX available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows.\n\nQ2/25 will be focused on onboarding/transitioning the new team, mainly focusing on supporting new pool types in V3 and improving user experience based on community and bizdev feedback loop.\n\n**Objective #1: Supporting new pool types**\n\n* Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer: We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to provide liquidity, swap, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n* Implemente new features or improvements made to the Balancer smart contracts to the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n* Design, build, copywrite and maintain the marketing pages for the Balancer protocol. The primary aim of these pages will be to inspire and help onboard potential partners into the ecosystem.\n* Ensure this UI works across all modern devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n* Support the development and maintenance of the shared Beets/Balancer API. The Product Development team currently maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information.\n\n**Objective #2: Continuous improvement in user experience**\n\n* Optimize and improve this app so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer introduces in the future.\n* Work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit and integration tests.\n* Monitor relevant channels in Discord, Slack and Github issues for any reported problems and aim to respond within 24 hours and fix the problem as soon as possible.\n\n**Other OpCo operations**\n\n* Manage DNS for all Balancer DAO domains.\n* Manage 3rd party accounts, upgrades, renegotiations, etc. For example, RPC providers, AWS, and wallet check providers.\n* Github repositories:\nGitHub - balancer/frontend-v3: Official UI application for the Balancer protocol.\nGitHub - balancer/frontend-v2: Frontend app for the Balancer protocol (to be deprecated)\nGitHub - balancer/balancer-api: Deprecated (v2 API, to be deprecated)\nGitHub - balancer/tokenlists\nGitHub - balancer/metadata\n\nIn summary, Balancer OpCo’s product team is committed to building a market-leading DApp for the Balancer protocol and supporting growth opportunities through UI development as they arise. The product team are passionate about Balancer and committed to its long-term success.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, The Balancer Foundation will allocate the resources above to the Balancer OpCo Limited frontend team. No additional transfers from the DAO Treasury are needed, and funds will be allocated from previous savings.",

        "body": "**Service Provider Name:** Balancer OpCo (Product Team)\n\n**Core Contributor(s):** Gareth, Alberto, Anastas & Pon\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Introduction**\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nSince the passing of [BIP-55](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-55-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco/3609) and its subsequent extension ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)), Balancer OpCo has been an integral element of the DAO since July 2022. This proposal aims to extend the product development services for an additional 6 months (April 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024). As in the previous proposal, the administrative and operational elements provided by Balancer OpCo are submitted as a separate proposal.\n\nOur primary roles include Frontend Team Lead (Gareth), Frontend Core Engineers (Anastas and Alberto), and Product Designer (Pon). We also contract Ansaf, a long-time community member and experienced frontend developer, on a part-time basis.\n\nThe proposal period has been reduced from 9 months to 6 months to align with other service providers. Balancer OpCo is requesting $373,290 and 15,711.56 BAL for 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\n**Retrospective**\nBalancer OpCo product team was previously funded ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)) for 9 months from July 1, 2023, through to March 31, 2024.\n\nOur high-level goals stated in the previous proposal are as follows:\n\n* Increase LP engagement and satisfaction.\n* Increase veBAL adoption and holder engagement.\n* Increase awareness and adoption of the Balancer protocol.\n\nThese goals have not changed and will continue to guide our focus as we build out v3 of the Balancer canonical app.\n\nBefore shifting focus to v3, our primary focus was to track and improve the general user/LP experience in the v2 app. The KPI we used to do that was the Transaction Flow Error Free Rate, which is fatal errors in transaction flows divided by the total number of successful transactions submitted through the UI. When we started tracking this in July 2023 we were at ~84%. A concentrated effort was made to fix all fixable bugs in those flows and by February 2024 we were able to improve that rate to ~95%. It’s possible with further concentrated effort we could improve that KPI by 1-2%, however, some portion of the remaining 5% are bugs and issues that can be very challenging to resolve, such as wallet errors and specific user network/device issues.\n\nAlthough our focus was generally on improving UX and supporting growth opportunities in the v2 app, very early on in our previous funding period it became clear that we would need to shift focus to a new canonical web application that would support both Balancer v2 and v3 vaults. The reasons behind this are outlined in our [November monthly update](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/opco-product-team-november-2023-update/5417). In November 2023 we publicly put the v2 app into maintenance mode and shifted our focus to the v3 app.\n\nDespite most of our focus being directed towards the v3 application, we have done our best to support growth opportunities in v2 as they arose. An example of this is quickly supporting LRT pools and making them easily findable. We recognise that opportunities for the Balancer ecosystem, like LRTs, are extremely important for the growth of the protocol and we will always do what we can to support marketing and partnership operations through improvements in the UI.\n\nIn September 2023, Tim who was responsible for our backend infrastructure moved on to a new opportunity. Tim had built our v2 API that still serves the v2 frontend application. For v3, we will be using the shared Beets/Balancer API which is managed by Franz at Beets. So we are not looking to hire a replacement and therefore our people costs for this funding cycle are lower.\n\n**Key Objectives and Success Metrics**\nOur key objective for this funding proposal is to launch the v3 web application. The primary motivation for building a v3 app is to build support from the ground up for both v2 and v3 vaults and make the app multi-network native, that is, users will be able to explore and interact with pools across all networks and vaults within the same app. This would have been extremely difficult to do well within the context of the v2 app. This objective also includes a complete rebranding of the Balancer UI/UX.\n\nWe have already made significant progress towards this objective and aim to launch a beta UI by mid-April 2024. Following the beta launch, we will complete support for the v3 vault and launch the UI to the general public alongside the launch of the v3 protocol. The current target for the v3 launch is the end of Q2, 2024.\n\nOur secondary objective is to begin to deprecate the v2 application and its supporting infrastructure. The supporting infrastructure such as the v2 API contributes to our costs and the quicker we can deprecate it the quicker we can lower Balancer OpCo’s 3rd party software costs.\n\nThe success metrics for these objectives are clear, the protocol needs a UI that can support the v2 and v3 vaults, and the UI development should not delay the launch of the v3 protocol. However, our success metrics, besides launching the new app and v3 support, remain essentially the same as with v2. Our focus is on improving the experience and engagement for LPs and veBAL holders. We are already tracking some relevant KPIs (Transaction Flow Error Free Rate & NPS). We will continue to track and report these KPIs as we launch the v3 app.\n\nIn summary, Balancer OpCo’s product team is committed to building a market-leading DApp for the Balancer protocol and supporting growth opportunities through UI development as they arise. The product team are passionate about Balancer and committed to its long-term success.\n\n**Ongoing commitments**\nThe Product Development team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI/UX available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\n* Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\n  * We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to provide liquidity, swap, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n  * We will design, build and maintain the marketing pages for the Balancer protocol. The primary aim of these pages will be to inspire and help onboard potential partners into the ecosystem.\n  * We ensure this UI works across all modern devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n  * We will continually optimize and improve this app so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer introduces in the future.\n  * We will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit, integration and eventually E2E (End to End) tests.\n  * Whenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n  * This also includes responsibility for all copywriting across the app.\n* Ecosystem design support\n  * We will support broader ecosystem design initiatives. For example, we’ll collaborate with marketing on creative direction and occasional asset production.\n* Support the development and maintenance of the shared Beets/Balancer API\n  * The Product Development team currently maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information, as well as a SOR interface that services such as CowSwap use to calculate the best trade routes through Balancer pools.\n  * The existing API mentioned above will be deprecated in favour of the shared Beets/Balancer API at https://api-v3.balancer.fi.\n  * Additional functionality will be added to the shared Beets/Balancer API to support a simpler UI layer for v3.\n* User support\n  * We will monitor relevant channels in Discord, Slack and Github issues for any reported problems and aim to respond within 24 hours and fix the problem as soon as possible.\n* OpCo operations\n  * Manage DNS for all Balancer DAO domains.\n  * Manage user accounts/email addresses under those domains.\n  * Manage 3rd party accounts, upgrades, renegotiations, etc. For example, RPC providers, AWS, and wallet check providers.\n\nGithub repositories that we are directly responsible for:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v3\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v2 (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-api (v2 API, to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/tokenlists\n* https://github.com/balancer/marketing-site (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/metadata\n\nGithub repositories we are not directly responsible for but contribute to:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/docs\n* https://github.com/balancer/backend\n\n**Reporting**\nThe Product Development team is committed to transparency and openness in all our work. The majority of our day-to-day activities can be followed via the previously mentioned repositories. We are also committed to providing higher-level reporting on our work in the relevant calls and on the forum. Our reporting commitments will be as follows:\n\n* Weekly v3 roadmap call\n  * Audience: Internal, engineering and ecosystem leadership.\n  * Here we share status updates on our latest work and take note of any urgent requirements or future work for our team.\n* Monthly forum update\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A high-level written report of work done over the past 30 days, including how that work relates to our stated goals. We will also include reflections on challenges that may be standing in the way of progress on those goals.\n  * Relevant metrics that the Product Development team’s work has a direct impact on.\n* Quarterly community call update (if applicable)\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A higher-level update on the work done over the last quarter and work planned for the next quarter, including KPIs and visual content if relevant. This update will also include reflections on the team and its performance and any changes to the overall direction described in this funding proposal or previous quarterly reports.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget**\nBalancer OpCo product team is requesting 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\nWe request a total budget of $373,290 for the full period. Note that Balancer OpCo holds enough funds to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and other Service Providers vs their original budgets in years 1 and 2. For that reason, no new funding is required from the DAO for this proposal. The table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter.\n![bip-565-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibzvgelwxzehhvztwqftrggjbhvbum4k6rhjj6i5abtoryqhpgoom) \n\nNote that Non-People Costs are reduced in Q2 as we transfer some of those costs into the Balancer OpCo Admin & Ops [supplementary proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628). These costs are for 3rd party services that are used throughout the ecosystem and are critical to the ongoing operation of the DAOs infrastructure. We are referring to these as “Protocol Infrastructure”.\n\nA further breakdown of the Balancer OpCo Product Team costs is shown below:\n![bip-565-1.png](ipfs://bafkreigag7amrn6sougc46ncjc57gyaoioz3o4qgsbyhwsntolcqzsdjei)\n    \n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting an allocation of 15,711.56 BAL for the 6 month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. This BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 2 quarter proposal period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff.\n\n**Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo)**\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the Balancer DAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.",

It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nSince the passing of BIP-55 and its subsequent extension (BIP-351, BIP-565), the Balancer OpCo product development team has been a core team in the DAO since July 2022. This proposal aims to extend the product development services for an additional 6 months (October 1, 2024 - March 31, 2025). As in the previous proposal, the administrative and operational elements provided by Balancer OpCo are submitted as a separate proposal.\n\nOur primary roles include Frontend Team Lead (Gareth), Frontend Core Engineers (Anastas and Alberto), and Product Designer (Pon).\n\nBalancer OpCo is requesting $333,325 and 1,875 BAL for 6 months of funding.\n\nRetrospective\nBalancer OpCo product team was previously funded (BIP-565) for 6 months from April 1st, 2024 through September 30th, 2024.\n\nOur high-level goals stated in the previous proposal are as follows:\n\nIncrease LP engagement and satisfaction.\nIncrease veBAL adoption and holder engagement.\nIncrease awareness and adoption of the Balancer protocol.\nThese goals have not changed and will continue to guide our focus as we build out v3 of the Balancer canonical app.\n\nOur primary focus in the previous funding cycle was to build and launch the v3 app which we called Project Zen (or the Zen UI). The Zen UI was launched on the 18th of July (4 months into our funding cycle) and was generally considered a great success for the ecosystem.\n\nIn the build-out of the Zen UI we engaged the community through the Zentestooor initiative in Discord. A big shout-out is due to Tritium for the work he did to help us get this initiative off the ground and operational. Zentestooors found many bugs and suggested great improvements that were implemented before the launch. It undoubtedly contributed to the successful launch of the new app.\n\nThree weeks after launching the new UI we also launched support for CoW AMM, another resounding success for the ecosystem. The quick turnaround from launching the UI to adding support for an entirely different underlying AMM is a testament to the architectural decisions we have made building the new app. It puts us in a great position to support v3 and any other AMM variant opportunities that develop within the ecosystem.\n\nObjectives\nObjective 1: Support the launch of the Balancer v3 protocol\nTeam: Alberto, Pon, Gareth\n\nSummary:\nThe next big launch date for the Balancer ecosystem will be the v3 protocol launch. For this, the UI will need to seamlessly support v3 pools and promote them in an effective way. That is, the UI will need to support adding liquidity to v3 pools, which requires Permit2 approvals integration. It will also require work to ensure removing liquidity, staking and unstaking work seamlessly with v3 pools. Finally, we will ensure that v3 pools are findable, distinguishable from v2 pools and promoted effectively to support the ecosystem with the growth of the v3 protocol.\n\nKey results:\n\nThe UI accurately displays pool information for v3 pools.\nThe UI supports Permit2 approvals for adding liquidity to v3 pools.\nThe UI supports adding, removing, staking and unstaking of v3 liquidity.\nThe UI makes it easy to find and distinguish v3 pools.\nTimeline:\nThe launch of the v3 protocol is currently unknown so it is impossible for us to accurately say when the key results will be achieved. However, we have already started work on Permit2 support and our goal is to be ready to go live as soon as the protocol is ready.\n\nObjective 2: New veBAL experience\nTeam: Pon, Gareth, Anastas & Alberto\n\nSummary:\nveBAL features were deliberately left out of the launch of the new UI (we currently link back to the v2 UI if a user needs to manage their veBAL or vote on gauges etc). This is because veBAL is a huge feature, almost an app in itself. We also recognised that there is a lot we can do better with the veBAL experience to better promote ownership and engagement. So instead of delaying the launch of the new app, it made sense to leave implementation for post-launch.\n\nThe new veBAL experience is currently being designed and the majority of implementation will happen in this next funding cycle. The objective for this new experience is to more effectively promote and support the benefits of owning veBAL, including the acknowledgement and integration of incentive markets such as HiddenHand.\n\nEssentially, we want to take learnings from the existing veBAL experience in v2 and community tools for leveraging incentive markets and build a new and improved experience that maximises veBAL utility for holders.\n\nKey results:\n\nA veBAL management UI where users can lock, extend and unlock/withdraw their veBAL.\nA veBAL syncing UI where users can sync their veBAL balances to secondary networks.\nA veBAL voting UI where users can see all the available gauges that can be voted on, their current votes, their estimated weekly incentives for their votes, and a vote optimizer. The vote optimizer should use incentive market data to find the maximum return for a user’s voting power.\nTimeline:\nAs with all large scopes of work, it’s difficult to estimate precise delivery timelines. The design work for each key result is already underway. Some initial development work has been started for (1) and (2). At the time of writing, we estimate that a complete veBAL experience might be live by the end of the year or early next year.\n\nObjective 3: Deprecate v2 UI & supporting infrastructure\nTeam: Gareth\n\nSummary:\nNow that the new UI is live and supporting core pool actions, swapping and reward claiming, we must continue to migrate and shut down the remaining logic in the v2 UI. Deprecating the remainder of the v2 app will allow us to shut down the v2 API, which will reduce the ecosystem’s infrastructure costs.\n\nKey results:\n\nShut down the veBAL experience in v2 UI, possible when Objective 2 is complete.\nShut down claiming, portfolio and swap pages in the v2 UI.\nTurn off the v2 API.\nTimeline:\nThe target is to shut down the v2 API (and therefore the UI) by the end of the year.\n\nObjective 4: Frontend monorepo\nTeam: Gareth, Alberto & Anastas\n\nSummary:\nThe frontend team would like to start to restructure our work such that we can share and build tooling more easily with the wider community, within Balancer and DeFi more generally. In practice, this means converting our core repository to a monorepo and extracting useful logic into packages.\n\nKey results:\n\nA functional monorepo that contains the v3 frontend app.\nA package that exposes some useful functionality currently contained within the v3 app.\nTimeline:\nThis is a secondary objective so we will not set hard deadlines. Rather, we aim to do this at some point within the next funding cycle.\n\nOngoing commitments\nThe Product Development team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI/UX available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\nBuild, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\nWe aim to provide the best possible experience for users to provide liquidity, swap, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\nWe will design, build and maintain the marketing pages for the Balancer protocol. The primary aim of these pages will be to inspire and help onboard potential partners into the ecosystem.\nWe ensure this UI works across all modern devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\nWe will continually optimize and improve this app so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer introduces in the future.\nWe will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit and integration tests.\nWhenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\nThis also includes responsibility for all copywriting across the app.\nEcosystem design support\nWe will support broader ecosystem design initiatives. For example, we’ll collaborate with marketing on creative direction and occasional asset production.\nSupport the development and maintenance of the shared Beets/Balancer API\nThe Product Development team currently maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information.\nThe existing API mentioned above will be deprecated in favour of the shared Beets/Balancer API at https://api-v3.balancer.fi.\nUser support\nWe will monitor relevant channels in Discord, Slack and Github issues for any reported problems and aim to respond within 24 hours and fix the problem as soon as possible.\nOpCo operations\nManage DNS for all Balancer DAO domains.\nManage 3rd party accounts, upgrades, renegotiations, etc. For example, RPC providers, AWS, and wallet check providers.\nGithub repositories that we are directly responsible for:\n\nGitHub - balancer/frontend-v3: Official UI application for the Balancer protocol.\nGitHub - balancer/frontend-v2: Frontend app for the Balancer protocol (to be deprecated)\nGitHub - balancer/balancer-api: Deprecated (v2 API, to be deprecated)\nGitHub - balancer/tokenlists 1\nGitHub - balancer/metadata\nGithub repositories we are not directly responsible for but occasionally contribute to:\n\nGitHub - balancer/b-sdk\nGitHub - balancer/docs: Documentation for Balancer\nGitHub - balancer/backend\nIn summary, Balancer OpCo’s product team is committed to building a market-leading DApp for the Balancer protocol and supporting growth opportunities through UI development as they arise. The product team are passionate about Balancer and committed to its long-term success.\n\nReporting\nThe Product Development team is committed to transparency and openness in all our work. The majority of our day-to-day activities can be followed via the previously mentioned repositories. We are also committed to providing higher-level reporting on our work in the relevant calls and on the forum. Our reporting commitments will be as follows:\n\nWeekly v3 roadmap call\nAudience: Internal, engineering and ecosystem leadership.\nHere we share status updates on our latest work and take note of any urgent requirements or future work for our team.\nMonthly forum update\nAudience: Public\nA high-level written report of work done over the past 30 days, including how that work relates to our stated goals. We will also include reflections on challenges that may be standing in the way of progress on those goals.\nRelevant metrics that the Product Development team’s work has a direct impact on.\nQuarterly community call update (if applicable)\nAudience: Public\nA higher-level update on the work done over the last quarter and work planned for the next quarter, including KPIs and visual content if relevant. This update will also include reflections on the team and its performance and any changes to the overall direction described in this funding proposal or previous quarterly reports.\nLength of Engagement & Budget\nBalancer OpCo is requesting $333,325 for 6 months of funding, starting October 1, 2024 and ending March 31, 2025.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter.\n\n\n1032×545 41.3 KB\nA further breakdown of the Balancer OpCo Product Team costs is shown below:\n\n\n1227×478 46.7 KB\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting an allocation of 1,875 BAL for the 6 month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. This ongoing BAL grant is being awarded to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 2-quarter proposal period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff.\n\nLink to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the Balancer DAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.\n\nTechnical Specification\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer passing the Foundation/OpCo wallet 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 as recipient and amount 333,325 USDC as 333325000000.\n\nNo BAL transfers are required at this time.",

        "body": "Authoured by: Tristan, Mkflow#7938, Xeonus#4620, Gareth and Tim.\n\n## Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x05d36e7cb6f2f63ac84eb279ff7bb274eb6375a81429edc77655212c79d6d0ae) corporate structure supporting the BalancerDAO, and is intended to serve two primary functions:\n\n### Administrative & Operational\n\nServing as the operating entity with which third-party Service Providers to the BalancerDAO will contract, submit invoices to, and from which they will be paid whether that be in fiat or in tokens. This role is integral to the decentralized operations of the Balancer ecosystem, and in practice has to be in place for the healthy long term functioning of the DAO and the Balancer Protocol. The Balancer OpCo is also intended to host certain ecosystem-wide shared resources.\n\n### Front-End Dev and Engineering Workstream\n\nAs a continuation of the effort to thoughtfully decentralise the Balancer Ecosystem, we are proposing that the Balancer OpCo also house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO in the medium term. The Balancer OpCo will employ or contract the Front-End Development Team that will service the BalancerDAO. The Balancer OpCo will hold the software subscriptions for the necessary UI and marketing tools, and will host the Balancer.fi website.\n\nThe developers identified to fill these roles are drawn from top talent who have a proven track record performing development for the Balancer Ecosystem via Balancer Labs, and are transitioning over to the more decentralised structure of the DAO. They are passionate about the project and committed to its long-term success. The intention is to recruit additional talent to bolster the team, starting with 5 FTEs and moving to 6 FTEs in Q4 of 2022. There is one part-time contractor included in the headcount below. This is the staffing level determined necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the existing Balancer app, and to continue to expand the scope of the app to support the changes and improvements of the Balancer protocol.\n\nWe note for clarity’s sake that this is the proposal mentioned in the [Funding Proposal for the Balancer Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x05d36e7cb6f2f63ac84eb279ff7bb274eb6375a81429edc77655212c79d6d0ae).\n\n## Leader(s):\n\n### Administrative / Operations\n\nThe Balancer OpCo will operate under the direction of the Balancer Foundation, which will oversee / have responsibility for governance, corporate administration and operations. This includes managing software subscriptions and login credentials for the OpCo team and certain ecosystem-wide platforms and social media accounts.\n\n### Technical Lead for the Front-End Development Workstream\n\nBalancer OpCo's front-end development workstream is led by Gareth Fuller (@garethfuller) and by Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson).\n\nGareth joined Balancer in March of 2021 and quickly rose to lead the front-end team and the launch of Balancer's V2 app. He has over 10 years engineering experience and previously worked at Bitbond as a Senior Full-stack Engineer where he was involved in full-feature development for the P2P Bitcoin lending platform. In 2019 he played an integral engineering role in launching Bitbond's STO (Security Token Offering), one of the first in Europe. Gareth has been professionally involved in the crypto industry since early 2017.\n\nTim joined Balancer in September 2021. He has 15 years of development experience in many different languages, teams and locations. He's been involved in the decentralization space since 2017 initially focused on decentralized social media. Prior to that Tim was a senior developer at Cloud 9 IDE which was acquired by Amazon in 2016. At Amazon he worked on AWS Cloud9 and AWS Robomaker for 4 years before jumping full time into web3.\n\n## How the Front-end team will build the gateway to the Balancer Protocol:\n\nThe front-end team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol, as well as providing UI components and software tools for developers to easily build their own UI’s for Balancer related projects. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\n1. Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\n\n* The front-end team is responsible for the main Balancer website and application. We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to invest, trade, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n* We ensure this UI works across all devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n* We will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit and E2E (End to End) tests.\n* We will continually optimize and improve this front-end so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer gains in the future.\n* Whenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n\n2. Maintain API and caching services to retrieve Balancer information\n\n* The front-end team maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information, as well as providing a SOR interface that services such as CowSwap use to calculate the best trade routes through Balancer pools.\n* This API is hosted on AWS using serverless technology, however it will never be a central point of failure as the front-end can always fall back to using on-chain data. It is also completely open source and deployable via a CDK script so anyone can set up their own API service if they wish.\n\n3. Integrate the front-end with other app stores and services\n\n* As wallets and DeFi app-stores (such as Coinbase wallet, Sia Skynet, or the ethOS phone) become a more common way for users to interact with DeFi applications, we will work with providers to ensure Balancer is available in requested and approved locations.\n\n4. Provide tools that allow anyone to self-host the Balancer front-end\n\n* As Balancer is about maximizing decentralization and permissionless-ness, we seek to avoid the front-end being a centralized point of failure or control. As such we provide docker images and documentation for users to run the front-end locally using their own data providers. We will continually maintain these and make them easier to use over time.\n\n5. Provide documentation, resources and help to allow others to implement their own custom UI's for their project\n\n* Many projects integrate with Balancer smart contracts, such as Aave, Element Fi, CopperLaunch, Aura Finance, Olympus DAO, Gyro Protocol and more. Many more are constantly requesting integrations. We provide them with the UI elements and tools they need to be able to quickly create their own custom UI for their application, accelerating Balancer’s growth in the DeFi space.\n\n## How the Front-end team will measure success\n\nThe overarching goal is a world-class experience for Balancer users, which is seamless and always improving. The key metrics that measure this are:\n\n1. Minimal errors reported to Sentry\n2. 99%+ uptime of core features (pools information, investing, trades)\n3. All new Balancer features that require UI support will be available in the UI within 1 month of launch.\n4. At least one new version of the front-end will be released to production each week.\n\n## Front-end Team’s past achievements\n\nThe front-end team has seasoned web-3 qualifications. They built the Balancer Website and Application and all its current functionality from scratch and made it usable with all networks that Balancer has been deployed to. This included:\n\n* Building the Balancer Website, providing an overview of the service.\n* Building the core balancer app, providing the ability to invest, withdraw, trade tokens and claim rewards.\n* Deploying the balancer app on Arbitrum and Polygon chains.\n* Adding integration with Gnosis for gas-free, mev-resistant trades.\n* Building a pool creation UI so users can quickly and easily create their own custom pools of any tokens they like.\n* Building an API service that Cowswap can use for routing trades through balancer pools, and eventually being a caching service to speed up the front-end.\n* Adding the veBAL voting and staking system and all statistics and information related to that.\n* Supporting new core Balancer pool types as they are launched such as Boosted pools.\n* Adding graphs, APR’s and other information that give users a good indication of earning potential with Balancer.\n* Integrating with many new wallets and services such as Coinbase Wallet and Tally Wallet.\n* Providing a docker image and information for users to run their own front end + API service. Adding one-click deploy to Digital Ocean for this image.\n\n## Front-end Team’s future goals:\n\nWe aim to bring Balancer to as many relevant networks and places as possible, make it easier for developers to take UI components to build their own front-ends, and provide better statistics and analytics for our users.\n\n1. Separate the logic from the UI in the front-end, and move the logic to the Balancer SDK\n\n* We’re turning common queries into simple functions and classes in the SDK. This will allow other projects to more easily integrate with Balancer using these functions. Other projects can implement the logic they need using the SDK, and take visual components they need from the front-end.\n* This will allow the front-end team to iterate faster as we can focus purely on the UI and adding new functionality and speed optimizations while the SDK team handles the underlying logic.\n* The front-end team will also be contributing to the Balancer SDK providing improvements, fixes and new features as they are required for the UI.\n\n2. Improve the overall speed and experience of using the Balancer App\n\n* After much of the logic is moved to the SDK we plan to make the API use that same code to constantly load and cache the latest pool and token information, then provide an easy, fast API the front-end can use to load all the information it needs. This should decrease page loading speeds by more than 80%.\n* For maximum decentralization, the front-end will always have a fallback to using the graph + on-chain data in case this API is ever unavailable.\n* We plan to continually refine and optimize the app over time based on user feedback.\n\n3. Maintain and improve the Balancer app’s reliability and security\n\n* We plan to cover the app’s critical functionality with E2E tests.\n* We will continually add to and improve the app’s unit test coverage.\n* We will keep app dependencies as up to date as is reasonably possible.\n\n4. Make Balancer work seamlessly across all chains it supports\n\n* Currently the front-end is deployed to a separate domain for each network. We plan to consolidate all of this to app.balancer.fi and allow for network switching within this app.\n* Along with this rework we plan to make adding a new chain as easy as adding a new config file, so we can support many different Layer 2's and other chains quickly and easily.\n\n5. Provide better statistics and information to users\n\n* We've started improving Balancer APR's and Graphs to provide more information to our users on past investment performance and how much they can expect to earn. We plan to continually add more features and information to make Balancer a more useful investment dashboard.\n* We’re adding support for pools and tokens that generate yield or rebase in different ways, and ensuring all our statistics around them are correct.\n\n6. Support all the new features Balancer Ecosystem creates\n\n* There are some features in the pipeline such as single asset investing and withdrawing into boosted pools, managed pools etc. We will continually add new UI's to support these features and refine them based on user feedback over time.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n## Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nOne year - July 2022 (Q3 FY22) through June 2023 (Q2 FY23) divided into four quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. As per normal, each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be returned to the Balancer Treasury, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal.\n\nWe’re starting in July to account for the set-up and legal fees around the Balancer OpCo structure and compliance fees. It is envisaged that staff will transfer into the OpCo in Q4 2022.\n\n### Requests for USDC transfers:\n\nQ3 FY22 - USDC 62,219 - actual expenses incurred through the end of July 2022 and forecast for August & September June 2022 - immediate payment requested\n\nQ4 FY22 - USDC 418,691 - for transfer 25 September 2022\n\nQ1 FY23 - USDC 464,068 - for transfer 15 December 2022\n\nQ2 FY23 - USDC 533,217 - for transfer 25 March 2022\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nQ3 FY22 - BAL 116,678.08 - for transfer after the snapshot vote, if successful.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n![|624x335](upload://oMyEzVoRf3ueKQQr1VxWVuCQttX.png)\n\n### People Costs - Engineering\n\nPeople Costs are comprised of remuneration and employment costs for the developers. Remuneration is currently denominated in USD, AUD, GBP, and EUR. Exchange rate fluctuations against the US Dollar will impact the actual results. We have built a 5% buffer on FX rates and plan to hedge against this where practical by converting USD or USDC into reserves in those currencies.\n\nThe Front-end Development team is expected to be onboarded in Q4 with five full-time equivalent engineers, looking to hire one more by the end of Q4 and a possible additional team member in Q2 of 2023.

It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nThis proposal deals with the Product Development element housed in the OpCo. The initial discussion is at [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Product should be considered as a part of this proposal. This proposal has been adapted to incorporate feedback from that forum discussion and includes more details around the evolution from Front-end and Design to a more holistic Product model. In particular, a Product Vision section has been added and the Goals section has been updated to align our work more closely with protocol objectives. The proposal period has been reduced from 12 months to 9 months, and the budget has been tightened.\n\nFor reference, the Administrative and Operations element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923).\n\nThe revised proposal for Product seeks approval for 723,525 USDC, compared with 1,139,544 USDC for the previous version. The table below shows the bridge between the previous proposal budget and the revised proposal. Reducing the period to 9 months cut the forecast by 316k USDC down to 824k USDC. This also reduces the BAL request from 38,020.83 BAL to 28,958.33 BAL. We have further trimmed the proposal by 100k USDC to a final figure of 724k USDC.\n\n \n![bip351-1.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvwwaoop35udm3bqga4nnd6vir45n4kfwcymhnwe5t7bw3mxmri)\n    \n\nThe $100k reduction for the 9-month period comprises:\n\n* Dropping the FX buffer for non-USD payroll from 5% to 3%. Note that I have updated the FX rates from the mid buy/sell on xe.com to the rate used by the payroll provider in June, which moves against us slightly.\n* Cutting the allowance for unconfirmed increases in January of up to 5% down to 0%.\n* Cutting the payroll buffer for variances from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working, and hardware to zero.\n* Cutting the budget for TRM API calls of $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.\n\n# Product Development Workstream\n\nThis section has been removed from snapshot to adhere to the max. Character limit. Read about the full details on the forum.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nNine months - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through March 2024 (Q1 FY24) divided into three quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these three quarters. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be available to the DAO, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal.\n\nWe note that the Product team are employees/contractors under OpCo. Should DAO Governance vote to restructure the Product team, for example, change who maintains the front-end or for OpCo to cease hosting the front-end, OpCo policy is to provide staff severance equal to the requirements of local labour law in their jurisdiction, subject to a minimum of one month’s notice.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![bip351-2.png](ipfs://bafkreidscjaz2kkqlxc43hzv2orkewcycoswtzve5p7uxbje2ij5ndxrla)\n    \n\nA breakdown of the Product Dev People costs is here:\n\n \n![bip351-3.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvr76puowmubfmhlobuiegc5m5ponjpckhmmttdcdicqoch5ksi)\n    \n\n### Requests for USDC:\n\nThe OpCo holds funds saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3 FY23. We propose that USDC funding needs for Product be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the nine months of the Product proposal.\n\nQ3 FY23 - USDC 240,744 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ4 FY23 - USDC 241,975 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ1 FY24 - USDC 240,775 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nQ3 FY23 - 28,958.33 BAL - for transfer after the snapshot vote, if successful.\n\n### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe projected spend associated with this proposal can be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb from year 1, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.\n\nFor objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 12.3% of combined current unallocated funds at OpCo, and current DAO Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).\n\n### People Costs - Product\n\nPeople Costs are comprised of remuneration and employment costs for the developers. Remuneration is currently denominated in USD, AUD, GBP, and EUR. Exchange rate fluctuations against the US Dollar will impact the actual results. We have built a 3% buffer on FX rates.\n\nThere is also a buffer to cover small unexpected variances in employment costs. As mentioned, this has been cut from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working and hardware to zero. Any unused amounts will either be rolled into the next funding proposal or returned to the DAO.\n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting 28,958.33 BAL for the nine-month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. These BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 4-year vesting period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff, or return to the DAO Treasury.\n\n### Non-People Costs - Product\n\nNon-People Costs Product consists of software subscriptions to front-end development tools and TRM. These costs have reduced significantly from year one. New additions to the cost structure relate to the design element, proposed to be housed in OpCo from 1 August 2023.\n\nAlchemy is the largest line item at $2,945 per month or $35,340 for the period. The TRM annual subscription runs until May 2024. The annual renewal (est $30k) is outside the period of this proposal and is therefore excluded. In addition, the team is cutting the budget for TRM API calls from $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.\n\nThese and the other software costs depend on certain variables, including, for example, the number of users, log-ins, number of entities in the community that have access, and service calls. Some are billed monthly and others quarterly or annually, hence the changes in costs from one quarter to the next. We have estimated these figures using the best information available as of now, and recognise there will likely be variances during the year as more accurate data becomes available and actual costs become known. The team continues to monitor the usage of these services in order to reduce fees, and where possible negotiate more favourable rates - noting that material negotiations were undertaken in year one that we continue to reap the benefits of.\n\n# ETH Address to Receive BAL:\n\n0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693, a multisig controlled by the Balancer OpCo.\n\n# Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the BalancerDAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.",
