This ARFC proposal suggests that Aave supports Lido Alliance efforts by deploying a new Aave V3 ETH market for Lido. This Aave v3 instance will be designed and tuned to support stETH leverage loopers. The deployment will only include wstETH and wETH assets with E-Mode enabled.\n\nLido has committed incentive programs and ecosystem support for this instance in order to bootstrap liquidity and promote additional programs within the Lido Alliance.\n\nThis market will be bootstrapped with wETH from the Ahab program to attract wETH liquidity.\n\nwETH suppliers will also be proposed to be eligible to a dedicated Merit Boost\n\nIncentives from Lido will be detailed ahead of the AIP deployment. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe Lido Alliance’s Aave v3 instance implements the following:\n\n- The borrow cap of wETH will be set to 90% of supplied wETH, with updates tightly controlled by the risk steward. This will ensure that stETH/wETH loops are consistently profitable and can't go into negative territory.\n- E-Mode LTV & LT are set 50 bps above all other Aave implementations, making it the most efficient loop venue in the industry.\n- For the first 6 months of the Lido Alliance Aave v3, wETH slope1 will be set at 2.50%, ((currently 2.7% on mainnet and on L2s) and wETH RF set at 10% (currently 15% on all markets). This will make it the most profitable venue to loop stETH & wETH.\n- wstETH RF will be 5%.\n\nThe deployment of the Aave V3 Lido Ecosystem Aave will be done by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.\n\n|Parameter|wstETH value|wETH value|\n|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|650K|900K|\n|Borrow Cap|12k|810K|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|NA|\n|LTV|80.00%|82.00%|\n|LT|81.00%|83.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|6%|5%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|3.5%|2.50%|\n|Variable Slope2|85%|85%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|5.00%|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|\n|Flahloanable|Yes|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|No|\n|E-Mode|Yes|Yes|\n|E-Mode LTV|93.5%|93.5%|\n|E-Mode LT|95.5%|95.5%|\n|E-mode Liquidation Bonus|1%|1 %|\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nLido Alliance proposal: https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-alliance-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem/7475\n\n https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/17930\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lido and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.

This will enable the ACI to enact incentive programs funded by SNX ecosystem partners for all sUSD markets, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave on Optimism.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been in discussion with various parties that have a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of Aave V3 on Optimism. In order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for sUSD on Optimism. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. \n\nBy setting the multisig as the emission manager for the sUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the protocol and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets on Optimism.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe ACI multisig address OP:0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd will be set as Emissions manager.\n\nThe call to the setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract will be as follows:\n\n`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(sUSD, 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd);`\n\nThis method will set the ACI multisig as the emission admin for the sUSD token on Optimism Aave V3 market.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is working with Synthetix to define the emissions program for sUSD. ACI has not been paid by any third party for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

As a result, onboarding PYUSD into Aave has:\n\n- Built synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n- Offered Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n- Strengthened the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin.\n\nIn order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for PYUSD on Aave V3 Ethereum Market. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. By setting the multisig as the emission manager for the PYUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets on the Ethereum Chain.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) multisig address eth :0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd\n\nwill be set as Emissions manager.\n\nThe call to the setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract will be as follows:\n\n`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(pyUSD,0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd);`\n\nThis method will set the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emission admin for the PYUSD token on Aave V3 Ethereum Market.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is working with various partners to define the emissions program for PYUSD on Aave V3 Ethereum Market. ACI has not been paid by any third party for this proposal and will not be compensated for this work. \n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This will enable ACI to manage incentive programs funded by different partners, with the purpose of stimulating market activity and growth.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nLiquidity mining programs are essential for attracting liquidity providers by offering rewards for their participation. Effective management of these programs is crucial for the sustained growth of the Aave Ecosystem. Therefore, ACI, with its extensive experience and strategic partnerships, is well-positioned to manage these emissions effectively.\n\nA recent example is the [Long Term Incentive Program (LTIPP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741) from Arbitrum DAO, where Aave DAO will receive 750,000 ARB tokens, illustrating the benefits of coordinated emission management.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n1. Appointment of ACI as Emission Manager for Liquidity Mining Programs\n    1. ACI will be authorized to manage Emission Programs for Liquidity Mining across Aave Markets.\n    2. ACI’s multisig address will be the one receiving and distributing emissions on behalf of the DAO.\n2. Appointment of ACI as coordinator with ecosystem partners, to define and implement emission strategies, managing the distribution of rewards to liquidity providers, and monitor & adjust emissions based on market performance.\n3. Integration of Liquidity mining program as part of “Dolce Vita” service of the ACI at no extra cost for the DAO.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe ACI multisig address will be set as the emission manager via the **`setEmissionAdmin()`** method in the relevant emission manager contracts.\n\nACI multisig address: 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd\n\nThis method will appoint the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emissions admin for all potential Liquidity Mining Programs.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-26\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\nThis proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nArtemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 30.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Website](https://artemisfinance.io)\n\n[X](https://x.com/Artemisfinance)\n\nDocuments:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/)\n\nAudit Report:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit)\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
