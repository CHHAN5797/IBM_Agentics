        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1105\n\n**Summary:**\n> This proposal aims to approve the creation of two new gauges on main net with a 2% cap for new 80/20 pools, BAO/baoETH-ETH and BAO/baoUSD-LUSD.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website: https://www.baofinance.io/\n    • Documentation: https://info.bao.finance/docs\n    • Github Page: https://github.com/baofinance\n    • Communities: [Bao Finance](https://discord.com/invite/BW3P62vJXT), https://twitter.com/BaoCommunity\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Bao Finance is a community-run project creating onchain tokenized derivatives (synths) and infrastrcture. Our current synths, baoUSD and baoETH, are backed by ETH based debt positions via our vaults.\n>\n>\n>\n> BaoETH is minted by whitelisted contracts, which currently are “the fed” and “ammFED” (AMO). The Bao multisig has control over which contracts are whitelisted. Changes are approved via governance.\n>\n>\n>\n> The fed mints synths into our borrow vaults, ready to be borrowed against highly liquid & decentralized ETH based collaterals such as wstETH and rETH. Controlling the available supply also affects the variable loan interest rate, helping maintain the peg.\n>\n>\n>\n> The ammFED mints synths directly into balancer liquidity pools containing a backing asset, helping to maintain the peg and profiting from peg deviations.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> We have made Balancer our primary source of liquidity for our synths and would like to improve liquidity for our governance token by switching to and incentivising new 80/20 pools, which we also plan to switch incentives to on our own platform pending a governance vote.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:**Bao is governed by the Bao community. Actions voted on are carried out by the community “council of guardians” via its 3/7 multi-sig. This multisig/ council of guardians controls various synth parameters like the mint limit and collaterals.  We plan on using governor bravo or similar in the future to improve decentralization.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Chainlink oracles are used to find collateral prices.\n\n3. **Audits:** Bao re-uses battle-tested compound, inverse and curve with some changes & has had bug bounties open on immunefi covering all of our live contracts. \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** The 3/7 multisig controls various parameters such as collateral factors, IMF factor (CF factor reduces as loan size increases), liquidation incentive, ability to deposit collateral, price oracle, new collateral additions, mint limits and the ammFED.\n\n5. **Market History:** All Bao’s synths have remained closely pegged to their target prices since inception and have robust mechanisms to help stay pegged. The one historically exception to this was a temporary depeg of baoUSD during USDC’s depeg. Since then all synths no longer accept USDC as collateral, relying on decentralized, highly liquid ETH backed tokens like wstETH, rETH and LUSD instead. The BAO token has not seen any extreme volatility and has been relatively stable since tokenomics were changed several months ago to remove inflation.\n \n6. **Value:** These pools are intended to be the primary liquidity for the BAO governance token. Balancer will benefit through trading fees and increased voting incentives for BAL and AURA holders. Bao has a track record of providing vote incentives and building governance power within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nPools: \n\n- **[20B-baoUSD-LUSD-BPT-80BAO](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x9412206f58cc72b9b4e340422a95354372a3ec3d00020000000000000000069a)**: 0x9412206f58cc72b9b4e340422a95354372a3ec3d\n- **[20B-baoETH-ETH-BPT-80BAO](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x19df5bb37380186bc8efc5ad91516373a2c5459f000200000000000000000698):** 0x19DF5BB37380186bC8EFc5Ad91516373A2C5459f\n\nGauge 2% cap: \n\n- **20B-baoUSD-LUSD-BPT-80BAO-gauge:** 0x6b9dE817875952Cb23d985AbF6fa9ec4b7f66ad5\n- **20B-baoETH-ETH-BPT-80BAO-gauge:** 0x7C02ac2BAd481dC4E566D3D54359244f381d58dC\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n> The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n>\n>gauge(address): `0x6b9dE817875952Cb23d985AbF6fa9ec4b7f66ad5 `\n> gaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n>\n>gauge(address): `0x7C02ac2BAd481dC4E566D3D54359244f381d58dC`\n> gaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Our synths, baoUSD and baoETH, are backed by debt positions created in our vaults, and stable assets via its PSM.\n>\n>\n>\n> BaoETH is minted by whitelisted contracts, which currently are “the fed” and “the ballast”. The Bao multisig has control over which contracts are whitelisted. Changes are approved via governance.\n>\n>\n>\n> The fed mints baoETH into our vaults, ready to be borrowed against highly liquid collaterals. Controlling the borrowable supply also affects the variable loan interest rate, helping maintain the peg.\n>\n>\n>\n> The baoETH ballast mints baoETH when supplied with ETH at a 1:1 ratio. While there is ETH available, baoETH can be burned to claim ETH at a 1:1 ratio. The baoETH“mint limit” is controlled by the BAO multisig.\n>\n>\n>\n> Bao also issues basket tokens, representing an index of underlying tokens with the option to a yield strategy. These underlying assets are not tradeable with each other, so don’t suffer from the same risk vectors as an LP position, where a single asset could destroy the value of the entire position, or pool balances can be manipulated into an exploitable state. Each basket token represents the holders’ share of underlying assets. It can be minted with a supply asset (ETH, DAI), which is traded for the underlying assets and deposited into their yield strategy. Underlying assets can be redeemed at any time by basket token holders. The composition of each basket is managed via governance. Our current baskets are bSTBL (yield bearing USD basket) and bETH (a basket of LSD tokens)\n>\n>\n>\n> bSTBL and bETH are designed to be ideal collateral for baoETH, focusing on the industry’s lowest risk, most liquid stable-coins and LSDs, and the safest yield strategies. Using bSTBL and bETH as collateral for baoETH allows highly liquid, stable, and yield-bearing collateral whose underlying assets and strategies can be adapted over time with the market, without relying on users to alter their positions. The current composition of bSTBL is 50% DAI and 50% USDC and the composition of bETH is initially 71% wstETH and 29% rETH.\n>\n>\n>\n> Further baskets and synthetics are planned in the future.\n>\n>\n>\n> Currently there is no incentivised liquidity for baoETH although this is expected to change shortly as there is a routine governance proposal on the Bao governance forum activating rewards for several gauges based around the beoETH balancer base pool - baoETH/ETH, BAO/baoETH-ETH and bETH/baoETH-ETH. https://gov.bao.finance/t/bip-36-base-pool-gauges/1229\n\nAdditional details on our expansion and decentralization plans can be found here, in our successful baoUSD gauge proposal: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-270-enable-baousd-lusd-gauge-w-2-cap-ethereum/4673/6?u=chickn\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> We would like Balancer to become an essential marketplace for our synthetics. Integrations outside our liquidity gauges are key to sustainability. Balancer was chosen to create Bao’s USD base pool, baoUSD/LUSD, because it is easy to pair with any other token whether stable or volatile. We would like to continue this relationship with our baoETH base pool. Bao intends to use the flexibility of balancers pools to increase adoption of baoETH by allowing other projects to pair tokens with our base pools and incentivise liquidity with Bao emissions on the Bao Finance platform. If successful, the balancer community will benefit from their growing adoption through trading fees and boosts to liquidity in addition to bribes to vote for the pool. \n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. Governance: Currently baoETH is governed by the BAO community. Actions voted on are carried out by the community “council of guardians” via its 4/7 multi-sig. This multisig/ council of guardians controls various baoETH parameters like it’s mint limit and collaterals. The council of guardians includes at least one member of each permanent Galaxy (sub team), and any guardian can be recalled at any time via public vote. We plan on using governor bravo or similar in the future to improve decentralization.\n\n> 2. Oracles: Chainlink oracles are used to find collateral prices.\n\n> 3. Audits: Bao re-uses battle-tested compound, inverse, and curve code with some changes and is in the process of auditing\n\n> 4. Centralization vectors: The 4/7 multisig controls the supply of baoUSD available in the PSM and lending market. Other parameters under the multisig control are collateral factors, IMF factor (CF factor reduces as loan size increases), liquidation incentive, ability to deposit collateral, price oracle, new collateral additions.\n\n> 5. Market History: baoETH has been closely pegged since its inception and has robust, battle-tested mechanisms to help it stay pegged. It did suffer a similar depeg to USDC recently, primarily due to most of the available liquidity being in pools containing USDC and DAI. Steps are being taken to reduce reliance on USDC.\n\n> 6. Value: baoETH is in its infancy, but balancer has an opportunity to become the primary source of liquidity for it and future synthetics. The Bao protocol gained a lot of exposure during 2021, attracting up to $200m in liquidity with only a vision, and now the community lead project is launching its first products.\n\nPool: [0x1A44E35d5451E0b78621A1B3e7a53DFaA306B1D0](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x1a44e35d5451e0b78621a1b3e7a53dfaa306b1d000000000000000000000051b)\nGauge 2% cap: [0xD449Efa0A587f2cb6BE3AE577Bc167a774525810](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD449Efa0A587f2cb6BE3AE577Bc167a774525810#code)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xD449Efa0A587f2cb6BE3AE577Bc167a774525810` which corresponds to the 2% capped gauge for this pool\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Our first synth, baoUSD, is backed by debt positions created in our vaults, and stable assets via its PSM.\n>\n> BaoUSD is minted by whitelisted contracts, which currently are “the fed” and “the ballast”. The Bao multisig has control over which contracts are whitelisted. Changes are approved via governance.\n>\n> The fed mints baoUSD into our vaults, ready to be borrowed against highly liquid collaterals. Controlling the borrowable supply also affects the variable loan interest rate, helping maintain the peg.\n>\n> The baoUSD ballast mints baoUSD when supplied with DAI at a 1:1 ratio. While there is DAI available, baoUSD can be burned to claim DAI at a 1:1 ratio. The baoUSD “mint limit” is controlled by the BAO multisig.\n>\n> Bao also issues basket tokens, representing an index of underlying tokens with the option to a yield strategy. These underlying assets are not tradeable with each other, so don’t suffer from the same risk vectors as an LP position, where a single asset could destroy the value of the entire position, or pool balances can be manipulated into an exploitable state. Each basket token represents the holders’ share of underlying assets. It can be minted with a supply asset (ETH, DAI), which is traded for the underlying assets and deposited into their yield strategy. Underlying assets can be redeemed at any time by basket token holders. The composition of each basket is managed via governance.\n>\n>bSTBL is Bao's first basket and is designed to be ideal collateral for baoUSD, focusing on the industry’s lowest risk, most liquid stable-coins, and the safest yield strategies. Using bSTBL as collateral for baoUSD allows highly liquid, stable, and yield-bearing collateral whose underlying assets and strategies can be adapted over time with the market, without relying on users to alter their positions. The current composition of bSTBL is 50% DAI and 50% USDC.\n>\n>Further baskets and synthetics are planned in the future, beginning with the upcoming bETH and baoETH, which will work similarly to bSTBL and baoUSD.\n>\n>Currently the only exchange with baoUSD liquidity is curve. The baoUSD/3crv pool can be found here: https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-84/swap 5\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> We would like Balancer to become an essential marketplace for our synthetics. Integrations outside our liquidity gauges are key to sustainability. Balancer was chosen to create Bao’s USD base pool, baoUSD/LUSD, because it is easy to pair with any other token whether stable or volatile. Bao intends to use this property to increase adoption of baoUSD by allowing other projects to pair with this pool and incentivise it with Bao emissions on the Bao Finance platform. If successful, the balancer community will benefit from their growing adoption through trading fees and boosts to liquidity in addition to bribes to vote for the pool.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n> 1. Governance: Currently baoUSD is governed by the BAO community. Actions voted on are carried out by the community “council of guardians” via its 4/7 multi-sig. This multisig/ council of guardians controls various baoUSD parameters like it's mint limit and collaterals. The council of guardians includes at least one member of each permanent Galaxy (sub team), and any guardian can be recalled at any time via public vote. We plan on using governor bravo or similar in the future to improve decentralization.\n\n> 2. Oracles: Chainlink oracles are used to find collateral prices.\n\n> 3. Audits: Bao re-uses battle-tested compound, inverse, and curve code with some changes and is in the process of auditing\n\n> 4. Centralization vectors: The 4/7 multisig controls the supply of baoUSD available in the PSM and lending market. Other parameters under the multisig control are collateral factors, IMF factor (CF factor reduces as loan size increases), liquidation incentive, ability to deposit collateral, price oracle, new collateral additions.\n\n> 5. Market History: baoUSD has been closely pegged since its inception and has robust, battle-tested mechanisms to help it stay pegged. It did suffer a similar depeg to USDC recently, primarily due to most of the available liquidity being in pools containing USDC and DAI. Steps are being taken to reduce reliance on USDC.\n\n> 6. Value: baoUSD is in its infancy, but balancer has an opportunity to become the primary source of liquidity for it and future synthetics. The Bao protocol gained a lot of exposure during 2021, attracting up to $200m in liquidity with only a vision, and now the community lead project is launching its first products. \n\nContract Addresses\n\n> * **baoUSD-LUSD StablePool:** https://etherscan.io/address/0x7e9afd25f5ec0eb24d7d4b089ae7ecb9651c8b1f\n> * **baoUSD-LUSD StablePool Gauge:** https://etherscan.io/address/0x5af3b93fb82ab8691b82a09cbbae7b8d3eb5ac11#readContract\n\nSpecification:\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call performAction with the GaugeController at `0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD` for the target(address) argument and using 0x3a04f900 followed by the gauge address `0x5aF3B93Fb82ab8691b82a09CBBae7b8D3eB5Ac11` and the corresponding gauge type for the data(bytes) argument.\n\ndata(bytes) :\n`0x3a04f9000000000000000000000000005af3b93fb82ab8691b82a09cbbae7b8d3eb5ac110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`",

Preon's core product is STAR, an overcollateralized USD stablecoin.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for STAR/USDC.e 50/50 Composable Stable Pool. Platform incentives would help deepen STAR liquidity as we seek to diversify liquidity positions. We aim to incentivize pools, especially our veBAL gauge in coordination with Hidden Hand & Aura to facilitate incentivization and drive the Balancer bribe market forward\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Currently the governance is held by a multisig. Holders can be found here: https://docs.preon.finance/information/multisig\n\n2. **Oracles:** The protocol relies on Chainlink.\n\n3. **Audits:** https://docs.preon.finance/information/security \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some parts of the protocol are secured by an 4/8 multisig of public members. \n\n5. **Market History:** $STAR is a new stablecoin. Been trending around $1.00 since inception.\n \n6. **Value:** This is one of the few STAR pools deployed on Arbitrum resulting in high TVL on Balancer. We expect it to generate a significant amount of volume which will be beneficial for all LPs and users of Preon and the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nLink to the pool: \nhttps://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xead7e0163e3b33bf0065c9325fc8fb9b18cc82130000000000000000000004a9\nLink to gauge 10% cap: [0x329cAebB9be5144C5727347F64F8B3a3B109ec57](https://etherscan.io/address/0x329cAebB9be5144C5727347F64F8B3a3B109ec57)\n\n**Specifcations:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x329cAebB9be5144C5727347F64F8B3a3B109ec57`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
