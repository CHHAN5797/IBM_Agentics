During these times, there can also be cascading, systemic effects from a lack of liquidations. For each loan that is liquidated, liquidators purchasing the collateral and selling it causes the price to further decrease causing further liquidations. On the other hand, if the bonus is too high, suppliers are losing out on profits to liquidators. Continual monitoring and adjustment of this parameter is crucial for optimizing the security vs. capital efficiency trade-off in Aave.\n\n## Motivation \n\nLarge liquidation bonuses increase the regime in which the incentives are counterproductive. [See section 6.3](https://gauntlet.network/reports/aave). Lower liquidation bonuses for a single week in May would have mitigated $4M in [depositor losses](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters/4854#mitigating-depositor-losses-4m-usd-13-of-total-liquidation-value-between-may-17-23-2021-7) while maintaining a low risk of insolvency.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bUXZCnB.png)\n\nUser experience is another factor worth considering. Depositor losses occurred for 590 distinct users during the week of May 17-23. Mitigating losses without increasing the net insolvent value percentage or the slashing run percentage is possible. \n\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset  | Current Liquidation Bonus | Recommended Liquidation Bonus Update |\n| ------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| ZRX    | 10%                       | 8%                                   |\n| WBTC   | 10%                       | 9%                                   |\n| SNX    | 10%                       | 9%                                   |\n| YFI    | 15%                       | 12.5%                                |\n| CRV    | 15%                       | 12.5%                                |\n| AAVE   | 10%                       | 8%                                   |\n| REN    | 10%                       | 9%                                   |\n| MANA   | 10%                       | 8%                                   |\n| BAT    | 10%                       | 9%                                   |\n| XSUSHI | 15%                       | 12.5%                                |\n\n\n## Model Inputs\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1T1fPHe.png)",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust three (3) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across two (2) Aave V2 assets. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n## Specification\n\n\nThe past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility. However, there were also decreases in liquidity and trading volume. Our simulations show that increasing borrow parameters across a wide array of assets could introduce significantly more risk in the short term. The below recommendations drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining risk at safe levels.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |\n| FEI Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 02/10 to 02/24. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 02-24 Volatility| 02-10 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| DPI    | 0.767483446      | 0.952875317     | -0.185391871      | 4.8907976   |\n| FEI    | 0.05450812       | 0.072266895     | -0.017758775      | -41.5184138 |\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0UZoeQX.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-03-01\n",

        "body": "[Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-10-7/5854)\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust thirteen (13) total risk parameters across eleven (11) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus.\n\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of three risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations, the latest being [AIP-39: Risk Parameter Updates for Aave V2 assets](https://app.aave.com/governance/39-QmXQMnHQMP6KmwkCG8MjBCjxxNEeaHszh9FgFZFASkqPS2).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Volatility for non-stablecoin crypto assets remains high. As such, we focused on supporting protocol safety for our parameter changes in this cycle. \n\nAdjustments were also made for three liquidation bonus values. These assets (UNI, BAL, LINK) saw increases in liquidity and trading volume and a reduced liquidation recommended value as a result. As always, simulation recommended values seek to maintain capital efficiency and uphold borrow usage levels.  \n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 50%     |\n| SNX Loan To Value     | 20%     | 30%     |\n| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 45.0%     | 55.0%     |\n| DPI Loan To Value     | 60%     | 55%     |\n| UNI Loan To Value     | 60%     | 55%     |\n| UNI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.0%     |\n| YFI Loan To Value     | 45%     | 50%     |\n| BAL Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.0%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| BAT Liquidation Threshold    | 75.0%     | 80.0%     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Threshold    | 60.0%     | 65.0%     |\n| MANA Liquidation Threshold    | 65.0%     | 75.0%     |\n| ZRX Liquidation Threshold    | 70.0%     | 75.0%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 9/28 to 10/06 that were important drivers for the updated parameter recommendations.\n\nIt is important to note that these drivers give insight into why Gauntlet's simulations will output a new VaR calculation for a set of parameters, but each parameter can not be estimated by input changes. For example, the decrease in trading volume for DPI indicates lowered liquidity, while there are large increases for ENJ, MANA, and BAT. These suggest more liquidity and easier liquidations, but that relationship changes over time. \n\n|Symbol| 10-06 Volatility| 09-28 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n|BAL   |1.571708299    |1.639825348    |-0.068117049     |-10.9455427|\n|BAT   |1.26231086     |1.275188876    |-0.012878016     |15.9070933 |\n|DPI   |1.248509981    |1.229162786    |0.019347195      |-32.3316308|\n|ENJ   |1.684204979    |1.660170507    |0.024034472      |41.6823744 |\n|LINK  |1.516493567    |1.544861958    |-0.028368391     |-26.3753689|\n|MANA  |1.496152162    |1.514235863    |-0.018083701     |17.6977064 |\n|REN   |2.073377777    |2.076540272    |-0.003162495     |-30.6057152|\n|SNX   |1.817169075    |1.805791921    |0.011377154      |-8.6204277|\n|UNI   |1.625790476    |1.592116599    |0.033673877      |-10.4719062|\n|YFI   |1.240436029    |1.248934665    |-0.008498636     |-4.4142493|\n|ZRX   |1.496783606    |1.474725052    |0.022058554      |-14.7444996|\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UOjd3vU.png)\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2021-10-11",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust six (6) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. In addition, Gauntlet recommends freezing legacy KNC. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/y5LyFij.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/95FlRiM.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H7tmsj4.png)\n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n\n**Top DAI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Yy1vh2V.png)\n\n**Top USDC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4AMTHAl.png)\n\n**Top LINK non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/14UkwWx.png)\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nOur recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. \n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| DAI Loan To Value     | 75%     | 77%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 6.5%     | 6.3%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Threshold    | 75%     | 78%     |\n| USDC Loan To Value    | 82.5%     | 85.5%     |\n| USDC Liquidation Bonus    | 4.0%     | 4.5%     |\n| USDC Liquidation Threshold    | 85%     | 86%     |\n\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 03/17 to 03/31.

As of 3/28/2022, roughly 195M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdefa4e8a7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 57M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdd974d5c2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There are currently $2.9M KNCL supplied and $900K total borrowed on Aave v2.\n\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-04-05\n\n",
