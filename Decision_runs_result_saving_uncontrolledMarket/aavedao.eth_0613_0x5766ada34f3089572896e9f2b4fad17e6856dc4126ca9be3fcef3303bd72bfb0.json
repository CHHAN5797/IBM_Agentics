        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to whitelist deBridge, a generic messaging and cross-chain interoperability protocol, for Portals V3 on all chains where Aave v3 is deployed – with credit lines for USDC ($4M per chain), USDT ($4M per chain), and ETH (2000 ETH per chain).\n\n## Overview\n\n**[deBridge](https://debridge.finance/)** is a generic messaging and cross-chain interoperability protocol that enables decentralized transfers of arbitrary data and assets between blockchains. The protocol is an infrastructure platform and framework for:\n- Cross-chain composability of smart contracts\n- Cross-chain swaps (deSwap is one of the applications built on top of deBridge that enables capital-efficient cross-chain swaps)\n- Bridging of any arbitrary asset and data\n- Interoperability and bridging of NFTs\n\nIn deBridge, we strongly believe in the concept of composable finance where a combination of different DeFi primitives or protocols enables solutions with the highest level of capital- efficiency that can’t be achieved by standalone protocols or applications. deBridge was designed to be fully compatible with the existing DeFi ecosystem, and **[deSwap](https://app.debridge.finance/deswap)** is a good example of this. It leverages deBridge’s generic messaging framework in order to provide users and protocols with the ability to perform a capital-efficient cross-chain conversion between arbitrary liquid assets, all in one transaction\n\nMore information about deSwap can be found **[here](https://blog.debridge.finance/any-arbitrary-cross-chain-swaps-with-debridge-1inch-network-862212087d6a)**. \n\n\nInstead of reinventing the wheel and developing a dedicated AMM or DEX, we integrated with Curve to utilize its capital-efficient stableswap AMM and partnered up and integrated with the liquidity aggregator 1inch. This design allows deSwap to source liquidity and routing from existing protocols. This is much more effective than running meaningless liquidity mining campaigns to have a ton of idle liquidity sitting as TVL with near-zero utilization. We truly believe it's more reasonable to source liquidity from a protocol like AAVE when it's needed and to do revenue sharing between the protocols. \n\n**Portals enable a great synergy between deBridge and AAVE** by bringing additional utilization for locked liquidity in AAVE as well as providing a new type of routing for cross-chain swaps through deSwap, where no intermediary pools or wrapped tokens are needed. In addition, the integration will facilitate atomic transfers of positions between Aave instances on different chains which ease cross-chain interactions with no need to switch wallets/networks.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\ndeBridge is an infrastructure for developers and projects to integrate with or use to build any type of cross-chain applications and primitives. The design of the deBridge protocol consists of two layers:\nProtocol layer – on-chain smart contracts deployed on every blockchain supported by deBridge.\nInfrastructure layer – off-chain validation nodes operated by validators that are elected by and work for deBridge governance. (List of active validators can be found [here](https://explorer.debridge.finance/validation-progress).\n\nMore details about the technical implementation and design of the deBridge protocol can be found in our [documentation portal](https://docs.debridge.finance/).\n\nThe protocol has been live since February and has processed over $45M in volume, 80k+ cross-chain transactions, 45k+ unique users, and generated over $120,000 in fees for the protocol and validators securing the network. \n\nThe major activity in the protocol has been generated by deSwap, a cross-chain swap solution built on top of the deBridge generic messaging protocol. deSwap enables decentralized cross-chain conversion of arbitrary liquid assets. Here is some useful information: \n\n**If applicable the number of routers, total liquidity of routers**\nCross-chain swaps are currently routed through the deUSDC/deETH liquidity pools at Curve protocol which have ~$9M of liquidity provided by deBridge users and partners. A complete list of liquidity pools can be found here: Cross-Chain Swaps Liquidity - deBridge\n\n**Is liquidity incentivized?**\nAt this moment liquidity is not incentivized. Liquidity providers receive 2 BPs in the form of trading fees from Curve. Anyone can provide liquidity to the protocol.\n\nOnce control over the protocol is passed to governance, there is a plan to submit a governance proposal to the deBridge DAO to retroactively reward participants proportionally to how they have helped out the protocol in the early stages\n\n**Is there a fee model for participants?**\n\nThe protocol takes a 10bps fee from every transaction (5bps go to validators and their delegators that help to secure the protocol, and another 5 bps go to deBridge treasury)\n\nLink to analytics dashboard of protocol: https://explorer.debridge.finance/\n\nDune dashboard: https://dune.com/mak5577/DeBridge\n\nBridge and cross-chain swaps for users: https://app.debridge.finance/\n\nTechnical documentation: https://docs.debridge.finance/\n\nAt this stage cross-chain swaps are routed through the intermediary deUSDC pool at Curve which sets the maximal amount of swap being limited by liquidity in the pool (https://docs.debridge.finance/deswap/cross-chain-swaps-liquidity). The credit line provided by Portals will solve this problem by enabling new routings and more capital-efficient cross-chain swaps with larger transactions, limited only by the amount of the credit line.\nOne of the unique features of deBridge is the cross-chain \"transactions bundling\" where an arbitrary set of actions can be packed into one cross-chain interaction, e.g. users can do a cross-chain swap and supply the resulting liquidity to AAVE. \nThe liquidity from Portals will be used in various scenarios:\n1) Facilitate liquidity inflow into AAVE v3 on different chains so users can supply liquidity using any arbitrary asset on any chain supported by deBridge.\n2) Let anyone automatically transfer positions across instances of AAVE v3 on different chains.\n3) Utilized for routing of cross-chain swaps performed by users/protocols through deSwap.\n4) Any applications and projects that integrate the [deSwap API](https://debridge.finance/api) which will use Portals’ liquidity bringing additional monetization to the AAVE protocol.\n\nWe have prepared for the Aave community an application POC for swap + deposit into AAVE in a single transaction: https://stake-aave.debridge.finance/stake-aave\n\nOnce the deSwap widget is integrated into the AAVE application, all users of the AAVE UI will utilize liquidity of Portals to perform above-mentioned interactions with the protocol. This is an example of ETH liquidity routing on Ethereum which is converted into AVAX and supplied to AAVE on Avalanche:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5cNShm5.png)\n\n\nOnce integrated with Portals, its credit line will be used instead of deUSDC.\n\n## Technical implementation\nIntegration with Portals is to be performed through a dedicated deAaveAdapter smart contract that will be developed by the deBridge team and audited by our security partner Halborn. This smart contract utilizes the deBridge generic messaging protocol and interacts with Portals (AAVE Pools). \n\nIt receives liquidity from the user, then redeems the loan on one chain and takes the same amount of credit to another chain. Whenever users or protocols perform a cross-chain swap, the following set of actions is performed by the smart contract:\n1. Accept liquidity from the sender on chain A (e.g. Arbitrum) and check if there is any unbacked amount to be repaid\n2. Pay the outstanding amount and lock the remaining liquidity in the deAaveAdapter\n3. Send a message to the deAaveAdapter on chain B (e.g. Polygon) through deBridge. The message contains a command to take a loan, redeem aToken and transfer liquidity to the receiver\n\nOnce the transaction initiated on Chain A is final and irreversible, the deBridge infrastructure will execute the transaction on the destination Chain B in the following sequence:\n1. Execution of the passed message in the external call to deAaveAdapter\n2. deAaveAdapter will mint the needed amount of aTokens by calling mintUnbacked function of Portals\n3. deAaveAdapter will redeem received aTokens and transfer the resulting tokens to the receiver by calling withdraw method of AAVE protocol\n\nThis design of deAaveAdapter guarantees that the liquidity lent from Portals on one chain is always backed by the same amount of asset locked in deAaveAdapter on another chain. By this design, liquidity that was lent to deSwap always remains in AAVE’s possession as any user/protocol can bridge assets from the chain with an outstanding loan to unlock the corresponding amount of the same asset locked in the deAaveAdapter on another chain. \nThis diagram shows the general flow of a cross-chain interaction when deSwap will be integrated with Portals:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QoCmmH9.png)\n\n## Proposed list Credit Line request\nThe credit lines to be allocated to deBridge are requested for each blockchain where AAVE v3 is deployed. deBridge is currently deployed on 6 blockchains and one of the reasons we haven’t deployed on others has been the lack of liquidity for deSwap. Portal is solving this problem and deBridge will prioritize integration to have the list of supported blockchains matching those where Portals are deployed.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Llsbqfn.png)\n\nThe maximal amount of the cross-chain swap that can be performed by users and protocols in one transaction is capped by the amount of approved credit line. deBridge will pay a 2bps fee on all the liquidity taken from the Portals\n \n#### Incentives\nAn incentive program may be approved by the deBridge DAO after the deBridge token goes live.\n\n### Audits & Security\nList of relevant security audits of the network\nSecurity has always been our main priority. deBridge has passed four independent security audits by reputable companies such as \n- Halborn \n- Zokyo\n- Ackee Blockchain\n- Neodyme \n\nAll security audit reports can be found on our [Github](https://github.com/debridge-finance/debridge-security).\n\ndeBridge has a long-term partnership with [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) that audits not only smart contracts but all the modules created for the protocol. \nWe also have an ongoing bug bounty program on Immunefi:\nhttps://immunefi.com/bounty/debridge/\n\nWe have done extensive research and seen that many bridges are missing various security measures like basic balance sheet validation and nonce sequence validation. These crucial components among others have been implemented in deBridge. More details about our cross-chain security strategies can be found here:\nhttps://blog.debridge.finance/10-strategies-for-cross-chain-security-8ed5f5879946\n\n#### Has the Entity experienced outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks? on which Networks?\nNever\n\n## VOTING\n### FOR:\nDO Approve Credit Lines for deBridge\n\n### AGAINST:\nDO NOT Approve Credit Lines for deBridge\n",

        "body": "Deploy Aave on Cronos chain\n\nThe following proposal follows the ARC draft proposal posted for comments [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploy-aave-v3-on-cronos-chain/7287), more than 5 days ago, that follows the standard governance process framework.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nLaunched in 2021 after years of open-source R&D, Cronos is #9 public blockchain by DeFi value locked according to  [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chains)  (around 2.5 B$ TVL to date). Cronos proposes to deploy Aave V3 to the Cronos chain and to incentivize liquidity in order to help fulfill the promise of a multi-chain future.\n\nCronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. An open-source Layer 1 chain launched under the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  umbrella, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp (Web3) user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos, the majority via a centralized exchange. Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project: as [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  customers, as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem, and/or as [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  project supporters. These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3. For them, Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of self-custody, Ethereum and DeFi.\n\nThe cross-chain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3, resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users. Therefore, Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3.\n\n**Technical specifications of the network**\n\n*Network specifications*\n\n[Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/)  is an open-source project launched by  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  that brings together many  [open-source initiatives](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/blob/main/go.mod#L22)  of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).\n\nCronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called  [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/charts)  , as well as on  [Defillama for TVL data](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos)  .\n\nAt the protocol level, Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validator’s voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocol’s staking token. There are currently 26 live validators, with room for more. The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds, low transaction fees (usually below 1 USD) paid in CRO token, and small environmental footprint.\n\nUsers and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSON-RPC  [endpoints](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  . They can deploy any EVM-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, and can use all the usual end-user and developer tooling: MetaMask, Etherscan block explorer ([Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/) ), Gnosis Safe, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.\n\nThe Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations, specifically the Chainlink oracle, The Graph indexer, and commercial and JSON-RPC endpoints for Dapps (in addition to the existing  [free ones](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  ). These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project. A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022. Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects.\n\nThere are several bridges between Cronos and other networks :\n\n* [Live] Fast withdrawals from and to the  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  app and exchange.\n* [Upcoming] Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology, currently in testing and planned for imminent launch.\n* [Live] IBC transfers from and to the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  chain, Cosmos Hub, and Terra, with more IBC-compatible chains on the roadmap.\n* [Live] EVM smart contract-based transfers from and to BSC, Polygon, and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges, with more to come.\n* Security review of additional bridges is under way.\n\nCronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  [contributors](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  ,  [validators](https://cronos.crypto.org/partners)  , and  [Dapp developers](https://cronos.crypto.org/ecosystem)  . This includes 2 large AMM/DEXes, VVS Finance (1.4 B$ TVL) and MM Finance (320 M$ TVL).\n\nThe  [roadmap](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254)  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations, further connectivity and interoperability, best-in-class tooling and infrastructure, further protocol governance decentralization, dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps, and longer term plans to increase scalability.\n\n*Aave V3 implementation*\n\nAs part of this proposal, Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol, given that Cronos is fully EVM-compatible. Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer (implementation under way).\n\nThe Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVM-based cross-chain bridges (such as Connext and others, subject to further testing and security review) for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens.\n\n*Metrics and references*\n\nChain data as of Feb 15, 2022:\n* 26 live validators.\n* 15+ M transactions to date (no transaction pumping!)\n* 150,000 to 200,000 transactions per day, with potential to increase by 5x to 20x in the short term.\n* 350,000 unique wallets.\n* More than 120 Dapps deployed in the last 3 months, including VVS (DEX, 1.4 B$ TVL), MM Finance (DEX, 320 M$ TVL), Tectonic (decentralized lending, 275 M$ TVL), and others.\n\nAudience data\n*  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cronos_chain)  : 130k followers.\n*  [Telegram](https://t.me/Cryptoorg_Chain_Announcements)  : 7k subscribers.\n*  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pahqHz26q4)  : 19,000 members.\n\nLinks\n*  [Cronos website](https://cronos.crypto.org/) \n*  [Particle B ecosystem development program](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-ecosystem-grants-7a4a2de3b721) \n*  [Blockchain explorer](https://cronoscan.com/) \n*  [Particle B accelerator](https://www.particleb.com/) \n*  [Cronos integration documentation](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html) \n*  [Github](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  repository\n*  [Overview of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/nodes/)  node architecture\n\n**Proposed list of initial collaterals**\n\nThe proposed list of initial collaterals is: CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, ATOM, LUNA, DOT.\n\nAs indicated above, Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment.\n\nCronos already supports the  [following cross-chain assets](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#integration-guide-for-cronos-mainnet-beta)  : CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, SHIB, DOGE, ATOM, LINK, ENJ, ELON, TUSD, LUNA, DOT, BIFI, with more to come. Additional native tokens include VVS, TONIC. These tokens have between 10 M$ and 700 M$ of liquidity on Cronos. Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M$.\n\nThe proposed tokens have more than, or close to, 2 M$ daily volume each. With respect to DEX statistics, see  [VVS analytics](https://vvs.finance/info)  for history and liquidity per token.\n\n**Incentives**\n\nParticle B, the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain, has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development. A portion of these funds will be allocated to end-user incentives, commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos.\n\nIn our experience, the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions, hence the exact programs and amounts (expected to be worth several M$) will need to be refined over time.\n\n**Audits and security**\n\nCronos mainnet was launched in November 2021 and has not experienced outages so far.\n\nAn audit of relevant components of the underlying Ethermint codebase (  [crypto](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/crypto)  ,  [JSON RPC](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/ethereum/rpc)  ,  [Ante handler](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/app)  ,  [EVM state transition](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go)  ) was commissioned by Foris Ltd and completed by Kudelski Security. It is published in the Cronos Github repository ([link](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/tree/main/docs/audit)).\n\nA bug bounty program is  [published](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/)  , with a bounty of up to 1.3 M$.\n\nThank you for your support !",

        "body": "**Author**: Jarvis Network Core Team\n**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)\n\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.\n\n# About Jarvis Network\nSynthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.\n\njFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.\n\nThe protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.\n\nWe have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).\n\nCombined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).\n\nWe also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.\n\njEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.\n\nWe debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.\n\nThe protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:\n\n- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).\n- $78M of volume on our primary market.\n- 33k swaps by 9k users.\n- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).\n- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).\n- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.\n- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.\n\n# Benefits for Aave V3\n### Fiat on and off-ramp\njEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.\n\nWe have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).\n\nHaving jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.\n\n### Large addressable market\nA part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).\n\n### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins\njEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.\n\n### DDM\njEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.\n\n### Low risk collateral\nAs collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.\n\njEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.\n\njEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.\n\n\n# Risk Parameters\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:\n\n1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.\n\n# Security specification and risks\n\n### Risks inherent to jEUR\nBesides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.\n\njEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.\n\n\n[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)\n\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.\njEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.\n\nThere is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.\n\nIt does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.\n\n### Audits\nWe have had two different audits by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and [Ubik](https://ubikgroup.co/): [Read the audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/security)\n\n# Data\n\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap: €3.5M circulating ($4M)\n- 24h Volume: $2M on our primary market, $400k on secondary markets\n- Volatility: Low\n- Maturity: Early\n\n### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n- Discord: 3k members\n- Twitter: 16.1k followers\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: Sep 2021 (Polygon)\n- Number of Transactions: 116k transactions including 30k swaps on our primary market and 22k on secondary markets.\n- Number of holders for token: 3,242 (more holders possible due to farming programs)\n\n# Links\n- Website: [https://jarvis.network](https://jarvis.network)\n- Dune: [Jarvis Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/0xroll/JarvisNetwork)\n- Docs: [https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network)\n- Code: [https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network)\n\n# Voting options\n- YES, add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n- NO, do not add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.\n\n# Motivation\n\nStaking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n[Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/jgf1/Stakewise)\n[Audits - Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)\n[Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n[Medium](https://stakewise.medium.com/)\n[Github Page\n](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts)[sETH2 contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a)\n[StakeWise dual tokenomics](https://stakewise.medium.com/the-tokenomics-of-staking-pools-what-are-staked-eth-tokens-and-how-do-they-work-2b4084515711)\n[StakeWise Metro Upgrade](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8)\n\nCommunities: [Discord](https://discord.gg/vM3a3csBDS) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n# Specifications\n\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nI (Jordan Sutcliffe) am the BizDev Lead at StakeWise, submitting the proposal on behalf of StakeWise DAO.\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\n->*StakeWise Overview*\n\nStakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.\n\nETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).\n\nAs a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.\n\nDmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).\n\nStakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).\n\n->*sETH2 Overview*\n\nsETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.\n\nsETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.\n\n**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.\n\nsETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.\n\nsETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nStakeWise’s background is detailed above.\n\nStakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\nInvestors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.\n\nThe StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nFirst and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.\n\nCreating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\n-> *Multi-sigs*\n\nStakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).\n\nThe DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.\n\n1.

The DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n**Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nMarket Cap ~$167M\n\nVolatility -\n\nsETH2 has proven peg stability. Superimposing stETH / ETH with sETH2 / ETH highlights this stability when compared against stETH which is already whitelisted for Aave.\n\n![|624x205](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV-tgDKkGvUmpr9MP6D9-qWNApCsLGrTiBqlIGL3K4IfXl2MB--glv35OerGGzZteAOZaAtbKVkCsGhGUuzgxD4JWBDpv76zk0QkfRaEMpIGAuuOuo1Ot6Ey8GF6qRC6c3JHTA60)\n\nNote that StakeWise will soon be adjusting the main UniSwap pool by reducing the fee tier from 0.3% to 0.01%, which is expected to close the remaining gap between sETH2 and ETH. StakeWise is also in the process of launching a new pool on Curve which will further increase sETH2’s peg resilience.\n\n**Volumes and DEXs**\n\n-> [UniSwap V3 Pool (sETH2/ETH)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)\n\nLiquidity: $160M\n\nVolume (24h): ~$350k on avg.\n\n-> [Curve Pool (sETH2/stETH)](https://curve.fi/factory/105)\n\nThis pool is in the final stages of being set up, with the addition of a liquidity gauge ([gauge proposal](https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/165)) passing recently and at least 5k ETH of seed liquidity to be added ([proposal here](https://snapshot.fei.money/#/proposal/0xa4115f24e824b09109991e1e369ba48c60921f503fe3efa4b39d4612eeb51533)).\n\n-> StakeWise is in discussions with multiple other protocols to create further liquidity pools with a diverse range of assets.

Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.\n\n4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).\n\nAs previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.\n\n-> *Staking risks*\n\nsETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:\n\n* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.\n* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.\n* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).\n\nNote that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.\n\nStakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.\n\n-> *Smart Contract Risks*\n\nStakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).\n\nDespite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.\n\n-> *Price Oracles*\n\nsETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.\n\n# Proposed Risk Parameters\n\n* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)\n* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)\n\nThe proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.\n\n### Interest Rate Model:\n\nUOptimal: 50%\nBase: 0%\nSlope 1: 8%\nSlope 2: 200%\n\n",

Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.\n\n# Motivations\nLaunched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):\n\nTotal trading volume: $160B\nTotal swaps: 5.91M\nTotal users: 1.25M\n\n1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.\n\nThe mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.\n\nIn December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.\n\n# Benefits to Aave Community\n\n1INCH is highly liquid.\n1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.\n1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.\n\n# Resources\nWebsite: 1inch.io\nToken: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302 4\nGovernance Forum\nDiscord Chat\nGithub\nDocumentation\nBlog\nTwitter\nCoingecko\nDune analytics\n\n# Specification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\nRoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.\n\n1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.\n\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.\n\nOn the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\n1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.\n\n1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.\n\n1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.\n\nP2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.\n1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.\n\nSupported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.\n\n# How is the asset currently used?\n\n1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3\n\n#Emission schedule\n\nThe 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.\n\nOf the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).\n\nUncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).\n\n# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nThe smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.\n\nThe 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.\n\n# Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $548M circulating, $1.98B FDV\n24h Volume: $50M\nExchanges: CoinGecko | CoinMarketCap\nDEX:\nUniswap V3 1 | $9.9M TVL | $176k 24h Trading Volume\n1inch Liquidity Protocol | $3.4M TVL\nUniswap V2 | $0.5M TVL\n\n# Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nTwitter 2: 1.0M\nDiscord: 15.8k\nTelegram [EN]: 25.9k\nReddit: 7.9k\nGithub\n\n# Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment (Token): Dec-23-2020\nNumber of Transactions: 580k+\nNumber of Holders: 87k\n\n# Risk Factors\n# 1INCH - Risk Assessment\n\n## Smart Contract Risk Counterparty Risk Market Risk Overall Risk\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-04 at 19.47.49.png](ipfs://bafkreie6zbinxzt2fufyo76ha7tb7mbbjwir2mgougsnbgqjg2x7ymiobm)\n    \n\n## General\n\nThe 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.\n\n* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.\n* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.\n* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.\n  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.\n  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.\n  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.\n\nThe 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nDAO Treasury: 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07\n1inch Foundation: 0x5E89f8d81C74E311458277EA1Be3d3247c7cd7D1\n1INCH: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302\nst1INCH: 0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba\nv1INCH: 0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2\nChainlink Oracle: 0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8\n\n## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:\n\nThe 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M\n\nThe 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.\n\nThe 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.\n\nOn April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.\n\nThere is an extensive list of audits available on Github.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nAudits: https://github.com/1inch/1inch-v2-audits\n1inch Genesis: 0x9825b9f083ba43112afd66dbcfbbf770e24bc21ff4128ce24ddbda171d79ae2f\nBurn 1INCH Key Transaction: 0x8799998e32cf58f4939a1fb21b3e679f1cc4598b26b73bfea6f265fa5426d511\n\n## 1INCH Counterparty Risk:\n\n1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program.\n\nThe st1INCH token is used for governing the DAO and although there is no revenue sharing like with xSUSHI there are economic rewards/incentives for those who hold the token. st1INCH token holders receive up to 100% of gas expenses refunded, depending on your stake size. Under this program, 1INCH tokens are distributed as a gas refund to Ethereum users who stake 1INCH tokens through the 1INCH dApp. Borrowing 1INCH with the intent to receive a gas refund is a useful utility.\n\nUsers who stake 1INCH receive st1INCH which is non transferrable and used for governance. If a malicious actor was to borrow 1INCH, stake to receive st1INCH and then try attack the DAO’s treasury, then the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72 hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote. This measure provides a level of protection for the DAO’s Treasury funds which are nominated in USDC. Any malicious attack on the DAO Treasury would not lead to the actor selling 1INCH on-market and this scenario would not create bad debt by moving the spot price of 1INCH.\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n\nRisk parameters can be found on the forum thread linked below.
