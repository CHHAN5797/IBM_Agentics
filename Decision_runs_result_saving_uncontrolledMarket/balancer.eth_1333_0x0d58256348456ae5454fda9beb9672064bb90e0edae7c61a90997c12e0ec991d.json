It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs\n\nKelp has more than 113,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 14,000 users. All of this is within 7 weeks of launching on Mainnet.\n\nBy providing liquidity for the restaked positions, rsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nKelp is seeking to establish the [rsETH/ETHx on Mainnet] and [WETH/rsETH on Polygon zkEVM] on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of rsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon\n\n2. **Oracles:** Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.\n\n3. **Audits:** Kelp's smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena. \nSigma Prime Report: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/SigmaPrime.pdf\nCode4rena: https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-11-kelp\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\nOur goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.\n\n5. **Market History:** Kelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 113k ETH and >14,000 holders of rsETH.\n \nThe balancer pools are already live and are available here: \n\n[Mainnet Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) \n[Polygon zkEVM Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/zkevm/pool/0xffc865fcb34e754fad4b0144139b9c28c81c3eff00000000000000000000005f)\n\nGauges: \n[Mainnet Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BcDb6d9b27Bd62d3De605393902C7d1a2c71Aab?)\n[Polygon zkEVM Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x047301b311741ce6C007FFEF7f182Ec93ab07968#readContract  )\n\n6. **Value:** The balancer pool is the first liquidity pool on Polygon zkEVM and is aimed at providing liquidity to the growing community.\n\n**Technical Specifications:**\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x0BcDb6d9b27Bd62d3De605393902C7d1a2c71Aab`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address):`0x047301b311741ce6C007FFEF7f182Ec93ab07968`\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon zkEVM`",

This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/949\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Base, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Base: 0x99aC4484e8a1dbd6A185380B3A811913Ac884D87\n\nsDAI / aUSDC Base pool on Gyro: https://app.gyro.finance/pools/base/e-clp/0x821afe819450a359e29a5209c48f2fa3321c8ad2/\n\nChild chain gauge: [https://basescan.org/address/0x6A3F93bB18fbdDea76169D3D94d03371E9e0DdC4#code]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1\n\ngaugeType(string): Base",
