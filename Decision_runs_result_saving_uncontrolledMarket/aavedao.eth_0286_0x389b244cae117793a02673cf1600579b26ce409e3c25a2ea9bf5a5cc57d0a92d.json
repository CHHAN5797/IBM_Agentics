        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to increase OP’s liquidation threshold and LTV on Aave V3 Optimism.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOP is currently configured with a liquidation threshold (LT) of 40% and max loan-to-value (LTV) of 30%. These parameters were intentionally [set](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-op-as-collateral-to-aave-v3/9087/18) conservatively and in isolation mode, when the asset was first listed to ensure mechanisms were working as intended. In [October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/337/), OP was removed from isolation mode. Following our observations, we believe it prudent to increase the LT and LTV for OP.\n\nOP's average market cap over the past 180 days is $1.78BN, and its daily average volume is $192M.\n\nIt has registered a daily annualized volatility of 98.53%, a 30-day annualized volatility of 92.6%, and its largest single-day price drop was 17.7%.\n\n3.7M of the 7.4M OP supplied is supplied by a single [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x790c9422839fd93a3a4e31e531f96cc87f397c00), who also maintains large positions on Arbitrum and Ethereum. Their last deposit on Optimism was 252K OP on March 12; they repaid $1M USDT on April 6 and currently hold a health score of 2.02.\n\nThe majority of assets borrowed against OP collateral are stablecoins. That puts these positions at risk of liquidation in the event OP’s price moves falls.\nHowever, collateral at risk does not exceed $100K until OP’s price falls to $2.13, a 35% drop from current levels.\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend first aligning OP’s parameters with ARB’s on Arbitrum (50% LTV and 60% LT), an asset with a similar supply distribution and liquidity profile. Following observations at these levels and utilizing our simulation platform, these parameters may be further optimized.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Recommended LTV | Current LT | Recommended LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Optimism | OP | 30.00% | 50.00% | 40.00% | 60.00% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to increase the debt ceiling of MKR on V3 Ethereum\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum, set at $6M, has reached 100% utilization. \n\nGiven current market conditions and improved liquidity for MKR on Ethereum over the past months, our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling for MKR to $8.5M. \n\nIt is important to note that the majority of MKR debt positions are concentrated within two accounts, accounting for over 80% of the total debt, as outlined below. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0) -  borrowing $3.11M DAI against his 5,914 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 52% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2. [0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05) -  borrowing $1.84M USDC against his 4,077 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 31% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 2.06.\n\n## Specification:\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | Debt Ceiling | 6,000,000 | 8,500,000 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

With consideration of the current usage on Aave and existing liquidity, we recommend implementing the following updates:\n\n1. Set supply caps at the current supply in each deployment\n2. Set borrow cap at the current borrow in each deployment\n3. Set Debt Ceiling at 2*(Liquidity within LB range / MAI LT)\n\n*Note: Final recommendations will be rounded for simplicity*\n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Chain | Current Supply Cap | Recommended Supply Cap | Current Borrow Cap | Recommended Borrow Cap | Current Debt Ceiling ($) | Recommended Debt Ceiling ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Avalanche | 700,000 | 20,000 | 460,000 | 10,000 | 2,000,000 | 10,000 |\n\n\n*Note: Given the current usage on Polygon, these recommendations effectively disable further usage of MAI as collateral.*\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

As per this plan, Chaos Labs proposes to list USDP on Aave V3 on Ethereum. USDP is currently listed on V2 Ethereum as a non-collateral asset.\n\n### Liquidity and Market Cap\n\nWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at data from the past 180 days. The average market cap of USDP over the past 180 days was ~$883M, and the average daily trading volume was ~$8.7M (CeFi & DeFi). \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicffv66o5w2u2l6vdu6u2mfdobf4dgnla2k42osux3s7pycwyuj6m)\n    \n\n### **Liquidation Threshold**\n\nAnalyzing USDP price volatility over the past, we observed daily annualized volatility of 2.79% and 30-day annualized volatility of 1.63%. Considering this volatility and the history of USDP on other networks, we recommend an initial LT of 75%.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifydbyneeuh24uqgfmss6u3ppuyqevx6eyau44dpmgfurrtoj4h6a)\n    \n\nWe recommend listing USDP as borrowable, as we do not observe a significant risk to the protocol by allowing to borrow of USDP, as long as it is bound by a well-defined cap.\n\n### **Debt Ceiling**\n\nFollowing [Chaos Labs’ Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440), we recommend an initial debt ceiling of $3.3M. Under the methodology for Isolation Mode, we consider two levels of probabilities for extreme price drops - Medium-High and High. We estimate the probability of an extreme price drop for USDP as Medium-High. Given this debt ceiling, we do not identify a profitable attack vector under the current liquidity levels.\n\n### **Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and Liquidation Bonus**\n\nWhen evaluating the initial supply caps for migrated assets from Aave V2 Market, we carefully analyze the latest supply for the asset and consider it as the demand for supplying the asset. We then ensure that this amount is aligned with the current liquidity on-chain. \n\nFurthermore, we take into account the debt ceiling calculated using our methodology and derive a supply cap that aligns with the debt ceiling. This approach is aimed at minimizing the risks associated with listing assets while ensuring that the supply cap is aligned with the overall liquidity of the platform and the potential risks that the asset might pose to the protocol.\n\nAccordingly, We recommend a supply cap of 5M USDP and a borrow cap of 4M USDP.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiepqthcxzlsc3zuuibihdcrlcmnr26t3bk2ne63wow2ulxqtysfqe)\n    \n\nGiven the concentrated liquidity of USDP, we recommend a 5% Liquidation Bonus.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihoqvhbm6yzcd5v4f4wexexebeyvrskltejfr5u373jvx7vsv5ttm)\n    \n\nFor the **Reserve Factor**, **Liquidation Protocol Fee**, and **Interest Rate curves**, we recommend aligning the parameters to the other stablecoins currently on Ethereum V3.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: USDP\n\nContract Address: [0x8E870D67F660D95d5be530380D0eC0bd388289E1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8e870d67f660d95d5be530380d0ec0bd388289e1)\n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (USDP) | 5M |\n| Borrow Cap (USDP) | 4M |\n| Debt Ceiling | $3.3M |\n| LTV | 70.00% |\n| LT | 75.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5.00% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 75.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 80.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.
