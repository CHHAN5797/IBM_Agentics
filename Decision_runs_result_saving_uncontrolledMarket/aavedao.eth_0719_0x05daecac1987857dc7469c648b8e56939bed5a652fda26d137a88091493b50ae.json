        "body": "Deploy Aave on Cronos chain\n\nThe following proposal follows the ARC draft proposal posted for comments [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploy-aave-v3-on-cronos-chain/7287), more than 5 days ago, that follows the standard governance process framework.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nLaunched in 2021 after years of open-source R&D, Cronos is #9 public blockchain by DeFi value locked according to  [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chains)  (around 2.5 B$ TVL to date). Cronos proposes to deploy Aave V3 to the Cronos chain and to incentivize liquidity in order to help fulfill the promise of a multi-chain future.\n\nCronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. An open-source Layer 1 chain launched under the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  umbrella, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp (Web3) user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos, the majority via a centralized exchange. Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project: as [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  customers, as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem, and/or as [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  project supporters. These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3. For them, Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of self-custody, Ethereum and DeFi.\n\nThe cross-chain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3, resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users. Therefore, Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3.\n\n**Technical specifications of the network**\n\n*Network specifications*\n\n[Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/)  is an open-source project launched by  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  that brings together many  [open-source initiatives](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/blob/main/go.mod#L22)  of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).\n\nCronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called  [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/charts)  , as well as on  [Defillama for TVL data](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos)  .\n\nAt the protocol level, Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validator’s voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocol’s staking token. There are currently 26 live validators, with room for more. The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds, low transaction fees (usually below 1 USD) paid in CRO token, and small environmental footprint.\n\nUsers and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSON-RPC  [endpoints](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  . They can deploy any EVM-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, and can use all the usual end-user and developer tooling: MetaMask, Etherscan block explorer ([Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/) ), Gnosis Safe, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.\n\nThe Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations, specifically the Chainlink oracle, The Graph indexer, and commercial and JSON-RPC endpoints for Dapps (in addition to the existing  [free ones](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  ). These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project. A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022. Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects.\n\nThere are several bridges between Cronos and other networks :\n\n* [Live] Fast withdrawals from and to the  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  app and exchange.\n* [Upcoming] Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology, currently in testing and planned for imminent launch.\n* [Live] IBC transfers from and to the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  chain, Cosmos Hub, and Terra, with more IBC-compatible chains on the roadmap.\n* [Live] EVM smart contract-based transfers from and to BSC, Polygon, and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges, with more to come.\n* Security review of additional bridges is under way.\n\nCronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  [contributors](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  ,  [validators](https://cronos.crypto.org/partners)  , and  [Dapp developers](https://cronos.crypto.org/ecosystem)  . This includes 2 large AMM/DEXes, VVS Finance (1.4 B$ TVL) and MM Finance (320 M$ TVL).\n\nThe  [roadmap](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254)  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations, further connectivity and interoperability, best-in-class tooling and infrastructure, further protocol governance decentralization, dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps, and longer term plans to increase scalability.\n\n*Aave V3 implementation*\n\nAs part of this proposal, Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol, given that Cronos is fully EVM-compatible. Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer (implementation under way).\n\nThe Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVM-based cross-chain bridges (such as Connext and others, subject to further testing and security review) for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens.\n\n*Metrics and references*\n\nChain data as of Feb 15, 2022:\n* 26 live validators.\n* 15+ M transactions to date (no transaction pumping!)\n* 150,000 to 200,000 transactions per day, with potential to increase by 5x to 20x in the short term.\n* 350,000 unique wallets.\n* More than 120 Dapps deployed in the last 3 months, including VVS (DEX, 1.4 B$ TVL), MM Finance (DEX, 320 M$ TVL), Tectonic (decentralized lending, 275 M$ TVL), and others.\n\nAudience data\n*  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cronos_chain)  : 130k followers.\n*  [Telegram](https://t.me/Cryptoorg_Chain_Announcements)  : 7k subscribers.\n*  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pahqHz26q4)  : 19,000 members.\n\nLinks\n*  [Cronos website](https://cronos.crypto.org/) \n*  [Particle B ecosystem development program](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-ecosystem-grants-7a4a2de3b721) \n*  [Blockchain explorer](https://cronoscan.com/) \n*  [Particle B accelerator](https://www.particleb.com/) \n*  [Cronos integration documentation](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html) \n*  [Github](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  repository\n*  [Overview of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/nodes/)  node architecture\n\n**Proposed list of initial collaterals**\n\nThe proposed list of initial collaterals is: CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, ATOM, LUNA, DOT.\n\nAs indicated above, Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment.\n\nCronos already supports the  [following cross-chain assets](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#integration-guide-for-cronos-mainnet-beta)  : CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, SHIB, DOGE, ATOM, LINK, ENJ, ELON, TUSD, LUNA, DOT, BIFI, with more to come. Additional native tokens include VVS, TONIC. These tokens have between 10 M$ and 700 M$ of liquidity on Cronos. Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M$.\n\nThe proposed tokens have more than, or close to, 2 M$ daily volume each. With respect to DEX statistics, see  [VVS analytics](https://vvs.finance/info)  for history and liquidity per token.\n\n**Incentives**\n\nParticle B, the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain, has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development. A portion of these funds will be allocated to end-user incentives, commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos.\n\nIn our experience, the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions, hence the exact programs and amounts (expected to be worth several M$) will need to be refined over time.\n\n**Audits and security**\n\nCronos mainnet was launched in November 2021 and has not experienced outages so far.\n\nAn audit of relevant components of the underlying Ethermint codebase (  [crypto](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/crypto)  ,  [JSON RPC](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/ethereum/rpc)  ,  [Ante handler](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/app)  ,  [EVM state transition](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go)  ) was commissioned by Foris Ltd and completed by Kudelski Security. It is published in the Cronos Github repository ([link](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/tree/main/docs/audit)).\n\nA bug bounty program is  [published](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/)  , with a bounty of up to 1.3 M$.\n\nThank you for your support !",

        "body": "From the Aave Governance forum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/request-for-approval-aave-starkware-phase-i/7145)\n\n## Background\nThe discussion about Aave on Starknet [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploying-aave-on-starknet/6726).\n\n\n## Introduction\nA proposal to start bootstrapping the Aave ecosystem over Starkware has received good support from the Aave community, as it allows to expand to a new and promising environment, following the lead of Aave v3 with rollups.\n\nThis bootstrapping was proposed to be executed in 2 phases: an initial one getting in touch with the new technology, while still building something valuable for the Aave and Starknet communities; and a second one, more ambitious, most probably porting Aave v3 to Starknet.\n\nAs the facilitator of the project, I outline on this document the details of Phase I, including scope, time estimation, team members and budget allocation request from the Aave DAO.\n\n\n## Phase I. Scope\n\n### The project. aTokens bridge\nAs explained on the initial post, the target of the initial Phase is simplicity, while adding value for the communities.\n\nOne of the options was to create some kind of pooling model, for people to deposit and withdraw from Aave Ethereum without ever touching Ethereum and its (current) high gas cost. Since that initial proposal, the idea has been refined together with the built team.\n\nPhase I will pursue the same goals as the original pooling idea, but this will be done by building wrappers and smart contracts around the canonical Starknet bridges, for the aTokens of Aave Ethereum. Following similar idea as pioneered by Aavegotchi with maTokens, together with some extra bridging infrastructure on both the Ethereum and Starknet sides, this model will allow to:\n\nBuild the basic blocks for products to integrate easily with Aave from Starknet. Including smart contracts and interaction libraries.\nSolve some interesting and useful challenges, like cross-chain liquidity mining.\nBoost Starknet’s user base, by providing Aave facilities.\nKeep simplicity.\nIn terms of user flow, the system will provide smart contracts infrastructure to:\n\nUsers entering on Starknet via CEXes or on-ramp services to deposit on Aave Ethereum, just by buying an aToken equivalent on Starknet.\nSame for withdrawals, by selling the aToken equivalent on Starknet.\nNew opportunities to liquidity providers to build on top of that, potentially monetising the movement of liquidity between Ethereum and Starknet.\n\n\n### Timeline\nThe project is estimated to take a total of 2 to 3 months, with the variability depending on the implementation of the most experimental aspects, like the cross-chain liquidity mining.\n\nAs part of the facilitator role, I will post bi-weekly updates on the state of the project, informing the community on the progress on all aspects.\n\nA more detailed timeline is the following:\n![Timeline](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/7edbf24a3327584d6bdd5a4da617a801dfd85ba8.jpeg)\n\nThe project start will be marked by the execution of the on-chain proposal requesting the initial funds of the project.\n\n### Team\nSince the initial proposal, multiple teams showed interest on participating on the project. Considering the final scope, the team will be formed by:\n\n- 1 facilitator of the project, part-time.\n- 1 frontend/backend developer, part-time.\n- 3 Cairo/Solidity developers, full-time.\n- 1 Solidity developer part-time (depending on availability and need).\n- **Total**: 3 full time and 2-3 part time.\nThe team is balanced to have expertise on the Aave ecosystem and Starknet.\n\n### Budget breakdown\nSalaries. Covering the full scope of the project, estimated for 3 months and to not be modified unless the final timeline is too short (>1.5 month less) or too long (>1.5 month long).\nGas cost. For deployments of contracts, plus all managerial efforts concerning mainly the payments from the Aave DAO.\nAudit. We plan to engage 2 audit firms, both with EVM/Solidity expertise and at least one with Starknet/Cairo experience.\nBug bounty. Maximum to be spent, but most probably over-estimated if no important issues are found.\nBuffer. 10% of the total budget.\n![budget](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/7fc0a6a7abe4bdc0d0b7295ac8bf002d7dd299fa.png)\n\n\n### Payments\nFor the Starkware part, the payments will be managed as coordinated between the Starknet team, the facilitator and the team members.\n\nFor the Aave part, 2 payments are proposed, to be requested via proposals on the Aave governance:\n\nAt the start of the project, 100’000$ to cover mainly fixed expenses.\nBefore starting audits (beginning Month 3), $92’500.\nAny reconciliation of budget (e.g. return unused funds) will be done at the end of the project, with the bug bounty being kept by the team during 1 year, and then returned to the governance if not used.\n\nGiven the nature of the development, the payment will be done on stable assets from the Aave treasury.\n\n### Deliverables\nSmart contracts (Ethereum/Starknet) for wrapping and bridging of aTokens, fully open source and with a permissive license like MIT.\nFull documentation of the codebase, architecture and model in general.\nPublic audits.\nContinuous update to the community about the project.\n\n### Next steps\n- This Snapshot proposal to ratify the project.\n- If passed, create on-chain proposal to request the initial funds.\n- Start the project development.",

        "author": "0xf3b7BbCe60284E7D9282bc109B35deBA278Ca067",
        "body": "Evmos proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Evmos blockchain to expand lending to the Evmos and greater Cosmos ecosystem. Evmos will be the port of entry to Cosmos for Ethereum users and vice-versa with the introduction of developer-focused incentives, interoperability across other Cosmos chains and interchain composability.\n\n**Summary**\n\nEvmos is an application-agnostic chain that will be interoperable with the Ethereum mainnet, EVM-compatible environments, and other BFT chains via IBC, making it easy for users and developers to interact seamlessly between chains. Rather than being competitive with Ethereum, Evmos aims to expand the functionality of the EVM to offer interoperability that enables new use cases. EVM bridges ([Nomad and Connext](https://evmos.blog/bridging-assets-to-evmos-with-nomad-and-connext-e8ec182145d5)) will integrate with Evmos shortly after mainnet launch to allow Ethereum and other EVM chains’ ERC-20 tokens to be available on Evmos and subsequently the entire Cosmos ecosystem via IBC.\n\nEvmos was founded by Federico Kunze Küllmer and Akash Khosla. Federico has been a core contributor to a number of Cosmos projects including Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, Core IBC, Gravity Bridge (formerly Peggy) and Sommelier. He has been building in the blockchain space since 2017 when he was an exchange student at UC Berkeley, where he joined Blockchain at Berkeley. Akash had been working in the Cosmos ecosystem at Anchorage and as a Co-Founder of Blockchain at Berkeley, the blockchain innovation hub where many of the original Cosmos developers started their careers. He’s been working on blockchain and cryptocurrencies since 2016 as a Software Engineer at Anchorage, Chain and Earn.com, in addition to contributing to open source projects like Interledger.\n\nThe Cosmos ecosystem has been growing steadily with new application-specific chains being launched every week. Interchain DEXes have been deployed on Cosmos, among which Osmosis is already the second-largest DEX token by Market Cap ([source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/osmosis)) and is in the top 10 dexes by volume and TVL despite only being live for six months ([source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/dex)), which demonstrates the rapid growth of activity in Cosmos. By deploying to Evmos, AAVE will be able to capture a significant amount of user activity and fill the need for reliable lending protocols in Cosmos. Evmos will also enable cross-chain applications to leverage AAVE’s liquidity while being deployed to other Cosmos chains such as Terra. All of this growth will be further catalyzed by Evmos’ native usage incentives which will give the Evmos community the opportunity to allocate 25% of the block allocation of EVMOS tokens through governance to support AAVE’s growth and development. Additionally, funds from the community pool can be allocated to liquidity mining incentives through governance.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThere is great potential for synergy between Evmos and Aave. The Evmos ecosystem has been growing quickly with our live testnet and is launching with all of the infrastructure, tools and clients that developers require to deploy their contracts, including node and validator operator services, indexers, oracles, bridges and more.\n\nEvmos goes above and beyond to align with developers and users through its [tokenomics](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b). Two key ways this alignment happens is through fee splits where EIP1559 is modified to give 50% of transaction fees to contract deployers rather than burning it as well as usage incentives which allocate 25% of all newly minted Evmos tokens to a usage incentive pool. This pool is fully controlled by governance enabling the community to allocate incentives for AAVE users. AAVE users have already been included in the Evmos RektDrop which rewards active Cosmos, Osmosis, and Ethereum users. You can read more about Evmos’ novel [tokenomics](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b) and the [RektDrop](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) in our blog.\n\n**References**\n\n💻 Developer Documentation:<https://evmos.dev/>\n\n👾 Official Discord:<https://discord.gg/evmos>\n\n🐙 GitHub:<https://github.com/tharsis/evmos>\n\n🕊 Twitter:<https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg>\n\n📯 Telegram:[@EvmosOrg](https://t.me/EvmosOrg)\n\n📄 Medium:<https://evmos.blog/>\n\n🖥 Evmos Website:[https://evmos.org](https://evmos.org/)\n\n**Specifications**\n\n- What is the link between the author of the proposal and Evmos?\n\n  - The author of this proposal is a core Evmos team member.\n\n- Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token:\n\n  - With a launch planned for February 2022, Evmos is an application-agnostic chain that will be interoperable with the Ethereum mainnet, EVM-compatible environments, and other BFT chains via IBC, making it easy for users and developers to interact seamlessly between chains. Evmos aims to be the port of entry to Cosmos from Ethereum, making it easy to deploy smart contracts that expand interoperability with the Cosmos ecosystem.\n  - Evmos’ native token, EVMOS, is used to secure the Evmos network through staking, to enable governance voting for network decisions, and to pay transactions fees on the network.\n\n  \n\n\n**Evmos and Cosmos Ecosystem Metrics**\n\n- \\>1,300 validators participated in the Evmos incentivized testnet\n\n- 3 native dexes coming to Evmos\n\n- Cosmos Ecosystem Market Cap is valued at over $124.5 billion collectively ([source](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/tokens))\n\n- Osmosis, the primary interchain DEX of Cosmos has the second highest market cap for DEX tokens, being surpassed only by Uniswap\n\n  - Osmosis has a TVL of $1.2B\n\n- IBC usage growth with over 5M IBC transactions over the last 30 days and 600 channels and IBC-enabled chains have a market cap of over $56 billion.\n\n- Over 30 IBC-enabled chains with many more launching in early 2022\n\n\n\n**Audience data**\n\n- Twitter (@EvmosOrg): 31K\n- Telegram (@EvmosOrg): 6.4K\n- Discord (discord.gg/evmos): 25.6K\n\n**Incentives**\n\nOne of the key designs Evmos focused on is offering developer and user incentives natively. While many protocols deploy funds from foundations and make unilateral decisions of which protocols should benefit from them, Evmos offers a governance-controlled usage incentives pool which is funded by 25% of the block emission. This enables the community to allocate a portion of usage incentives to AAVE users to encourage organic growth of the protocol and increase its adoption.\n\nIn 4 years, this will total 200 million Evmos tokens. The size of this pool is large because users are the backbone of any crypto project. Usage Incentive rewards are based on gas spent on contract interactions and rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch (1-week).\n\nIn addition to Usage Rewards, token holders can leverage governance on Evmos to allocate a portion of the community pool to additional liquidity mining rewards. The community pool accounts for 10% of the supply which can be used to fund incentive programs.\n\n**Technical Specifications**\n\nEvmos will have support for The Graph, Gnosis Safe, and we are actively working with Chainlink to finalize support to enable a fully functional Aave v3 deployment by mainnet.\n\n**Initial Supported Assets**\n\n- USDC\n- USDT\n- DAI\n- FRAX\n- AAVE\n- WETH\n- WBTC\n- OSMO\n- EVMOS\n- ATOM\n",

        "author": "0xc31249BA48763dF46388BA5C4E7565d62ed4801C",
        "body": "**Author**: Jarvis Network Core Team\n**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)\n\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.\n\n# About Jarvis Network\nSynthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.\n\njFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.\n\nThe protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.\n\nWe have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).\n\nCombined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).\n\nWe also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.\n\njEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.\n\nWe debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.\n\nThe protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:\n\n- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).\n- $78M of volume on our primary market.\n- 33k swaps by 9k users.\n- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).\n- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).\n- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.\n- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.\n\n# Benefits for Aave V3\n### Fiat on and off-ramp\njEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.\n\nWe have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).\n\nHaving jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.\n\n### Large addressable market\nA part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).\n\n### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins\njEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.\n\n### DDM\njEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.\n\n### Low risk collateral\nAs collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.\n\njEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.\n\njEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.\n\n\n# Risk Parameters\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:\n\n1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.\n\n# Security specification and risks\n\n### Risks inherent to jEUR\nBesides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.\n\njEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.\n\n\n[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)\n\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.\njEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.\n\nThere is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.\n\nIt does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.\n\n### Audits\nWe have had two different audits by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and [Ubik](https://ubikgroup.co/): [Read the audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/security)\n\n# Data\n\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap: €3.5M circulating ($4M)\n- 24h Volume: $2M on our primary market, $400k on secondary markets\n- Volatility: Low\n- Maturity: Early\n\n### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n- Discord: 3k members\n- Twitter: 16.1k followers\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: Sep 2021 (Polygon)\n- Number of Transactions: 116k transactions including 30k swaps on our primary market and 22k on secondary markets.\n- Number of holders for token: 3,242 (more holders possible due to farming programs)\n\n# Links\n- Website: [https://jarvis.network](https://jarvis.network)\n- Dune: [Jarvis Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/0xroll/JarvisNetwork)\n- Docs: [https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network)\n- Code: [https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network)\n\n# Voting options\n- YES, add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n- NO, do not add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n",
