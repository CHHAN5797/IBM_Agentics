        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy a Gnosis DAO Credit Line Aave v3 Instance\n\n**Author:** @ACI and Karpatkey\n\n**Date:** 2024-09-20\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a specific Aave v3 instance to extend a GHO credit line to Gnosis DAO using GNO and wstETH collateral.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGnosis DAO, a long term partner of Aave DAO, has expressed a need for flexible access to stablecoins. This proposal aims to address this need by leveraging Gnosis DAO's treasury holdings as collateral for a GHO credit line funded by Aave DAO. By establishing this credit facility, we can enhance Gnosis DAO's liquidity management capabilities while fostering closer collaboration between Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO.\n\nThe proposed credit line will provide Gnosis DAO with a reliable source of stablecoin liquidity, enabling them to manage their treasury more efficiently and respond quickly to market opportunities or operational needs. This arrangement also presents an opportunity for Aave to expand its services to other DAOs, potentially opening up a new market segment. The credit line will also serve as a proof-of-concept for further customized extension of credit to reputable DAOs and organizations in the industry.\n\nThe GnosisDAO GHO credit line is described by the following conditions:\n\n- **Exclusive Borrower:** Gnosis DAO will be the only borrower in this specialised GHO market.\n- **Collateral Requirements:** GNO and wstETH tokens will be the primary collateral. Other potential collaterals can be considered but must be approved at a later stage.\n- **Risk Parameters:**\n  - Borrowing Rate (BR): DSR rate\n  - Other risk parameters will be discussed and decided upon by relevant service providers in collaboration with GnosisDAO during the ARFC phase of this proposal.\n- **Liquidation Process:** Managed by a designated Aave entity to ensure controlled handling of collateral.\n- **Progressive Cap Increase:** An initial Cap of 5M GHO will be configured\n  - Once the initial cap is utilized and the system operates smoothly for a predefined period (e.g., 1 month), the cap will increase progressively.\n  - The increase will be contingent upon maintaining a healthy average Health Factor (e.g., above 1.5).\n  - Further increases will be evaluated based on ongoing performance metrics and governance approvals.\n\n### Benefits for Aave\n\n- A dedicated GHO borrowing market will increase the demand for GHO and its supply.\n- Generates consistent income from the interest paid on GHO borrowing by Gnosis DAO.\n- GNO is first-class crypto asset that is currently securing the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n- Gnosis DAO will be able to further provide liquidity enhancing GHO's value proposition as DeFi stablecoin in mainnet, and specially once GHO is deployed in GC.\n- GnosisDAO is a reputable DAO with one of the largest treasuries and footprint in DeFi.\n\n### Benefits for Gnosis DAO\n\n- Provides Gnosis DAO with a reliable and sustainable credit line to support its operations and growth.\n- GNO as collateral will increase the treasury's capital efficiency and help in yield generation by borrowing GHO and putting it to use.\n- Tailored risk parameters offer better borrowing conditions compared to other lending markets.\n- Permissioned liquidation within Aave representatives will ensure proper collateral management, minimizing the risk of market manipulation, price volatility and sudden large sell-offs, also protecting Aave from excessive losses.\n- With the implementation of karpatkey's infrastructure and risk management best practices, tooling and monitoring will be put in place to ensure the debt position is properly managed at all times.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Gnosis DAO credit line will implement the following:\n\n- Credit Line Amount: 5 million GHO tokens to start, with the option to size up based on risk service provider feedback and DAO governance process.\n- Collateral Assets: GNO and wstETH\n- Authorized Users: Limited to Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO\n- GHO Borrow Rate: Set to match the current sUSDS rate of 6%\n\nThis credit line will be implemented as a specialized Aave v3 instance with the following key features:\n\n- Customized access controls to ensure only Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO can interact with the instance\n- Tailored risk parameters for GNO and wstETH as collateral assets\n- Regular reporting and monitoring mechanisms to track the usage and health of the credit line. ACI will propose further methods for safe management of this credit line pending further discussions with Gnosis DAO and risk service providers.\n\nBy implementing this credit line, we aim to provide Gnosis DAO with a flexible financial tool that leverages their existing treasury assets while maintaining the security and transparency inherent in Aave.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI did not receive compensation for creating this proposal. ACI and employees are holders and stakers of GNO as well as delegates within the Gnosis ecosystem. Gnosis DAO and Aave also share some service providers including finance service provider Karpatkey.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

        "author": "0xEd039871ec71FBDC3D714517cE97030Dd2E88622",
        "body": "## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 13/09/2024\n\n# Summary\n\n[Superlend](https://www.superlend.xyz/) is building a lending and borrowing aggregator platform that allows users to manage their positions across multiple chains and protocols, always accessing the best APRs for lending and the lowest rates for borrowing. The Superlend project was Initially conceived during the [Etherlink Accelerator in Singapore](https://medium.com/etherlink/the-future-of-defi-insights-from-dca-in-singapore-d543477cdbe6) as a lending and borrowing platform on [Etherlink](https://www.etherlink.com/).\n\nSuperlend's goals include launching their own dedicated money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, while also integrating Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem, such as on Ethereum, Base, and Polygon, into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they are planning to deploy an instance of Aave V3 that will exclusively support ETH and ETH-correlated assets (such as LRTs and LSTs), similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. These deployments and integrations will enable users to seamlessly manage their positions within the robust and secure Aave framework, while also allowing Superlend to offer innovative cross-chain liquidity management features. Additional details for the Arbitrum proposal will be provided in the future as they finalize the risk parameters and asset selection. Leveraging Aave's well-audited and secure infrastructure allows them to accelerate their development without compromising on security, avoiding the complexities and costs associated with building from scratch.\n\nIn recognition of the value provided by the Aave community, Superlend proposes a revenue-sharing model, committing to share 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave V3 codebase has established itself as a cornerstone in the DeFi ecosystem, renowned for its reliability, security, and quality. Successful projects like the Spark Protocol and RealT further affirm Aave's technology and reputation. Superlend's objectives are twofold: launching their own innovative money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, and integrating the various Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (such as those on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to deploy an instance of Aave V3 focused exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to the Lido instance that Aave has deployed on Ethereum. By doing so, they aim to provide users with a cohesive experience that leverages the strength of Aave's framework while also showcasing the unique features and innovations that Superlend can bring to the market.\n\nOne of Superlend's other motivations for deploying on Etherlink and Arbitrum-like chains using the Aave V3 codebase is to enable a feature for their aggregator that allows users to keep their USDC in the best APY protocol across chains with a single click. After extensive testing with the LayerZero-like cross-chain protocol Across+, as well as flash-loan scripts, they discovered that integrating an Aave deployment with the Portal feature activated, along with a third-party bridge provider, could allow users to move their USDC positions from Compound on Arbitrum to Aave on Optimism seamlessly. In this scenario, Superlend markets can serve as a \"temporary station\" where liquidity is parked for a few seconds during the transfer. Before making such a feature live, they would, of course, share it first in the forum and seek feedback when it's ready.\n\nSuperlend's vision aligns with deploying \"friendly\" forks of Aave V3, customized for specific use cases and ecosystems, and integrating these Aave V3 deployments by the Aave DAO as a prominent part of their aggregator. Keeping the open-source ethos at the forefront, they believe it is fair and respectful to seek the Aave community's approval first, ensuring a mutually beneficial path forward for both Aave and Superlend.\n\nAs Aave continues to explore areas like off-chain collateral and new developments such as GHO, projects like Superlend have the opportunity to add value and drive the adoption of Aave's technology. Their proposal to deploy an Aave V3 fork on Etherlink and Arbitrum represents a strategic opportunity to extend Aave's influence within the rapidly evolving cross-chain DeFi landscape. In appreciation of this opportunity, they propose a revenue-sharing model to ensure mutual benefit from this collaboration.\n\nSuperlend has confirmed plans to allocate a portion of its community token supply towards a potential airdrop or distribution specifically for stkAAVE holders, and they wish to leverage the existing set of holders and delegates, aligning with AAVE DAO's governance model. Specific details will be announced closer to the event. Currently, Superlend's priority remains product development and refinement.\n\n# Specification\n\n### Market Deployment\n\n- **Aave V3 Codebase:** Superlend will deploy their money markets on Etherlink and Arbitrum using the Aave V3 codebase. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to focus exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. Additionally, there could be a second market on Arbitrum dedicated to USDC or similar assets to support their cross-chain liquidity management feature, which would use the Aave Portal feature. These markets will operate independently from their aggregator platform but will be fully integrated within the Superlend ecosystem. These deployments are integral to both their goal of launching innovative Superlend markets and their broader strategy to integrate the existing Aave V3 markets deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (e.g., on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator.\n    - Test their proposed deployment that they have live on Etherlink testnet [here](https://testnet.superlend.xyz/).\n    - Find the addresses of their deployed contracts on the testnet [here](https://www.notion.so/Testnet-deploy-sequence-addresses-fd6c3707ece94aabab61d8498a638775?pvs=21).\n- **Revenue Sharing:** Superlend proposes sharing 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO, provided that their quarterly revenue exceeds $200,000. These contributions will be made on a quarterly basis.\n\n### Governance and Risk Management\n\n- **Governance Model:** Initially, the markets will be governed through a 5/8 multi-sig model. As the project matures, they plan to transition to a more decentralized governance structure, aligning with the principles of Aave's governance model.\n- **Risk Management:** Superlend has partnered with [ChainRisk](https://www.chainrisk.xyz/) for continuous risk parameter tuning and will onboard additional partners as needed to ensure comprehensive risk management for these markets.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on the ARFC, escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is favorable, Superlend markets will be deployed on Etherlink and Arbitrum, adhering to the revenue-sharing and governance commitments outlined.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "# [ARFC] TokenLogic + karpatkey Financial Service Providers - Phase II\n\n---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] TokenLogic + karpatkey - Phase II\nAuthor: TokenLogic karpatkey\nCreated: 2024-07-16\n\n---\n\n![TL + kpk 2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkwva6C80.jpg)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes the continuation of the collaboration with karpatkey and TokenLogic for an additional 6 months, with a proposed budget of 500k GHO. The proposed contributions extend over the three themes detailed below: Treasury Management, GHO adoption and the Aave Stack.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership has created significant value for the Aave DAO across all three focus areas detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/phase-i-summary-karpatkey-tokenlogic/17962). GHO's peg, liquidity, and growth prospects have each improved dramatically over the last 6 months. The DAO's finances are more transparent than ever before and the DAO is firmly positioned for growth.\n\nBuilding on the success of Phase I, we seek to extend our collaboration with the Aave Community for another 6 months. Phase II of our engagement is to focus on enabling GHO and Aave to grow market share through prudent financial management and contributing to numerous growth initiatives. Our three primary focus areas are summarized below:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* GHO Adoption\n* Aave Stack\n\n\n## What to Expect\n\n### Treasury Management\n\n**Asset Management** \n\nThe Aave DAO receives revenue in the form of revenue-generating aTokens for each deployed lending market. Whilst that reduces the need to deploy assets beyond the protocol itself, this creates a need for continual rebalancing of asset holdings.\n\nTo facilitate streamlining routine operational tasks, the [Finance Steward](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570) role, which has been already introduced to the Aave community, will be developed. Given the ability to create allowances, streams, perform transfers, assets bridging, and swaps within pre-approved guidelines and without AIPs, we expect the governance overhead around treasury management to decrease significantly.\n\nThe GHO Finance Steward's capacity to perform swaps will also be improved by the implementation of the [Aave Swap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-swap-upgrade/15311) contract. With this tool, the DAO will be able to acquire assets in a timely and targeted manner, and to support GHO's peg during turbulent market conditions with the ability to create limit orders. \n\n**Financial Security**\n\nA key objective is to define the DAO's annual budget and secure sufficient funds to ensure DAO operations under stressfull market conditions. As the DAO's revenues have exceeded the burn-rate and currently holds more assets (about $145M at [end of June](https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=9&month=6&year=2024&currency=USD)) than planned expenses, this proposal will target to cover a [six months' runway](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/runway) matching holdings with expense tokens or token class as deemed appropriate for capital efficiency. This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Deploying bridging contracts (as required);\n* Bridging Aave funds between networks;\n* Alocating assets for capital efficiency. In particular, migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and\n* Swapping assets to align expenses and holdings.\n\n\n**Aave Analytics**\n\nReporting and analytics functions will be expanded to provide the utmost transparency into the DAO's financial status and overall performance of the protocol, and to support informed decision-making and analysis of the Aave ecosystem. This includes the [Aave Portal](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/) and the [Aave Treasury Report](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), which shows detailed information on DAO holdings and treasury performance.\n\nThe Aave Portal will continue to evolve to showcase the performance of the Aave Protocol and GHO's adoption. Over the next 6 months, the portal will expand to include all revenue sources (incl. Accrued), assets holdings and expenses (incl. budgets) in granular detail, whilst also beginning to include high-level performance tracking across existing covered deployments.\nSeveral legacy community Dune Dashboards will be integrated into the Aave Portal, where they will be maintained and expanded upon over time.\n\n\n### GHO Adoption\n\n**Oversight**\n\nDuring Phase II, GHO's growth is expected to accelerate and expand to several networks. To nurture and maximize the growth potential of GHO, its success hinges on the ability to hold its peg and scale simultaneously.\n\nAs a GHO Steward, we will continue to manage key GHO and GSM configurations, including Borrow Rate, GSM Caps, and GSM fees. As the Treasury Managers, we will ensure the GSM is adequately funded, targetting a collateralization in the range of 5% to 10% of total supply, and that GHO swaps are performed in a manner supportive of retaining a tight peg.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nWe will continue to lead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), overseeing the liquidity growth across different protocols. This includes\n\n* Adjusting liquidity incentives to maintain sufficient market depth;\n* Defining and executing direct liquidity incentives;\n* Leading initiatives that create utility for GHO;\n* Optimizing the utilization of the DAO's strategic voting assets;\n* Supporting GSM Integrations with aggregators;\n* Ensuring GSM are adequately funded;\n* Supporting future D3M, Facilitator, and Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) initiatives; and\n* Support efforts to integrate GHO to Centralized Exchanges, and fund managers.\n\n**Growth**\n\nAs GHO continues to grow beyond Ethereum, our efforts will expand to support those new deployments to ensure adequate liquidity and peg stability is maintained. We will continue to work with teams that build with GHO and advocate for the adoption of GHO wherever practical.\n\nWhen GHO is mature enough to support deploying Protocol Owned Liquidity, we will actively contribute to the creation of sGHO and balancing the needs for sGHO and stkGHO within the Aave ecosystem. \n\n### Aave Stack\n\n**Safety Module Management and Optimisation**\n\nThe Safety Module (SM) currently presents exposure risks due to its reliance on the DAO's native token and its deployment solely on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWith multiple instances of the SM being deployed, we will continue to perform the following:\n\n* Transition from AAVE emissions;\n* Introduce new categories;\n* Amend emission schedules; and,\n* Progressively align protocol exposure with SM holdings; \n\n**Aave Liquidity Network**\n\nWith upcoming changes in the Aave product stack, including the Liquidity Network and the stablecoin's multichain deployment, new challenges will arise in integrating these aspects with other products. We will actively participate in coordination and consulting to support the streamlined and successful deployment of these features.\n\nWhere practical, sunsetting of legacy v2 markets will be supported through continual parameter adjustments to encourage users to migrate to the latest instance of Aave Protocol.\n\n\nBy addressing these challenges, our team aims to support the DAO in achieving sustainable growth and resilience in a rapidly changing environment.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController will be called to create two streams with a start time block 1718673864:\n\n**karpatkey**\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days\nAddress: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\n**TokenLogic**\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses deployment and testings costs.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond the Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave ecosystem. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "![IMG_4368](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkHeXxqNkg.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nTokenLogic proposes to renew our engagement with the Aave DAO  for 1 year from the 15th December 2024 when our current stream ends.\n\nTokenLogic is to provide the following services to the DAO. \n\n- Treasury and Runway Management;\n- Analytics and Performance Metrics;\n- GHO's growth across DeFi and CeFi; and,\n- Support Aave protocol parameter optimisation.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## What to Expect\n\n### Treasury and Runway Management\n\n**Asset Management & Financial Security**\n\nA central area of focus for the Finance Services Provider is to ensure that the DAO’s expenses and strategic initiatives are funded efficiently and without delay. Through the Steward role, or the standard governance process when required, TokenLogic will prioritize maintaining the DAO’s financial stability by ensuring a runway that exceeds six months of its burn rate while optimizing capital efficiency.\n\nKey components of this objective include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds across networks;\n* Providing AAVE & GHO Protocol-Owned-Liquidity (POL);\n* Allocating assets for capital efficiency, integrating yield bearing assets to the treasury;\n* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3, and between Aave v3 markets;\n* Swapping assets to align expenses with holdings.\n\n### Analytics and Performance metrics\n\nTokenLogic is establishing itself as the definitive hub for all Aave Protocol and GHO-related data via the [Aave Portal](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/). This initiative will be continuously developed and expanded throughout the year, providing access to key metrics on protocol performance, health, GHO dynamics, and market analysis.\n\nTransparency, analytics, and reporting are at the core of this effort, ensuring a clear understanding of the protocol’s financial status and overall performance. The Aave Portal will serve as an important tool for informed decision-making and in-depth analysis of the Aave ecosystem.\n\nTo further engage and educate the community, this initiative will be complemented by detailed threads/articles released throughout the mandate, promoting awareness and understanding of the platform’s developments.\n\n### GHO Adoption\n\n**Oversight**\n\nThe year 2025 will mark the second year of GHO, solidifying its strength and utility within the ecosystem. This milestone year is set to be a pivotal period of expansion for GHO, as it continues to expand to other networks and remains a cornerstone of the protocol’s revenue model.\n\nAs GHO Stewards, TokenLogic will oversee critical configurations, including the Borrow Rate, GSM Caps and Fees, ensuring optimal functionality and sustainability. In our role as Treasury Managers, we will strategically manage GHO swaps to maintain a robust and stable peg, reinforcing GHO’s position as a key asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nWe will continue to spearhead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), with a primary focus on managing liquidity, introducing POL from the Treasury, coordination GHO's launch on other networks (excl. Gnosis) and driving integrations across diverse protocols.\n\nOur key responsibilities include:\n\n- Strategically adjusting liquidity incentives to ensure robust market depth;\n- Designing and implementing direct liquidity incentive programs;\n- Leading initiatives to enhance GHO’s utility and adoption;\n- Optimizing the deployment of the DAO’s strategic voting assets;\n- Supporting future GHO facilitator programs;\n- Deploying aToken GSMs;\n- Deploying GHO liquidity from the Treasury;\n- Facilitating GHO integration into centralized exchanges, fund management platforms, and the broader DeFi ecosystem; and,\n- Support teams seeking to attain a line of credit within the upcoming Emergence instance.\n\n**Parameter Configuration**\n\nTokenLogic will continue to provide detailed insights into GHO's performance and provide parameter recommendations that prioritise price stability whilst balancing the DAO's growth ambitions. \n\nStrategic focus will be placed on managing the borrow rate and peg relationship to maintain the resilience of the peg by retaining funds within the GSMs, whilst promoting the ongoing use of GHO within evolving market dynamics.\n\nThe Aave Portal will provide insights into the impact of the parameter adjustments to curate an environment that promotes sustainable growth, adoption and aligns with Aave's broader financial goals. \n\nThe TokenLogic team will collaborate closely with other service providers to create balanced, effective solutions that benefit the protocol as a whole.\n\n### Aave Protocol\n\nThe evolution of the Aave protocol, including updates to Aave v4, the deployment of Umbrella, and the launch of new Aave markets, will bring transformative changes to the protocol’s operations. Our proposal focuses on providing the financial planning and management essential for navigating these developments and ensuring smooth integration within the broader ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, we will support the adaptation of Aave’s tokenomics to meet the requirements of Umbrella and the introduction of new staking pools. Through proactive collaboration, strategic guidance, and consultation, we are committed to ensuring these updates are implemented seamlessly and positioned for long-term success.\n\n# Terms\n\n* 12-month engagement, December 15th 2024 to December 15th 2025; and,\n* 1,000,000 GHO streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n\n# Specification\n\nTo support funding the streams, the following is to be performed:\n\n* 0.75M GHO deposited Prime instance;\n* 0.75M aEthUSDC swapped to GHO; and,\n* GHO from swap sent to Treasury.\n\nCreate the following stream allowing TokenLogic to withdraw GHO from the Prime instance.\n\nStream: 1,000,000 GHO over 365 days\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nThe stream shall commence the next block from when the previous stream finishes.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond the Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic does provide data analytics services to Gearbox. This commitment does not interfere with our responsibilities to the Aave DAO. \n\nWe conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-02-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince its initial [funding in October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/), the Aave Liquidity Committee (previously GLC) has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools.\n \nAs a result of these efforts:\n\n* Deeper on-chain liquidity\n* Lower slippage, especially for GHO to USDC swaps\n\nIn combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC's initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery.\n\nThroughout the period, the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and, more frequently, Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility. A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).\n\nWhile some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.\n\nConcentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. \n\nThe following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:\n\n* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume \n    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period\n    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility \n*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP\n    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced\n* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks\n    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiex2m345ibzurmui7f3vz7l5w23sv53ej6fj5tppcqcphfsf3p2l4)\nSource: [karpatkey - Dune Analytics - ](https://dune.com/karpatkey/gho-debt-and-token-metrics)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreib2sefybdb73e7g4wksg7mk5wlj3ul53plmw3hrpbmpltn3wlxzu4)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-pools)\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiabucrlngizdmx25lzi23uorxsgkzoxm6da7tksdmhnw7cbpqqvue)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-committee)\n\nThe next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:\n\n* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD \n* Reducing price volatility\n* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations\n* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools\n* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases\n\nThese efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). \n\nThough there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:\n\n| Objective | Category | Budget   |\n| --------  | --------  | -------- |\n| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |\n| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |\n|Total| | 500k GHO|\n\nIt is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Performance Indicators\n\nThe below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:\n\n| Description| Optimal Value|\n| --------  | --------  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |\n| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\nThe [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. \n\nEach of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.\n\n# Specification\n\nSwap the following assets for GHO:\n\n* 250k aUSDT\n* 250k aUSDC\n\nCreate an allowance for 500k GHO.\n\nALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n1. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
