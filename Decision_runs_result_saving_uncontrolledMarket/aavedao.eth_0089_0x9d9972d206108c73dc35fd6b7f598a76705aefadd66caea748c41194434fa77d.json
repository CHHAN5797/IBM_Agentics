        "body": "Author: HyperLend Team ([0xNessus](https://x.com/0xNessus) and [fbsloXBT](https://x.com/fbsloXBT))\nDate:  2025-02-07\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to recognize [HyperLend](https://www.hyperlend.finance/) as a friendly fork of Aave, deployed on the Hyperliquid EVM chain (HyperEVM).\n\nHyperLend aims to support Aave’s ecosystem by sharing 10% of its protocol revenue with the Aave DAO and allocating 3.5% of its token supply to the DAO treasury. Additionally, 1% of the total supply will be airdropped to stAAVE holders, ensuring alignment with Aave’s community and stakeholders.\n\n### Motivation\n\n\n##### About HyperLend:\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish HyperLend as a friendly fork of Aave, deploying multi-asset pools on HyperEVM to become the leading money market on the network. \n\nBeyond core multi-asset lending pools, we will have isolated pools to support riskier assets, and we are working with vault curators to create optimized yield strategies on top of our markets. Additionally, HyperLend will tokenize the HLP vault and perpetual positions, which will be available as collateral in the isolated pools.\n\nThis will position HyperLend as the leading lending protocol on HyperEVM, driving liquidity and composability within the ecosystem.\nWe are currently deployed on [HyperEVM testnet](https://testnet.hyperlend.finance/) (using MIT-licensed v3.0.2 codebase), with over 200k total users (10-20k daily, excluding known sybils).\n\nWe are working with [Block Analitica](https://x.com/BlockAnalitica) as our risk manager, had additional audits done by [Ackee](https://ackee.xyz/), [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/competitions/cd180bb3-5d7d-46ed-8b99-d905e54a9d0b), and [Pashov](https://www.pashov.net/), and have partnered with [Resolv](https://x.com/ResolvLabs), [Swell](https://x.com/swellnetworkio), [ThunderHead](https://x.com/ThunderheadLabs), [Stargate](https://x.com/StargateFinance), [RedStone](https://x.com/redstone_defi), [Pyth](https://x.com/PythNetwork), [Theo](https://x.com/TheoNetwork_) and more.\n\n**By formally recognizing HyperLend as a friendly fork, Aave DAO can establish a mutually beneficial relationship with us, capturing additional value for the DAO and AAVE token holders, while allowing HyperLend to use its secure & battle-tested codebase.**\n\n### Specification\n\nWe propose that HyperLend:\n- share 10% of the revenue (derived from the Aave codebase*) with the Aave DAO (either distributed monthly or by using `RevenueSplitter` contract) \n- distribute 3.5% of the HyperLend (HPL) token supply to the Aave DAO (at TGE)\n- distribute 1% of the HPL token supply to stkAAVE holders (at TGE)\n\n<small>*revenue from isolated pools, P2P, and non-lending aspects of the protocol (such as potential tHLP fees) is excluded</small>\n\nIn return, Aave DAO should:\n- grant HyperLend the license to use the Aave codebase\n- notify HyperLend of any potential security issues found in the Aave codebase, so we can mitigate them before they are publicly disclosed\n\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Receive the feedback from the Aave community\n- Escalate this proposal to a Temp Check Snapshot\n- If Temp Check snapshot passes: \n    - publish an ARFC forum post\n    - escalate the proposal to an ARFC snapshot\n\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard osGNO to Aave v3 Gnosis\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-29\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to Onboard osGNO, the Liquid Staking Token (LST) of StakeWise V3 into the GnosisMarket. By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nGNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain. \n\nosGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.\n\nCreating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.  \n\nosGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism). If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.\n\nosETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nPotential POL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nosGNO announcement post: https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\n\nosGNO Vaults: https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeWise and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and some ACI team members are holders of GNO.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks. Aave stands to gain significantly as a primary partner in this expansion, following the successful playbook of cbBTC, which quickly scaled through similar collaborative efforts.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: 0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364\n\nChainlink oracle: upcoming\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: Bitcoin Reserve Address | FBTC\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: FBTC proof of assets dashboard\n\nGitHub: GitHub - fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: fbtc-contract/audits at main · fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract · GitHub\n\nTwitter: x.com\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\nDisclosure\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublish a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

    "summary": "The proposal seeks to formally recognize HyperLend as a friendly fork of Aave, enabling a mutually beneficial relationship through revenue sharing, token allocations, and licensing agreements. Timeline metrics show unanimous and stable early support for YAE. Forum discussion is limited but slightly negative, mainly due to concerns about the proposal's implications. Historical similar proposals focused on onboarding or renewing programs have passed with strong YAE support but saw subsequent declines in token price and TVL, highlighting potential risks. Market impacts for this proposal show a minor negative price impact but positive TVL growth.",

      "HyperLend sharing 10% of protocol revenue with Aave DAO adds ongoing value.",
      "3.5% token allocation to DAO treasury and 1% to stAAVE holders align incentives.",
      "Licensing the Aave codebase to HyperLend supports ecosystem growth and composability.",
