        "body": "# Abstract\n\nIn November 2024, following discussions on [shielded voting](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-default-to-using-shielded-voting-for-snapshot-votes/25884) and [conflicts of interest](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-create-coi-self-voting-policies/26062) policy, the DAO [adopted](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2e701a942a8ed6f9ec8302cea866ab08648eeef0d07170814e3a3c3eb4e48415) a 6.5-month trial of a Code of Conduct and procedural updates. After taking in community feedback, observing outcomes, and discussions with the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy is proposing the following changes and a 2nd trial period through the end of January 2026:\n\n* Revisions to the Code of Conduct with an additional extension.\n* Changes to the DAO’s Procedures:\n  * **Removal of the Responsible Voting Policy:** Remove the Responsible Voting Policy due to the presence of vote-buying services, which make it impossible to enforce appropriately.\n  * **Member Replacement Process:** Dedicated language that outlines a process for replacing a DAO-elected committee/council member who voluntarily steps away from their responsibilities, if a process is not already pre-defined in the original proposal.\n  * **Cancellation of Ongoing Initiative Process:** Dedicated language that outlines the process to wind down/cancel an initiative if a process is not already defined in the relevant proposal. A Snapshot vote with quorum defined as the number of votes FOR meeting 3% of the votable supply. If there are more voting options than the basic FOR/AGAINST/ABSTAIN, the option with the largest number of votes will be applied, given that the options to modify/cancel an initiative together reach over the active non-constitutional quorum.\n\nWith the initial trial period now concluded, Entropy is seeking to reignite the Code of Conduct & DAO Procedures conversation and welcomes further input from the community.\n\n# Terms\n\n**Contributor:** An individual or entity who willingly engages in Arbitrum governance and/or is compensated via a DAO-approved program.\n\n**DAO-approved program:** A structured initiative that is funded and/or authorized by the Arbitrum DAO through a formal governance vote (Tally or Snapshot) and designed to achieve defined objectives. Examples include the Arbitrum Audit Program, the Arbitrum D.A.O. Grant Program, and other comparable initiatives that receive DAO treasury funding or delegated authority.\n\n**Community Guidelines:** The rules of engagement for the Arbitrum DAO forum as [outlined](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807) and enforced by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n**Conflict of Interest (COI):** A situation where a contributor, or any entity with which a contributor has a direct professional or financial relationship, stands to directly benefit from the outcome of a proposal or election.\n\n**Responsible Voting:** The practice of an election candidate casting votes for oneself and other candidates in a neutral manner to fill all open positions.\n\n**Shielded Voting:** On Snapshot, votes are kept private during the voting process, but made public after the conclusion of the vote.\n\n# Motivation/Rationale\n\nThe Code of Conduct and Procedural Updates were introduced in late 2024 as a trial to establish clear expectations around delegate and contributor behavior and formalize certain aspects of how the DAO operated. At the time, Entropy envisioned that the Code of Conduct could be added to the Arbitrum Constitution to serve as a cultural anchor. However, after further deliberation with the Arbitrum Foundation, our team is in agreement that codifying the Code of Conduct at this stage is premature.\n\nConstitutional amendments are purposefully a high-stakes process that requires strong consensus from delegates and contributors, and thus, we feel it is unwise to push the Code of Conduct forward until it is in a near-final state.\n\nIf the refined Code of Conduct proves effective through continued use, it can be revisited for constitutional inclusion in the future following the conclusion of the 2nd trial period in January 2026. As a reminder, Entropy also proposed adding the DAO’s [Mission, Vision, and Purpose](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-s-mission-vision-purpose-mvp/27275) to the Constitution. When it comes time to make the amendment, we think it is best to combine all proposed changes into a single constitutional proposal.\n\nLastly, the language from the first proposal implied that both the Code of Conduct and Procedural Updates would be included in the Arbitrum Constitution. After consideration, Entropy now firmly believes procedural policies such as voting schedules or shielded elections should remain outside the Constitution as a social contract given the DAO’s constantly evolving nature, thus reserving the document for high-level principles that guide the DAO. Instead, these procedures can be revisited once a year in January following the Holiday Break and changed with a Snapshot vote if needed, with the quorum set at the active non-constitutional quorum level.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Revisions to the Code of Conduct\n\nIn November 2024, the Arbitrum DAO approved the trial of a Code of Conduct via [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.box/#/s:arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2e701a942a8ed6f9ec8302cea866ab08648eeef0d07170814e3a3c3eb4e48415), establishing shared expectations around civility, integrity, transparency, and responsible participation. That code has since served as a behavioral baseline during the initial governance trial.\n\nThe revised Code of Conduct and DAO Procedures will be in effect following its ratification with a Snapshot vote through January 31st, 2026. At the conclusion of this 2nd trial, the DAO can revisit its procedures and discuss if it is time to formalize the Code of Conduct into the Arbitrum Constitution on an annual basis. To ensure that the DAO has ample time to discuss such matters without the Code of Conduct and DAO Procedures losing its validity, the Arbitrum Foundation reserves the right to extend their effectiveness by up to two months through March 31st, 2026 as long as a new version has not yet been officially ratified.\n\nWhen it comes time to add the Code of Conduct to the Arbitrum Constitution, we envision it as a new Section 7, following the existing Section 6: Community Values. In order to keep the included language sufficiently high level, the following quoted block contains the 5 sub-sections to be included:\n\n---\n\n> ### 7.1 Values Alignment\n> \n> Arbitrum contributors should always strive to uphold the seven community values stated above in Section 6:\n> \n> * **Ethereum-aligned:** Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and community\n> * **Sustainable:** Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gains\n> * **Secure:** Arbitrum is security minded\n> * **Socially inclusive:** Open and welcoming to all constructive participants\n> * **Technically inclusive:** Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technology\n> * **User-focused:** Managed for the benefit of all users\n> * **Neutral and open:** Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition\n> \n> ### 7.2 Good Faith and Best Interest\n> \n> * Contributors should conduct themselves with honesty, integrity, and transparency, fostering trust and confidence among community members.\n> * Contributors should act and vote in accordance with what they see is in the best interests of Arbitrum, which encompasses but is not limited to all of the following: Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, the Orbit Ecosystem, and any future Arbitrum DAO-governed chains as outlined above in Section 1.\n> \n> ### 7.3 Due Care and Attention\n> \n> * Contributors should remain knowledgeable of developments in regard to Arbitrum DAO’s initiatives and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem.\n> * Contributors should strive to make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal before submitting their vote.\n> * Contributors are advised to vote abstain when unable to conduct the necessary diligence to understand the proposals.\n> \n> ### 7.4 Civility and Professionalism\n> \n> * While separate from the Code of Conduct, contributors are expected to uphold the [community guidelines](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807) for activity on the Arbitrum DAO forum and de facto understood gathering places for the Arbitrum DAO, whether online or in-person.\n> * Contributors should seek to create a respectful and inclusive environment for all community members, free from harassment and discrimination.\n>   * Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:\n>     * Publicly or privately harassing or intimidating others\n>     * Sharing someone's private information without their consent\n>     * Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwanted advances\n>     * Making insulting or derogatory comments about others\n> * Contributors should strive to provide constructive feedback that is well-researched and respectful, focusing on the proposal's merits. Personal attacks are never acceptable.\n> * Contributors should be open-minded and respectful of differing viewpoints, even if they disagree with them. Disagreements are an inevitable part of healthy debate, but they often yield positive results when approached in a civil manner.\n> * Contributors should make a best effort to provide constructive feedback through appropriate channels and avoid taking discussions to social media in a manner that could tarnish Arbitrum DAO’s brand and reputation.\n> * Contributors should avoid making unsubstantiated accusations that imply malice without proper evidence. They should conduct proper due diligence before making any public accusations via social media, public forums, or any other recognized communication channels. This includes exhausting all available avenues, such as seeking clarification privately, before issuing any public statement that contains an unsubstantiated accusation about another DAO contributor.\n> \n> ### 7.5 Responsibility\n> \n> * Maintaining a culture of productive debate, integrity, and transparency requires a sense of collective responsibility. As entrusted leaders of the Arbitrum community, contributors should take responsibility in fostering and maintaining a culture that promotes the principles outlined herein.\n> * Best practices of responsible contributors:\n>   * **Participation:** Contributors should make an effort to vote (even if they vote abstain) on all proposals.\n>   * **Communication:** Contributors should clearly communicate their rationale behind votes and discussions to the Arbitrum community.\n>   * **Accountability:** Contributors should maintain knowledge of all DAO initiatives and hold managing parties or elected representatives accountable.\n>   * **Responsiveness:** Contributors should use their best efforts to connect with the Arbitrum community and be accessible to answer questions or concerns.\n\n---\n\nFrom the previous iteration, the following language changes have been made to the Code of Conduct:\n\n1. In the previous iteration, participants were referred to as “delegates”. This term has been updated to “contributor”.\n2. Mention of the ARB token in section 7.2 has been removed.\n3. Language involving unsubstantiated accusations has been added to section 7.4: “Contributors should avoid making unsubstantiated accusations that imply malice without proper evidence. They should conduct proper due diligence before making any public accusations via social media, public forums, or any other recognized communication channels. This includes exhausting all available avenues, such as seeking clarification privately, before issuing any public statement that contains an unsubstantiated accusation about another DAO contributor.“\n4. Examples of contributor resources have been removed from section 7.3. Given that these might change in the future, we determined it was too detailed for the Constitution.\n5. “but not limited to” has been added in section 7.4 before the example list of unacceptable behavior.\n6. “they vote” has been added to “(even if they vote abstain)” in the Participation definition of section 7.5.\n\nSections 7.1 through 7.5 outline enduring values and expectations appropriate for constitutional inclusion, while the clauses regarding Conflicts of Interest, Enforcement, and Conflict Resolution are more operational in nature. We envision that Conflicts of Interest disclosure policies, as well as enforcement and conflict resolution mechanisms may need to adapt over time based on active programs, contributor behavior, and evolving community standards. Embedding these specifics into the Constitution would limit the DAO’s flexibility to make changes if necessary. Instead, both Entropy and the Arbitrum Foundation agree that it is more appropriate for these sections to live outside the Constitution in a similar manner to the agreed-upon Procedural Updates.\n\nIn the following sections, mentions of the Delegate Incentive Program (DIP) have been generalized so that the terminology encompasses compensation from any DAO program that incentivizes voting or participation activity. Overall, the main changes have been made to the Enforcement & Appeal Process section. As the DAO’s structure is currently rapidly evolving, we foresee that most paid executors will either be directly hired by the DAO as AAEs, working as service providers or contractors under an AAE, or elected into a council overseeing an AAE, with each structure having bespoke checks and balances in place to ensure that executors are behaving professionally and ethically.\n\n### Conflicts of Interest\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a conflict of interest exists, it is expected that the contributor discloses the nature and extent of the conflict in writing on the forum before voting. Proposal authors should disclose potential conflicts in the COI section of the recommended proposal template as outlined in the [“How to Submit a DAO Proposal”](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/how-to-submit-a-dao-proposal/13494) by the Arbitrum Foundation. While it may not always be clear if an individual/entity stands to gain “directly” or “indirectly”, contributors and proposal authors are recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency.\n\nContributors who disclose a conflict of interest are not expected to alter their voting in any way. Self-voting is not currently banned outright for the reasons stated in previous DAO-wide [discussions](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-create-coi-self-voting-policies/26062) and based on sentiment gathered from a subsequent [temperature check](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xbbec2fbf891d9abb21e8be380f79806519df8294d1d2cdce155d105fd1fed8db). However, a contributor who repeatedly fails to disclose a conflict of interest before voting risks being removed from their compensated governance role.\n\n### Enforcement & Appeal Process\n\nAll contributors are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct. Enforcement will take place through any program that financially compensates performing governance activities, such as rewards for voting/forum activity, or participation in DAO-approved programs where contributors are directly elected to facilitate the programs.\n\nThe program manager, council, or comparable facilitator in charge of the program is the one responsible for determining violations of the Code of Conduct and reserves the right to take what it deems as appropriate action, which may include but is not limited to, issuing a warning, suspension, or removal from the program. Any community member can raise a concern to the party responsible for managing the program with respect to a contributor failing to uphold the Code of Conduct. While the responsible party is required to acknowledge receipt of the concern and investigate the matter, the final determination and resulting course of action, which may include dismissing the concern, will depend on the underlying program’s structure.\n\nIf there are contradictions between the Code of Conduct and the specific program that is compensating a contributor, then the policies of the program shall take precedence. It is assumed that a program will define its own appeal process, but if it does not, then the conflict resolution section (next) will be the default appeal approach.\n\n### Conflict Resolution\n\nResolution of conflicts between contributors (and between contributors and programs) will be entrusted to the Arbitrum Foundation, which will act as a neutral mediator. It is recommended that contributors first seek to resolve conflict issues in good faith and privately. If the matter is unable to be resolved for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, the matter can be raised to the Arbitrum Foundation using this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHN5FLtcxWvB6oj3kqWcfAuxj0xuKlLI9A_ZU3G4tIZvDLLA/viewform). The Arbitrum Foundation will have the final say on the issue and reserves the right to determine if the issue should be brought to the attention of the community as a whole.\n\nIn the future and once OpCo is fully operational, responsibility for the resolution of conflicts can be transferred to the OpCo at the Arbitrum Foundation’s discretion. The Arbitrum Foundation will acknowledge when this transfer can take place and make it public on the governance forum when it goes into effect.\n\n## Changes to the DAO’s Procedures\n\nEntropy proposes an extended pilot of the DAO's procedures through the end of January 2026 to evaluate three adjustments/additions: Removing the Responsible Voting policy due to the presence of vote-buying services and, if not defined in the original proposal, processes for both the replacement of a DAO-elected committee/council member that voluntarily steps down and the termination of an ongoing DAO initiative.\n\nRemaining unchanged from the previous iteration are the predictable voting schedule, the use of shielded voting for elections, and the inclusion of a Holiday Break at the end of the year. These changes reflect areas of feedback and allow the DAO to generate data across another trial period before making final decisions.\n\n### 1. Removing the Responsible Voting Policy\n\nEntropy recognizes that the complexity of the original policy created confusion for some participating candidates, especially in situations where there was only a single seat being filled through the election. Additionally, since the introduction of the policy, vote-buying services have become more common, and notably, LobbyFi has received substantial delegation. After observing the impact on the OAT election in particular, Entropy has concluded that enforcing the Responsible Voting Policy is no longer feasible. Participating candidates can effectively bypass the policy by sending funds to a fresh address to purchase or bid for additional votes, thus circumventing the original policy’s intentions and putting other candidates strictly following the policy at a disadvantage.\n\nTherefore, Entropy is proposing to sunset the Responsible Voting Policy and return to the DAO’s original standards of allowing participating candidates to self-vote with their full voting power. Staying consistent with the Disclosure and Transparency Policy, candidates who plan to self-vote should still disclose the action to the DAO. Remaining unchanged from the previous trial, contributors not participating in the election are free to vote however they wish, but if a conflict of interest exists, it should be disclosed on the forums before voting.\n\n### 2. DAO-Elected Member Replacement Process\n\nDue to the recent instances of elected members stepping away from positions, it became apparent that not having a pre-defined process for replacing DAO-elected committee members can lead to possible friction and uncertainty. In these instances, several paths were proposed by contributors, including a new DAO-wide election, taking the runner-up individual, the proposal author nominating a new member, or consolidating/elevating the responsibilities of an existing member.\n\nTo prevent the aforementioned uncertainty from arising in the future, Entropy is proposing the following process for the replacement of elected members who step down from a program when no process has been defined in the primary proposal passed to initiate an initiative:\n\n* If the initiative has an acting program manager or dedicated committee/council that manages the initiative, it is their responsibility to consult with all other involved parties to identify a suitable replacement or best path forward (including but not limited to possibly consolidating responsibilities across roles, renegotiating payment terms to reflect new duties, or not replacing a member due to the initiative coming to an end).\n* If the initiative has no program manager or dedicated committee/council, the responsibility falls to the author of the proposal. In this event, they are entrusted with the same flexibility as the program manager and can decide the best course of action.\n* If neither of these parties is suited to make the decision on member replacement, for the moment, the Arbitrum Foundation will be the determining party. Once ready, OpCo can assume this responsibility. Depending on the situation, the Arbitrum Foundation/OpCo may turn over the decision to the DAO and call for an election.\n\nWhichever party ultimately makes the decision on the best course of action, they are expected to provide a short update with rationale and basic information for the DAO.\n\nFor the purposes of clarity, we are proposing the above process only for positions that are filled by a DAO-wide election, and no dedicated process to replace a member has been defined in the original proposal. If an initiative has a program manager/council-appointed position that needs replacement or filling, due to either an individual stepping down or underperforming, it will be left up to the discretion of the initiative owner/manager.\n\n### 3. Voting Requirement for the Cancellation of Ongoing Initiatives\n\nRecently, several contributors have raised the question of whether a proposal to clawback funds or terminate an active DAO program should require a Snapshot with a certain quorum threshold (unconstitutional or constitutional) or an onchain vote. If not defined in the original proposal, we propose the following wind-down requirements as the default.\n\nA Snapshot vote where the number of FOR votes to wind down the initiative meets 3% of the votable supply. If there are more voting options than the basic FOR/AGAINST/ABSTAIN, the option with the largest number of votes will be applied, given that the options to modify/cancel an initiative together exceed the 3% of votable supply level. For the purpose of clarity, if a proposal only seeks to modify an existing initiative, this voting requirement will not apply.\n\nThe individual/entity that brings forward the proposal to cancel an ongoing initiative is expected to provide sufficient information and rationale to help inform the DAO of their intentions. Any individual/entity with the adequate 500k ARB of voting power to post a vote on Snapshot may move the proposal forward.\n\nWe believe that such a structure elevates the requirements for canceling an initiative in a manner that provides comparable legitimacy to an actual onchain vote.\n\n### 4. Extend the use of Shielded Elections\n\nEntropy has conducted an analysis of shielded voting, seeking to understand if participation rates or voting behavior changed. We have created a [dashboard](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/shielded-voting-analysis) that contributors can reference. It is important to note that several factors can impact the voting behavior of an election, including the number of seats, candidates, and its importance. We felt that the ARDC elections were the most appropriate instance to directly compare non-shielded and shielded elections. The following summarizes our findings:\n\n* **Stable engagement by large stakeholders:** Average participation by large voters (100k+ voting power) held nearly constant. 41 in public elections vs. 44 in shielded elections.\n* **Overall turnout decline reflects ecosystem-wide trends:** Unique voter count fell (28,164 to 3,520), but this mirrors the DAO-wide drop in unique voter engagement. We did not notice a major difference in the participation of shielded elections vs other recent proposals.\n* **11th-Hour Voting Slightly Increased:** Compared to public elections, late voting increased, with the share of votes cast in the final 24 hours rising in shielded elections. On average, 50.53% of the total VP was cast in the final 24 hours of a shielded election, up from an average of 41.59% in public elections. As mentioned above, Entropy is not confident that this is solely attributable to shielded voting, and could be partially due to the more predictable voting schedule with elections now being posted only on Thursdays.\n* **ARDC Case Study – V1 (Public) vs V2 (Shielded):** Early voting (days 1–3) dropped from ~30% to ~10% under shielded conditions, while day-7 activity surged. Nearly 60% of the total VP in V2 was cast on the final day.\n\nOverall, Entropy believes an extension of shielded voting will let us validate and examine the effects of shielded voting further. In **Part 3** of the dashboard, contributors are welcome to pick an Arbitrum DAO election to explore its activity.\n\nAs was the case during the 1st trial, shielded elections will only apply to those conducted on Snapshot and will not apply to the Security Council elections held on Tally.\n\n### 5. DAO Holiday Break: December 18th, 2025 - January 5th, 2026\n\nSimilar to last year, the purpose of a Holiday Break is to ensure that voters have a break and can return refreshed for the new year.\n\nProposal authors should be cognizant of timelines and aim to have all voting wrapped up by Thursday, December 18th if possible. To ensure this, temperature checks would have to start no later than Thursday, December 11th, 2025, and onchain votes scheduled by Monday, December 1st, 2025.\n\nDiffering from last year’s holiday break, we believe it is acceptable for new proposals to be posted to the forum, but the DAO should aim to only put emergency proposals to vote during the period.\n\nEntropy recognizes that several proposals were delayed due to last year’s holiday break, so it is our recommendation that a certain level of flexibility be accepted by contributors in the event some voting is not wrapped up exactly by December 18th. The primary motivation of such a timeline is to ensure no voting occurs during the especially busy holiday period of December 24th - January 1st.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* July 9th: Forum post\n* July 15th at 2 pm UTC: Open Discussion - Google Meets [Link](https://meet.google.com/zsn-yzjm-chx)\n* July 17th: Snapshot Vote\n* July 24th, 2025 - January 31st, 2026: 2nd Trial Period",

        "body": "This description has been heavily shortened due to character limits. Please refer to the forums for the full proposal. https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrum-dao-delegate-code-of-conduct-formalizing-the-daos-operations/27188\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces a delegate code of conduct for Arbitrum DAO alongside additional improvements to the DAO’s operational standards.\n\nIf approved, the Code of Conduct and operational updates will take effect on Monday, November 11th, followed by a ~6.5-month trial period ending on May 30th before being considered for permanent inclusion in the Arbitrum Constitution.\n\n## Motivation/Rationale\n\nAs the Arbitrum DAO continues to grow and evolve, a standardized code of conduct for delegates becomes increasingly necessary to create a culture that attracts high quality contributors. As the leading scaling solution across most notable metrics and one of the most active governance ecosystems, it is also important for the Arbitrum DAO to lead the industry in terms of professionalism and transparency.\n\nEstablishing clear and strict rules of conduct can be challenging and even counterproductive; therefore, the primary goal of the Delegate Code of Conduct is to help the Arbitrum DAO foster a culture of transparency, integrity, and civility. The Code of Conduct is a set of written principles that Arbitrum Delegates should embody. Delegates should use their best discretion and act in a way that aligns with the Code's spirit, rather than seeking to exploit loopholes or ambiguities.\n\n## The Arbitrum DAO Delegate Code of Conduct\n\n### Values Alignment\n\nArbitrum Delegates should always strive to uphold the seven community values stated in the Arbitrum Constitution. \n\n* **Ethereum-aligned:** Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and community\n* **Sustainable:** Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gains\n* **Secure:** Arbitrum is security minded\n* **Socially inclusive:** Open and welcoming to all constructive participants\n* **Technically inclusive:** Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technology\n* **User-focused:** Managed for the benefit of all users\n* **Neutral and open:** Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition\n\n### Good Faith and Best Interest\n\n* Delegates should conduct themselves with honesty, integrity, and transparency, fostering trust and confidence among community members.\n* Delegates should act and vote in accordance with what they see is in the best interests of Arbitrum, which encompasses but is not limited to all of the following: Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, the Orbit Ecosystem, the ARB token, and any future Arbitrum DAO-governed chains as outlined in the Arbitrum Constitution. \n\n### Due Care and Attention\n\n* Delegates should remain knowledgeable of developments in regards to Arbitrum DAO’s initiatives and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. \n* Delegates should make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal before submitting their vote.\n* Delegates are advised to vote abstain when unable to conduct the necessary diligence to understand the proposals.\n\n### Civility and Professionalism\n\n* While separate from the Code of Conduct, delegates are expected to uphold the community guidelines for activity on the Arbitrum DAO forum and de-facto understood gathering places for the Arbitrum DAO, whether online or in-person.\n* Delegates should seek to create a respectful and inclusive environment for all community members, free from harassment and discrimination.\n  * Examples of unacceptable behavior include:\n    * Publicly or privately harassing or intimidating others\n    * Sharing someone's private information without their consent\n    * Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwanted advances\n    * Making insulting or derogatory comments about others\n * Delegates should strive to provide constructive feedback that is well-researched and respectful, focusing on the proposal's merits. Personal attacks are never acceptable.\n* Delegates should be open-minded and respectful of differing viewpoints, even if they disagree with them. Disagreements are an inevitable part of healthy debate, but they often yield positive results when approached in a civil manner.\n* Delegates should make a best effort to provide constructive feedback through appropriate channels and avoid taking discussions to social media in a manner that could tarnish Arbitrum DAO’s brand and reputation.\n\n### Responsibility\n\n* Maintaining a culture of productive debate, integrity, and transparency requires a sense of collective responsibility. As entrusted leaders of the Arbitrum community, delegates should take responsibility in fostering and maintaining a culture that promotes the principles outlined herein.\n* Best practices of responsible delegates:\n  * **Participation:** delegates should make an effort to vote (even if abstain) on all proposals.\n  * **Communication:** delegates should clearly communicate their rationale behind votes and discussions to the Arbitrum community.\n  * **Accountability:** delegates should maintain knowledge of funded initiatives and hold managing parties or elected representatives accountable.\n  * **Responsiveness:** delegates should use their best efforts to connect with the Arbitrum community and be accessible to answer questions or concerns.\n\n### Conflicts of Interest\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a conflict of interest exists, it is expected the delegate discloses the nature and extent of the conflict in writing on the forum before voting. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain “directly” or “indirectly”, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency.\n\nDelegates that disclose a conflict of interest are not expected to alter their voting in any way. However, as explained further below, a delegate that repeatedly fails to disclose a conflict of interest before self-voting or if a single instance is deemed to be severe, they risk being removed from the Delegate Incentive Program or a DAO-elected position.\n\n### Conflict Resolution and Enforcement\n\nThe Code of Conduct has been purposefully written in a manner to establish a set principles that Arbitrum Delegates should embody rather than a complete set of enforceable rules.\n\n**Conflict Resolution between Delegates**\n\nIn general, it is our belief that many conflict issues can be resolved quickly and easily if approached in good faith by each party. Delegates and community members are encouraged to first address the behavior directly in private. If the matter is unable to be resolved for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it to the Arbitrum Foundation using this form.\n\n**Soft-Enforcement of the Delegate Code of Conduct**\n\nWhile it is not feasible to hold every governance participant accountable for upholding these principles, the DAO can hold accountable delegates compensated or individuals it elects to positions of power. \n\n**Delegate Incentive Program Removal**\n\nAs stated in the Delegate Incentive Program proposal, the program administrator reserves the right to issue a suspension or permanent ban if a delegate does not meet the eligibility requirements, which includes upholding the Code of Conduct. \n\n**DAO-Elected Position Removal**\n\nAny DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove a DAO-elected representative. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. \n\n## Standardizing the DAO’s Operations\n\n### Voting Schedule\n\nAs ratified in a Snapshot vote to improve predictability in the Arbitrum DAO’s operations, delegates agree to abide by the vote scheduling guidelines. \n\n### Election Standards\n\nThe Responsible Voting policy is an effort to strike a balance between preventing delegates from unfavorably electing themselves into a position of power and compensation while allowing them to still effectively represent their communities and tokenholders. In a normal election with multiple seats, the policy is simple: candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill all the remaining positions. With token and weighted voting, there are additional nuances and guidelines must be set in place to address edge scenarios.\n\n**Shielded Elections with Weighted Voting:** A few weeks ago the Entropy team posted a temperature check to gauge the DAO’s stance on shielded voting. The results indicated that a slight majority of delegates favored the use of shielded voting as the default for elections. In order to align with Security Council elections, weighted voting as opposed to approval voting will be the official default voting type.\n\n**Minimum Application Period:** In order to draw a sufficient number of high quality applicants, application periods should be a minimum of 14 days.\n\nWhere n = number of seats; proposal authors should seek to have at least n+3 applicants before starting the election. Since this may not always be possible, it is simply a recommendation and not a requirement.\n\n### Delegating to the Arbitrum Exclude Address\n\nARB tokens allocated to DAO initiatives are not to be used in governance. To keep circulating voting supply from increasing, whenever possible, multi-sigs holding program funds should delegate to the Arbitrum Exclude Address. This will prevent tokens from being included in quorum calculations. \n\n## Timeline\n\nBefore codifying the Arbitrum Code of Conduct and updates to the DAO’s operations into the Arbitrum Constitution, we believe it is best to trial the changes for a period of 6 months post ratification of this proposal. At which point, any necessary changes or delegate feedback can be incorporated. Depending on sentiment and the changes made, the trial period can be extended another 6 months or a constitutional proposal can be put forth to update the language of the Constitution.",

        "body": "# Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the ideas and concepts introduced by [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) in the initial [Operation Company (OpCo) proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737). The OpCo is a legal entity that delegates and key stakeholders can leverage to achieve DAO-defined goals, principally by forming an operational mesh layer and assigning internal employees or negotiating and entering into agreements with service providers and individual contributors to facilitate initiatives. OpCo’s mission is to negate identified frictions affecting the DAO’s strategy execution, such as allowing for the establishment of more operational roles for the DAO, facilitating efficient and competitive contributor and service provider negotiations and information flow between these parties, creating clear responsibilities for carrying out initiatives, and helping ensure the continuation of programs the DAO depends upon. OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes a potential advancement that could be made within its mandated focus areas, it can work on and propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Arbitrum DAO is generally unable to move swiftly when it requires specialized contributors to execute a strategy, for which there isn’t a straightforward and low-friction approach, with these processes typically requiring a vast amount of effort from the supply side instead of being driven by the demand side. Moreover, many initiatives, especially more complex and wider-reaching ones, lack clear owners in charge of ensuring a holistic approach to execution and initiatives’ continuation, meaning that in the unfortunate case that a service provider decides/is forced to disengage from its duties, there aren’t always accountable individuals or entities that would push the initiatives forward. OpCo’s goal is to function as the entity the DAO can leverage to remedy these limitations and move forward in areas that require a more structured approach.\n\nTo cover OpCo’s operating expenses over the first 30 months, including full-time staff appointed internally, setup and other admin costs, as well as the DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee, this proposal suggests earmarking 22M ARB (subject to change in either direction if market conditions change notably between the Snapshot and Tally votes) for the initiative:\n\n* 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n* Of the remaining 18M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB’s current price of $1, this would require roughly 12M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following the proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact.\n* After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 22M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\n![ARB Liquidation.png](ipfs://bafybeifs75ocgefcebce7mgv5spdjfubengcta7ua6nz5rbrlbprbbtxvq)\n\nOpCo will be able to utilize the $12M in cash equivalents as follows:\n\n* $2.5M worth of stable assets released upfront.\n* Once OpCo has officially operationalized, the entity can draw up to $500K of cash equivalents each month.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPresently, most DAO programs operate in silos, leading to, among other things, redundant efforts and non-existing cross-initiative resources. The DAO also generally depends on a single initiative leader for the continuation of a successful program, while some initiatives don’t even have clear owners, which adds significant friction to strategy execution. DAOs are also inherently disadvantaged when evaluating and swiftly engaging individual contributors or service providers, and Arbitrum is no exception. This proposal aims to provide the DAO with the capabilities to nullify the abovementioned frictions by creating a DAO-adjacent legal entity—OpCo. Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage OpCo to manage:\n\n* Operational support & project planning,\n* Project management of DAO initiatives,\n* Negotiations with service providers,\n* Allocation of resources across contributors & DAO-approved projects\n\nOpCo will grant the Arbitrum DAO better capabilities to bootstrap initiatives and secure the continuation and execution of them, while also expanding the total addressable contributor and service provider base as certain sensitive negotiations and deal terms don’t necessarily have to be disclosed publicly. Moreover, the DAO-adjacent entity will function as the operational mesh layer for individual contributors and service providers, streamlining communications and knowledge sharing across engaged entities and individuals.\n\nOverall, the DAO’s past, current, and likely upcoming initiatives can be divided into 5 high-level categories: Governance Frameworks, Financial Management, Investments, Ecosystem Support, and Grants. The initiatives, their respective owners, and into which of the 5 categories they fall are visualized below.\n\n![Current Initiatives.png](ipfs://bafybeidaponefn7ospa42xhhtdhcw2v33to5yvrskyrvcxbmtagwwl24ru)\n\nIt is of utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO maintains a decentralized and bottoms-up system for bootstrapping new projects, DAO contributors, and setting strategies, including creating and steering the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose, as well as approaches to achieve the goals and decision-making. As such, OpCo will be focused on the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management initiative categories, but note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category if the DAO so chooses through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n\nThe entity’s main focus is to increase the efficiency of strategy execution through operational optimization and, in particular, activating and recruiting the optimal stakeholders, contributors, and service providers. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO would always have ultimate authority over OpCo, with the entity purely being a helpful resource focused on streamlining wider-reaching and complex initiatives that require a more structured execution framework as well as helping push the DAO forward within areas where the entity identifies shortcomings. We want to stress the importance of ensuring that one of Arbitrum DAO’s key differentiators—enabling new participants to join the ecosystem and make an impact, growing into well-established contributors—is conserved. Without Arbitrum DAO empowering its contributors and delegates, the DAO might sacrifice one of its core strengths, and we believe that entities such as SEEDGov, Entropy Advisors, Tally, etc., are present within the ecosystem exactly because of this empowerment.\n\nArbitrum has one of the most active and engaged DAOs within the industry, combined with help from the Arbitrum Foundation and robust programs for bootstrapping and fostering growth within the ecosystem. Although there is always room for improvement, these factors have enabled the DAO to allocate grants with positive results, sustaining a vibrant and welcoming ecosystem. Having said that, if the DAO wishes to, it can expand OpCo’s mandate to include grants in the future through a Snapshot vote. When it comes to investments from treasury funds, the GCP has been established to facilitate capital allocation into the gaming sector, while the AVI is currently working on setting up a structure allowing the DAO to make venture bets across other verticals, which is why OpCo will be excluded from operating within the investments category. As alluded to earlier, we also feel as though it’s crucial that the facilitation and implementation of governance frameworks continue being driven by decentralized actors, but the DAO could again expand OpCo’s operations into this initiative category if it so wishes.\n\nWith that said, certain clear inefficiencies have been identified with respect to the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories. This is likely due to the operational frameworks enabling execution for these categories still being somewhat underexplored areas. As such, there is a lack of ownership, and the DAO has no structured way to frictionlessly operationalize contributors to push complex challenges forward within these verticals, often requiring a vast amount of Arbitrum DAO-specific knowledge and even lobbying efforts from the supply side instead of the demand side. Due to the current structure, active governance participants are generally purely incentivized to prioritize strategies that they are fit to solve. This has left certain critical domains unattended and reflects the need for an entity that could be mandated to help define the root causes of execution obstacles and provide solutions to remedy them.\n\nThe aforementioned inefficiencies are naturally amplified by the fact that the number of potential contributors is often restricted due to many initiatives requiring deep specialization. Finding the facilitators capable of managing initiatives end-to-end within these categories can be difficult. Oftentimes, the contributor and owner roles for initiatives are separated or there is not a clear owner at all, meaning that no one party is responsible for the continuation of these initiatives. For initiatives where the contributor and owner roles are the same or there is a clearly defined owner, the DAO generally relies on a single party for the continuation of the initiative. If the service provider or contributor, for any reason, decides or is forced to exit the ecosystem, there is not a well-defined framework for the initiative to be moved to a new owner.\n\nAs initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates. However, OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developments could be made, it can propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nTypically, the current protocol for the execution of strategies and new initiatives within the DAO’s two aforementioned focus areas is as follows: (i) either the proposer defines the strategic approach and goals for the initiative or a working group is created that aims to outline these specifics such that a proposal can be created, with the working group also sometimes facilitating some or all of the work required for the execution of the strategy; (ii) if not done by the working group, the proposer or proposer-connected party is contracted to facilitate the strategy or the DAO runs some type of a procurement/election process to decide the service providers or contributors; (iii) once the work has been performed and the facilitators’ term ends, a continuation proposal is created if the initiative has a clear owner. Otherwise, individual DAO contributors are required to take charge of the initiative and push it forward.\n\nIf OpCo were to be created, it would primarily be leveraged to assume responsibility for phases (ii) and (iii). I.e., the DAO defines strategies or simply strategic goals. If a clear executor to reach the key objectives exists within the DAO, they could be chosen as a facilitator and would be contracted by the OpCo. If not, OpCo could be mandated to execute these strategies by either assigning existing internal employees, hiring new internal resources, or contracting outside service providers/individual contributors to perform the required undertakings. However, if the DAO isn’t proactively defining strategies/strategic goals, OpCo is required to be active within this area as well, given it has the bandwidth to do so, with these OpCo-created strategies then ratified by the DAO through the regular voting process.\n\nOpCo would have full discretion over hiring internal employees, while anyone interested in facilitating a DAO initiative could propose themselves (or another party) for that. Such a proposal must include a capital allocation to cover the facilitator’s expenses since OpCo’s budget only covers internal employees’ salaries. If approved through governance, the facilitator would then be contracted by OpCo as a service provider for the DAO. Depending on what is viewed as the most efficient approach, OpCo will have the ability to negotiate and run procurement processes both privately and publicly, which will further strengthen the Arbitrum DAO’s ability to attract and retain top talent, with all information that can be shared with the wider DAO being made available through oversight and financial reports. The below slide depicts OpCo’s initial focus categories, but please note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category.\n\n![Future Structure.png](ipfs://bafybeiewjs6bgbqbbnrswbtdxkd2f2wr6b2ymjatwwu26ojtufsxfy3u5m)\n\nIf a DAO-ratified strategy or strategic goal that the OpCo is mandated to facilitate doesn’t have a specific end date, the DAO-adjacent entity would continue executing until the entity feels as though the associated goals have been reached or the DAO instructs the entity to stop executing by passing a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). If the work is expected to be long-term in nature, OpCo would be responsible for ensuring that it can be continued by accounting for associated costs in its budget extension request.\n\nFor example, delegates could define a high-level events strategy by deciding the number of events the Arbitrum DAO should be represented at in 2025, whether the strategy facilitator is the proposer, a proposer-related party, an OpCo internal employee, or someone who is chosen through a procurement process, and approving the strategy’s costs that are not covered by OpCo’s budget (i.e., salaries if the facilitators are not full-time staff appointed internally, booking event venues, catering, etc.) through the typical governance process, after which OpCo plans the exact events to participate in, contracts the required service providers or operationalizes internal employees, and manages all involved stakeholders and other related aspects throughout the process.\n\nService providers and individual contributors that are currently contracted, or will likely be in the near future, with the Arbitrum Foundation and fall within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories, such as SEEDGov in its role as the Delegate Incentive Program Manager, MSS members, firms forming the ADPC, Entropy Advisors, etc., should collaborate closely with OpCo once its operations are fully established and stabilized. Once fully operational, OpCo will have the capacity to project manage and oversee these initiatives according to its complete mandate. The long-term vision for this process is as follows:\n\n1. OpCo’s core team is hired, and operations begin;\n2. OpCo demonstrates product-market fit (i.e., the DAO is satisfied with the entity’s output) and that it has adequate processes, capabilities, and any other relevant functions to execute according to its complete mandate;\n3. OpCo is prepared to oversee full-time DAO operations, assuming existing contributor contracts through novation and managing new initiatives on behalf of the DAO (e.g., by ensuring that appropriate KYC measures and documentation are implemented).\n\nIn the case that an integral facilitator within the Ecosystem Support or Financial Management categories (or any other category OpCo might be mandated to operate within in the future) exits the ecosystem for any reason and an initiative is left without an owner, the DAO could likewise mandate OpCo to find a replacement solution.\n\nIt’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm). OpCo internal full-time employees cannot be contributors to DAO initiatives as individuals (they need to do so through OpCo) and are strictly prohibited from entering into employment engagements with other DAOs, organizations, entities, or comparable affiliations, whilst contractors that facilitate a specific vertical and are signed to OpCo can have engagements in other DAO initiatives and outside of the ecosystem. Full-time OpCo staff can only be appointed internally. However, as mentioned earlier, the DAO can roll any service provider or individual contributor into OpCo by passing an onchain vote. This vote has to request capital to cover the facilitators’ expenses since when it comes to salaries, OpCo’s budget only covers internal full-time staff. OpCo is expected to work closely with Offchain Labs as well as the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that scopes of work do not overlap.\n\nIndividual contributors, service providers, and other analogous entities are naturally free to go directly to the DAO to propose they facilitate a workstream and get paid for it without facilitation by the OpCo. However, if the proposed scope of work falls within OpCo’s mandate, it is expected that delegates vote against such a proposal if it can be better executed via OpCo’s involvement. Proposers will be encouraged to engage with OpCo before posting a proposal to the forum to align with the DAO-adjacent entity’s internal employees. OpCo’s internal employees will also proactively communicate with proposal authors and facilitators outside of OpCo such that there is no overlap between deliverables and the future plans for all initiatives are clear.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to mention that the introduction of a DAO-adjacent legal entity carries risks and burdens that shouldn’t be ignored. Among other things, it requires some trust in a select group of facilitators as they are responsible for hiring and procuring the correct contributors as well as operationalizing and managing the DAO-adjacent entity, OpCo’s setup and fixed costs are quite notable, and some amount of administrative work is required that otherwise wouldn’t have arisen.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## OpCo Operational Process\n\nWe expect the general workflow for OpCo to be as follows:\n\n* A forum discussion is initiated, with the owner of that discussion having communicated with OpCo and defined whether the covered subject falls within OpCo’s initial mandate, i.e., the Financial Management or Ecosystem Support verticals.\n* For verticals that are included in OpCo’s mandate, a discussion could broadly take one of the following forms:\n  * A new key objective is introduced, but the roadmap to achieve that objective is unclear: Delegates have the option to create a Snapshot proposal to direct OpCo to produce an onchain proposal that defines the strategy to achieve the key objective(s), whether the entity would procure a facilitator or hire/operationalize an internal employee, as well as any funds needed to cover the strategy’s expenses, excluding OpCo’s internal employee costs. If approved, OpCo would begin facilitating the proposal created by itself. It’s important to note that OpCo, together with its oversight committee (OAT), is responsible for keeping the DAO informed about the entity’s bandwidth. They’ll also provide updates on when current projects are expected to end. This ensures that if there is a sudden spike in new proposals, especially complex and more time-intensive ones, delegates can prioritize and vote on the ones OpCo can take on.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, but the incentive program’s structure and size are unclear. A proposal is passed for OpCo to operationalize internal employees and create the exact strategy. OpCo then defines, e.g., the amount of incentives to be distributed, what the application process to receive incentives looks like, how success will be measured, etc. A proposal to ratify the strategy, the incentives to be distributed, and the required workforce is then created. If passed, OpCo will activate the needed facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) and strategy execution begins.\n  * A new key objective is introduced and the roadmap to achieve that objective is clear: Delegates approve an onchain proposal that defines the strategy, whether the facilitator is the proposer, proposer-related party, an internal OpCo employee, or someone the OpCo procures, and the related expenses excluding facilitator fees for internal OpCo employees, after which strategy execution begins. If a proposal introduces a new key objective with a clear roadmap but that roadmap is ambitious, the OAT together with OpCo should signal how feasible it is for the entity to execute the proposal. If it’s determined that such a roadmap is feasible, the OAT together with OpCo would also communicate whether or not the entity needs more internal resources to be able to execute.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, and the structure and size are clear. An onchain proposal to ratify the strategy, the facilitators, and the capital needed is then created. If passed, the required facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) are contracted by OpCo, or OpCo operationalizes/hires internal employees, depending on the DAO’s decision, and the strategy is activated.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n* Proposals and their execution can still be DAO-led end-to-end and outside of OpCo if delegates vote in this regard. OpCo is a tool for the DAO to leverage if needed.\n* The DAO-adjacent entity is required to be proactive, meaning that internal employees need to actively give feedback in the forums and participate in opinionated discussions.\n* Furthermore, if OpCo has available bandwidth, it should identify areas within its mandated verticals where improvements could be made. If there is no clear owner for such areas and addressing them would benefit the DAO, OpCo should take action. OpCo can create a proposal to define the strategy for addressing the targeted area, requesting funds to cover expenses, excluding costs for OpCo’s internal employees and other related operating expenses, and authorizing the DAO-adjacent entity to operationalize facilitators to execute the strategy.\n\nOpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee. After OpCo’s core team has been hired, the entity has demonstrated product-market fit and readiness to execute according to its complete mandate, OpCo could be leveraged to help develop a DAO-wide budget, in which case the DAO-adjacent entity could hold the budgeted capital for at least the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management categories. In this case, when proposals related to these verticals are passed, no capital would have to be moved from the treasury as OpCo would be able to cover all expenses from its holdings.\n\n## Establishing OpCo\n\nExploratory work on OpCo’s legal structure has already been initiated, but further effort and consultation with key stakeholders, delegates, legal parties, and the Arbitrum Foundation are needed to hammer down the exact structure. Any costs incurred by the Foundation for setting up the legal structure would be reimbursed from capital allocated to this initiative if this proposal were to pass.\n\nOpCo’s initial term will tentatively be 30 months (around 6 months for setup and 24 months for operations from the entity’s official initiation date). The initial term’s length has been chosen to allow ample time for any unforeseen delays in establishing the legal entity, ramping up and stabilizing its operations, and will enable OpCo to focus on more complex and long-term strategies and internalize top talent as a longer initial term provides predictability/job security for employees. Once the first term is coming to an end, the executive-equivalent internal personnel together with OpCo’s oversight committee—the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), introduced below—are required to collaborate to create the continuation proposal for the DAO-adjacent entity. This is expected to cover, among other things, the second OpCo term’s length, the required budget, and any changes or improvements that should be made. It should be noted that if OpCo is required to internalize a vast amount of facilitator roles before a DAO-wide budget is put in place, OpCo might have to create a proposal that would allocate additional funds as its initial exemplary budget has been constructed to cover up to 12 internal full-time employees at different salaries.\n\nTo enable OpCo to successfully fulfill its mandate, the entity should, among other things, have the following initial operational capabilities, internal employees, and resources:\n\n* Internal Finances, Financial Rails, and Controls\n  * Appoint an external accounting and audit firm to maintain financial records and create yearly audits of financial statements and internal controls.\n  * Banking capabilities to be able to convert stablecoins into fiat currency and pay service providers not accepting tokens.\n* Legal\n  * Hire a full-time, in-house legal counsel.\n  * Obtain the required insurances that cover the DAO-adjacent entity as well as internal employees and the OAT.\n* Business-Critical Software\n  * Acquire any needed collaboration and communication tools, accounting and financial management software, human resources management systems, etc.\n* Internal Executive-Equivalent Employees\n  * Chief Chaos Coordinator\n    * Ensures that OpCo has the required internal resources, employees, and contracted service providers such that the DAO-adjacent entity can operate properly and execute strategies mandated by the DAO.\n    * Responsible for building and advancing the entity’s operational structure and managing workflows as initiatives are rolled into the organization and new focus areas are introduced.\n    * Similarly to other executive-equivalent personnel, accountable for adequate record keeping and internal controls.\n    * Collaborates with any other executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT to produce bi-annual oversight and financial reports.\n    * Together with executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT, in charge of creating the continuation proposal for OpCo’s next term.\n  * Chief of Coins\n    * Works with the relevant parties to produce a detailed, actual budget for OpCo, ratified by the OAT and the DAO. In the future, we expect the Chief of Coins to help facilitate a DAO-wide budget together with the relevant parties.\n    * Before a DAO-wide budget is created, responsible for requesting additional funds to ensure the entity’s operations if capital allocated for OpCo’s OpEx is close to being depleted.\n    * Verifies that allocated funds are custodied in a secure manner and utilized as intended.\n    * Makes sure that the OAT and the DAO have required visibility into ongoing expenses, how financials are expected to develop, and any other relevant considerations.\n    * Monitors Arbitrum’s financial performance and makes new recommendations based on this information.\n    * Closely collaborates with entities and individuals responsible for treasury management-related tasks, enabling the creation of a unified asset allocation and risk diversification strategy in line with the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose.\n    * Manages accounting, payroll, and payment infrastructure.\n\n## OpCo KPIs\n\nWe are looking for community feedback on this front, but some potential, apparent KPIs for OpCo (h/t [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) for most of these) include:\n\n* Talent Acquisition, Service Provider Selection, and Program Management\n  * Decrease in time-to-hire, compared to the DAO’s previous structure\n  * Employee engagement and satisfaction\n  * Retention rate\n  * Share of service providers meeting or exceeding performance metrics\n  * Cost savings or added value generated\n  * Diversity of service providers engaged\n* Ecosystem Coordination\n  * Time to solve open questions and other ambiguities\n  * Number of initiatives facilitated and their success\n  * Level of community engagement and stakeholder satisfaction\n  * Agility in adapting objectives\n  * Share of OpCo-initiated strategies accepted by the DAO\n* Performance Tracking and Transparency\n  * Timeliness of oversight and financial reports\n  * Share of data and metrics made publicly available\n  * Community engagement with reports\n\nUltimately, the OAT will be responsible for designing, finalizing, and implementing the relevant KPIs once OpCo is at a point where this can be sufficiently done. We envision that this will be a collaborative effort between the OAT and the DAO, with KPIs reviewed and adjusted periodically based on how OpCo evolves and the community’s feedback.\n\n## OpCo Accountability – The Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT)\n\nThe OAT is a group of five individuals with the primary mandate to oversee OpCo’s operations, ensure the DAO maintains transparency into the DAO-adjacent entity, function as the coordinator between the DAO and OpCo, and establish clear communication channels with the other committees overseeing the separate DAO-adjacent entities such as the GCP and possibly the CapCo in the future should the DAO vote accordingly. More specifically, the OAT’s responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n\n* Accountability: Ensures that OpCo is not overstepping its mandate, over-hiring doesn’t take place, and execution is constrained solely to strategies approved by the DAO. Holds the executive-equivalent personnel accountable, helps produce and approves bi-annual oversight and financial reports, designs relevant KPIs for OpCo once the entity is at a point where this can be sufficiently done, and gives other quarterly updates to the community (such as how OpCo is progressing towards the KPIs designed by the OAT, any operational developments, etc.), reviews all relevant internal materials, and monitors that funds held in OpCo-related wallets are used correctly.\n* Operational Support: Provides assistance in the entity’s legal setup process, gives guidance on OpCo’s operational development, assists the executive-equivalent personnel in producing a continuation proposal for OpCo, and continuously guides OpCo-related contributors to align with the DAO’s will.\n* Hiring, Termination, & Authorization: The OAT, in collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, would hire the executive-equivalent personnel to the OpCo (the Chief Chaos Coordinator, the Chief of Coins, and any other positions of equivalent responsibility that may be introduced in the future) once the legal entity is established. The OAT will help onboard the executive-equivalent personnel and assist in the creation of a standardized onboarding process for future internal employees such that new hires’ expectations are managed properly. Once the first internal employees are hired, the OAT would act as the approving authority when OpCo enters into contracts with service providers or individual contributors, as well as greenlight salaries, larger spends, expenses, and budgets, having the authority to challenge decisions made within OpCo that may have a material, negative impact. Moreover, the OAT would be empowered to terminate service provider/individual contributor/etc. contracts as well as fire OpCo’s internal staff. If the OAT decides to take such an action, the concerned party will be suspended from their duties, and payments will be halted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Removal of OAT Members: OAT Members may be removed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a violation of a conflict of interest or other OpCo policies. In the event of a violation: (A) an OAT Member may call up an internal vote for removal with a memo detailing the alleged violation; (B) for a vote to remove an OAT Member to pass, it must have at least 4 out of the 5 OAT Members voting in favor; and (C) the ArbitrumDAO may also call for a vote to remove OAT Members at any time pursuant to a Temperature Check vote in accordance with the quorum and voting threshold requirements of a Temperature Check. The OpCo Team has the ability to call for a Temperature Check vote to remove an OAT Member as voted upon by the ArbitrumDAO. (i) The OpCo Team member may flag to another OpCo Team member that an election to remove an OAT Member via a Temperature Check vote is warranted; (ii) If such other OpCo Team member considers the request for removal to be warranted, then the OpCo Team member who originally made the flag may call for a removal election (subject to a 3 day feedback period, followed by a 7 day voting period) as a Temperature Check vote; (iii) In the event that a call to remove fails, the OpCo Team member who called for such Temperature Check vote cannot call another vote for removal for a period of 3 months. The process for electing a replacement for a removed OAT member will be equivalent to how the removed member was elected. I.e., if the removed member was elected through a DAO vote, the replacement member will be elected through a DAO vote. If the removed member was elected by the OAT, the OAT will elect the replacement member. A removed OAT member cannot be reappointed to the OAT. Further details on the OAT election process are given below.\n* Coordination: Actively engage with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to align on deliverables and serve as the liaison between delegates, key stakeholders, the wider DAO, and other DAO-adjacent entities’ oversight committees. The OAT will also initiate a monthly OpCo oversight call for community members to get updates on the most recent developments and for them to have the opportunity to make inquiries. A separate forum section will be created for OpCo.\n\n## OAT Election Process\n\nIf this proposal were to pass Snapshot, the formation of the Oversight and Transparency Committee would commence. The DAO would elect 3 individuals to the OAT, with these individuals then promptly appointing 2 additional members with specialized skill sets to ensure all Arbitrum stakeholders’ interests are represented and the OAT’s proficiencies are varied and complete. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation will be given an observing and non-voting sixth seat on the OAT similar to the GCP. OAT members are expected to be able to contribute at least 10 hours per week to OAT-related tasks.\n\nOAT applicants are required to apply as individuals to increase accountability. Applicants are required to disclose any current or possible future conflicts of interest in their applications, including but not limited to financial, personal, and professional. Applicants are also required to disclose all active contributor roles and payment streams related to the Arbitrum DAO that they, and entities that they have a professional or financial relationship with, have and are receiving. The application process for the 3 DAO-elected members would be initiated soon after the OpCo proposal passes an offchain vote and would run for ~3 weeks. Note that the application period can be extended if the size of the applicant pool is limited. A shutterized, weighted voting system will be utilized on Snapshot, and the 3 applicants with the most votes will be chosen as members of the OAT. The DAO-elected members should then prioritize appointing 2 additional members (required to be individuals as well). The 2 additional members don’t have to be appointed at the same time. The additional members will be added to the OAT optimistically, with the DAO having the ability to reject either/both of the additional members through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). All members will serve until the end of the first OAT term unless removed or they resign.\n\nWhile the same internal OpCo employees as well as contracted service providers and individual contributors will continue in their roles across OpCo’s terms if the DAO-adjacent entity is extended in the future, the OAT’s term is 12 months, with a re-election process initiated when the OAT’s term has around 3 months left. The DAO would again choose 3 members who then appoint 2 additional members. If the new cohort is different from the previous one, the previous OAT members are expected to help onboard the new members when the term is coming to an end. There are no consecutive term limits for OAT members. As the OAT is mandated to assist in OpCo’s setup process, the first OAT term will be slightly longer than subsequent ones since it will include the period from when the initial OAT members are selected to the establishment of the entity, plus 12 months from the entity’s official start date.\n\nAny individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-obseving seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\n# NOTE: Due to Snapshot's character limit and the length of this proposal, the following sections have been omitted from this text compared to the forum post: OAT Applicant Requirements, OAT Compensation Structure, Governance and Compliance Requirements for OpCo, its Internal Employees, and the OAT, OpCo Financials and Costs, Snapshot Voting Structure, and Timeline.

        "body": "## **Abstract**\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal represents an improved version compared to previous initiatives and requests for comments (RFCs):\n\n- [[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-2-delegate-incentive-system-for-arbitrumdao/15720)\n- [[DRAFT] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/16501)\n\nWe have developed this new proposal considering the comments and observations provided by other delegates. Our additional motivation lies in the recent increase in proposals and increased activity within ArbitrumDAO. We believe that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes.\n\n# **Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## **Before reading the proposal, note how we have decided to structure it**\n\nThis proposal is structured into four main sections:\n\n* **Option 1:** This is our main proposal detailing all the specifications of the incentive system.\n* **Option 2:** Introduces the implementation of \"Karma\" to automate certain processes. It's important to note that this option entails additional costs.\n* **General Summary:** An overview of the proposed items.\n* **Next Steps:** Voting deadline\n\n# **Option 1 - Main Proposal**\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number at **50 delegates**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a reasonable starting point.\n\n## Funding\n\n- Incentives for delegates: 1,500,000 ARB\n- Incentive Program Administrator: 25,000 ARB\n\n## Delegate Selection Process\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\n> * So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\n> * The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\n> * Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:\n> 1. [Core Test Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/60371879178081104082641012273221287927865067413661362234634146098631763379427)\n> 2.

They must post using the template provided below, within a 7-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\n> * Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid on a monthly basis, we will use a point system and a framework that will be made public.\n\n![scores.png](ipfs://bafybeieuu4yypwmkapdkznz4arvsci7t7ond4a7qh55us2fuz5ijjbhwsa)\n    \n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. This parameter is extracted from Tally. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR * 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Tn) /SV(Fn)) * 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Fn) - TV(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Fn) - CR(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Fn) - CP(Rn)) * 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 * TP% / 100))**\n\n#### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n- Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n- Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n- Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n- Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n- Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no? \n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Delegate Responsibilities\n\nDelegates are responsible for keeping track of their actions. At the end of the month, they have until the 3rd of the following month to submit a forum post with the following requirements:\n\n* A copy (Link) of the framework with their activity data for that month.\n* Additionally, the post must have a summary with all the links including:\n  * Snapshot voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the reasoning behind the snapshot vote\n  * Tally voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the tally vote reasoning (if you have changed your vote)\n  * Commenting on Proposals link (only those that went to snapshots)\n* The summary should also include:\n  * Delegate proposal links\n  * Links to any significant contribution (discussion, questions, suggestions, etc.) made to a proposal.\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Delegates failing to post the requested information will not receive incentives.\n> * To avoid forum spam and disarray, we will ask the facilitators to add a channel for the incentive system so delegates can input all their information there.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nAfter the delegates post and present their results in the framework, the incentive system administrator has 10 days to gather all the information, review, verify, and unify it. Then, present all the unified data on the forum in the [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862) and attach a summary explaining that month's final result.\n\nOnce the final result is presented, delegates have 2 days to file a claim in case of disagreement.\n\n#### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success. \n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be sent as a proposal to Tally, with full details of the payments, between the 16th and 17th. This will be repeated for the 6 months, so that the DAO has control over the incentive program and can cut it off whenever it wants.\n\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\nEstimated schedule:\n\n![schedule.png](ipfs://bafkreie7nlxyh7jx7myxgfj6eqogu6p7kfebmokq3v5fvxzskmmb7j2h64)\n    \n### Administrator Perspective\n\n1. Start of the month: Track delegate participation in governance.\n2. Last day of the month: Begin collecting delegate posts from the forum.\n3. Review all the information, check for accuracy, and compile it into the framework.\n4. Establish the results within the given timeframe.\n5. If everyone agrees, send a proposal to Tally with the payment details, to be voted on.\n6. Keep the DAO informed\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the adminstration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the adminstration of said program the budget would be 25,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator.\n\n---\n\n# **Option 2 - Karma automation for delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n**Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n- **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n- **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n- **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n- **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n- **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n- **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n### Cost\n\n- 30000 ARB\n\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nAs with Option 1, we are also open to having a group of delegates or potentially a third party administer Karma's progress and the program, in which case we would obviously provide all necessary assistance.\n\nFor the administration of the program for this option the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator. \n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\nProposal overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## CONT IN FORUM POST",

As the first two employees at Blockworks Research, we felt the vision of what DAOs could deliver versus what they actually resembled in reality warranted more dedicated attention from a team passionate about the potential impact DAOs could have on an ecosystem. It has now been 14 months since Entropy Advisors was incorporated, and while we have accomplished a lot, there is a vast amount of work that remains.\n\nAs this term comes to a close on August 31st, we want to take the opportunity to say thank you to those in the Arbitrum community who have supported our team and given us a path to make an impact on such a large stage by funding us through our first DAO [proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/22562217031893796518849144396978331510254494883851105730012486117405397295942). Without the Arbitrum DAO, Entropy Advisors would not have been possible.\n\nThis proposal is to extend our partnership with the DAO for two additional years. If passed, our second official engagement would go into effect on September 1, 2025, immediately following the conclusion of our first mandate. Entropy Advisors’ exclusive focus over the next two years is transforming Arbitrum into the most effective capital allocating DAO in crypto, leveraging treasury strategy, incentives design, data, and special projects to drive compounding, sustainable ecosystem growth\n\n# Motivation and Rationale\n\n## Year 1 Retrospective\n\nWe invite everyone to review our initial [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/entropy-advisors-exclusively-working-with-arbitrum-dao/25246) and reflect on our successes and failures, and to provide candid feedback to our team as we begin the process towards a second term.\n---\n### Proposals-as-a-Service (PaaS)\n\n* Neutral Proposal Broker\n* Hold introductory strategy meetings with key Arbitrum stakeholders and partners to help them navigate the DAO. Facilitate introductions between delegates, contributors, DAO leaders, and key strategic partners.\n* Assist with drafting and delivering proposals from select third parties to the DAO.\n* Proposal Incubation\n* Facilitate the oversight and creation of neutral DAO frameworks and initiatives that do not benefit Entropy and only have the DAO’s best interests in mind.\n* The idea behind Entropy is to assemble a team composed of highly capable DAO contributors with differing perspectives and expertises—we will use our collective brain power to create proposals that benefit Arbitrum over the long term and are aligned with community priorities.\n* Enable the DAO to expedite and refine proposals more precisely, addressing the recurring issue of proposals being approved without sufficient details on execution and long-term planning.\n\n### Strategy and Ecosystem Alignment\n\n* Serve as the liaison between Arbitrum’s key stakeholders\n* Host meetings with key stakeholders and report needs and updates between the relevant parties. Report notes to DAO when able.\n* Turn conversations and takeaways into an actionable plan and begin executing.\n* Product and Strategy\n* Regularly discuss with application developers within the Arbitrum ecosystem, relay this information to development teams/the Foundation, and use the insights to create discussions with clear goals on the Arbitrum governance forum.\n* Assist the key stakeholders on partnerships/integrations as needed. We will serve as an extra set of eyes to highlight emerging technologies and trends within crypto, aiding Arbitrum parties when we can be helpful.\n* Generally speaking, ensure that the Arbitrum DAO is on track to becoming a sustainable entity with sensible spending and a focus on profit generation.\n\n---\n\n**Full-time Arbitrum DAO:** We grew the team from just Sam and Matt to 8 full-time and 1 intern, and we remain laser-focused on attracting the highest quality talent in the space to commit themselves exclusively to Arbitrum. While we believe that we have formed a very strong team thus far, the composition of our team will always be a top priority to ensure we have the tools at our disposal to serve the ecosystem with high-quality execution. In the coming year, we would like to continue growing as needs arise: more data analytics help, applied researchers, TradFi converts, and those with early-stage experience are at the top of mind, with a goal of scaling beyond 10 members on our team.\n![Entropy Proposal 2.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigvqpdyawvkfjl7z2whdmf4cxmyt2ujriakmqllaj3dvk76tu5u2a)\n\n**Beyond Proposals:** Over the past year, Entropy has evolved beyond just a proposals shop and become a recognizable, consistent face of the Arbitrum DAO in the broader crypto community. From press to partnerships, conferences to committees, we’ve built a strong reputation for professionalism, reliability, and alignment. Our ability to foster trust across stakeholders from Offchain Labs and the Foundation to top investors, asset managers, and builders has been one of our most important assets, and something we intend to amplify in years 2 and 3. We recognize that this is where we have produced the most value throughout our first year and aim to continue to grow into our strengths. On countless occasions, we have joined Offchain Labs and Arbitrum Foundation’s partnerships teams in helping outline strategy and closing deals. With some blue-chip ecosystem partners, Entropy works as their main point of contact in Arbitrum. We have grown into a trusted tool augmenting existing AAEs.\n\n**Syncing Stakeholders:** We are happy with our output over the past ~year in regards to the first two deliverables we outlined (see above). We hosted three (a fourth is planned for EthCC) “Delegate Days” in Brussels, Bangkok, and Denver over the past year, where we gathered large delegates, members from Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation, and other stakeholders to align on key objectives over the subsequent quarter(s). We also hosted key stakeholder calls with the same groups once per month in an effort to align on high-importance topics that require attention in the near term. Entropy has also been speaking with OCL, the AF, and key delegates and ecosystem contributors every two weeks to streamline communications across the ecosystem. These efforts are quite time-consuming, but have proven to lead to some of our most impactful work over the past year.\n\n**Strategic Proposals:** We successfully passed a plethora of proposals authored internally, as well as assisted third parties in drafting proposals to the DAO or submitting applications to DAO-led programs. Some examples here include Govhack Brussels, the MSS, The Ethereum Attackathon Sponsorship, leading the ARB staking working group and bolstering the quality of contributors to the research (bringing in Vending Machine and ASXN to assist), the Delegate Code of Conduct, establishing an events budget, getting treasury management moving forward after a long stagnation through the v1.2 proposal, leading the STEP II committee, moving forward with the MVP exercise to align stakeholders, our DRIP proposal to reignite incentives/support for builders and users, the Stylus Sprint, assisting Max Lomu with his chain abstraction proposal, etc. We can’t touch on all of them here, but please refer to our forum [profile](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/entropy/summary) for more information.\n\nImportantly, in many cases, we evaluated whether supporting external contributors/committees or internalizing portions of execution made the most sense for the DAO. In some instances, we chose to execute internally, not because we wanted less external contribution, but because we deemed it the most efficient, high-context, and cost-effective way to get things done. Our north star has always been to make DAO execution smoother, more strategic, and resource-efficient. Sometimes that meant helping third parties structure their ideas, but other times it meant owning the process ourselves to ensure tighter execution, lower overhead, and greater accountability.\n\n**OpCo Groundwork:** We also laid the groundwork for a more expedited proposal process by helping mold the new direction for the Arbitrum DAO, which was recently [posted](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/a-vision-for-the-future-of-arbitrum/28962?u=entropy) by the AF, and we also created the [OpCo proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/41351298371775353090222506531903916823291804644712693824312064183457809617851?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) that should make working with the DAO a much smoother process from the perspective of service providers.\n\nWe expect OpCo to pick up the portion of the aforementioned work that relates to key stakeholder alignment and coordination once it is fully operational. Aligning all the largest stakeholders in the ecosystem in order to allow for more effective operations was a massive undertaking and took a large amount of our bandwidth over the course of our first year. Despite the large investment of time and resources, we believe the groundwork has been laid for a more fruitful future for the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n**Learning from Mistakes:** While we feel as though we did a great job on setting the DAO’s future, more efficient path, we certainly fell short on numerous occasions. For example, there were some instances in which we poorly communicated with certain ecosystem participants during application processes. As members of the GMC, many protocols that have sunk significant resources into the ecosystem felt overlooked and undercommunicated with. Our team has since shifted focus to improving our relationships with Arbitrum builders and to being more mindful in providing feedback to applicants by overcommunicating. We also realize that our scope of work was extremely wide in our first proposal, and our deliverables have evolved quite a lot since our engagement started, which might have led to some confusion in the wider community around what Entropy’s role actually is. Our wins have taught us a lot, but our mistakes even more, and we are committed to making corrections based on our learnings throughout our first year in our second engagement.\n\n---\nData and Brand Building\n\n* Build up a high-value brand through various mediums, such as X/Twitter with educational content and research, YouTube/Apple/Spotify through a podcast, and email through weekly newsletters.\n* Bring visibility into DAO initiatives and RFPs.\n* Represent the DAO professionally and with a demeanor that the community can be proud of.\n* Aid DAO-funded organizations like the ARDC and OBL in conducting research and analytics to inform proposal development.\n* Utilize data analytics to help the DAO with accountability and transparency around its initiatives.\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Analytics:** In terms of data and brand building, we are very happy with our output over our first ~year. Our data team has created the go-to [Dune catalog](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors) for those looking for greater insight into the Arbitrum ecosystem. It is worth noting that our data team did not begin work until around the end of December, so we have accomplished a lot here in very little time. We have had numerous investors not currently involved in the Arbitrum ecosystem reach out in admiration, which we believe will have a positive downstream impact that is not easily quantifiable. We have also seen our charts shared across dozens of large accounts on X, featured in blogs and news articles, and referred to during big moments for the ecosystem, such as the rollout of [Timeboost](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-timeboost). We have created a [DAO financials](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-financials) dashboard to give delegates better insight into how the DAO spends/earns money, a [dashboard](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-governance-proposals) that enables delegates to dissect various proposals at a granular level, an [RWA case](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-rwa-case-study) study, a [DAO treasury](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-treasury) dashboard showing all the assets it owns, and [more](https://dune.com/discover/content/relevant?q=author:entropy_advisors&resource-type=dashboards).\n\n![Entropy Proposal 3.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeif5zdnyqlkvlsedvyndilxyu6kdfxihxub7rpcfwfb7bli6gt6mue)\n\n**Data as a Growth Support Mechanism:** We also learned that data transparency can serve as a great tool for both increasing our reach across various crypto communities as well as improving relationships on the BD front with builders. This complements the goal stated in the previous section of helping to onboard 3rd parties into the ecosystem. For example, we created the most comprehensive data overview of Ethena, which caught the team’s attention. Members of Entropy then worked with OCL to coordinate a trip to the UK at the end of 2024 to meet the Ethena team as they were deciding which tech stack to deploy Converge on. In April 2025, we saw these efforts pay off with Ethena and Securitize [choosing the Arbitrum stack](https://x.com/convergeonchain/status/1912853619038461967).\n\nWe have ambitions to aid more builders within the Arbitrum ecosystem as a support mechanism, and to continue building resources that serve as both marketing material and a BD tool. Where we fell short on brand relative to our original proposal was podcast content/weekly newsletters. While we view this content as valuable, we simply did not have the bandwidth to prioritize these types of initiatives when considering the high-importance items we needed to facilitate. Additionally, we see room for growth as we expand our content outside of solely Arbitrum core and into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Over the next 2 years, we will create more dashboards that cover apps and infra that are well-positioned to support the expansion of the Arbitrum tech stack, with the goal of encouraging more partners to consider an Arbitrum deployment/support.\n\n**Recognition by News Outlets:** We regularly post threads on X and LinkedIn that highlight important initiatives that are ongoing in the Arbitrum DAO, but we do know that we need to expand our reach to maximize our impact. Members of the Entropy team have been quoted in The Block, Blockworks, CoinDesk, Unchained, and Yahoo Finance about our work in Arbitrum on numerous occasions. Additionally, we have represented Arbitrum on a few podcasts. at multiple conferences, and even in an official Arbitrum marketing video. Although we have plenty of room to keep improving our public brand, we are happy with the growth in the first year.\n\n![Entropy Proposal 4.jpg](ipfs://bafybeig3amkztpwwz3zq5m6n34e3g5aob77n4on74q455u62yxjzoilt3m)\n\n**Acknowledgment by Investors:** Large ARB token holders have evidently taken notice of our ability to push forward initiatives, be more critical of each individual spending request, and our focus on ecosystem growth, long-term sustainability, and revenue diversification, which has manifested through our rise in voting power. Our ascension to the top of the [ARB delegates](https://dune.com/queries/4713840/7834608) by voting power is a responsibility we do not take lightly, and is something we are really proud of. In our opinion, this signals to us that we are prioritizing the right things and are in the early stages of helping steward the DAO’s path forward.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Vision for Years 2 and 3\n\nNow that it’s increasingly likely that the DAO’s operational structure will include officially recognized AAEs, the path has been paved for Entropy Advisors to shift our focus more fully toward growth, sustainability, and strategic execution. While the OpCo comes to fruition, Entropy will continue to support operations- and oversight-focused initiatives that require continuity. Topics like administering the ARB Staking Working Group, supporting ARDC v2, leading programs like Watchdog and MSS, and maintaining the Delegate Code of Conduct will likely transition over to OpCo, and we will be here to ensure a smooth handoff. We expect this transition to be ongoing throughout the entirety of 2025, with the operations-related workload easing on Entropy's end by the beginning of 2026.\n\nEntropy Advisors' singular focus over the next two years is to help the Arbitrum DAO mature into a disciplined capital allocator. We will spearhead building an organization that drives compounding, sustainable ecosystem growth.\n\nArbitrum is now positioned to act more like a sovereign wealth fund: managing a composable treasury, deploying capital with strategic intent, and aligning incentives to deepen protocol adoption and ecosystem loyalty. Entropy's work across treasury design and management, incentive architecture, data transparency, and ecosystem relationships will operate in tandem to realize this vision.\n\nThe strategy boils down to:\n\n* Build a high-quality treasury of productive, composable assets (LSTs, T-bills, etc.)\n* Deploy a large share of holdings across DeFi as protocol-owned liquidity to generate yield, support aligned builders, and establish Arbitrum leverage. This function will also help onboard new partners, as the DAO will act as an initial source of demand\n* Layer in structured, app-agnostic incentives (DRIP) to attract usage and reinforce protocol alignment\n* Use analytics and reporting to increase visibility, optimize decision-making, and build external trust\n* Leverage relationships and special projects to scale adoption, reinforce values, and extend reach\n\nIn short, we stop throwing darts at the wall and start **designing growth**: capital-efficient, data-informed, and strategically aligned.\n\nOur high-level objectives to achieve the above strategy are as follows, with more details in each deliverable section below:\n\n* Smooth handover to OpCo of DAO operations- and communications-related tasks, while filling the gaps in the interim as needed.\n* Maximize the number of dapps and RWAs that “call Arbitrum Home” by designing treasury management and incentive programs that support BD efforts. Bolster this through data analytics support as a white glove services offering.\n* Formalize the DAO’s financial processes, optimize and introduce revenue streams, ensure AEP licensing fees are paid and idle non-native assets are put to work in DeFi in accordance with portfolio management policies, and continually monitor key protocol revenue drivers like Timeboost and the transaction fee mechanism.\n* Professionalize and iterate on various areas within the Arbitrum DAO, such as the early-stage support funnel or data transparency, by altering their structures and implementing custom front ends.\n\n**Ultimately, our primary goal through 2027 is to make Arbitrum the leading tech stack for builders, institutions, innovators, and users alike; powered by a sustainable flywheel of compounding growth leading to value generation.**\n\n### Financial Planning, Analysis, and Guiding Capital Deployment\n\nEntropy will work closely with AAEs, vendors, and ecosystem teams to build out the DAO’s core financial infrastructure. We believe that the long-term viability of the Arbitrum DAO hinges on prudent asset management, disciplined budgeting, and strategic cash flow deployment to generate additional income, compound growth, and deepen our ecosystem’s liquidity while supporting integral builders. It’s worth emphasizing that while we work on financially sound structures, growth will always be at the forefront of our work in the ecosystem.\n\nOur responsibilities here will include:\n\n* Tracking and consolidating key financial figures, including revenue sources (AEP Licensing Fees, Timeboost, Transaction Fees, Treasury Management activity, and others that may arise), the DAO’s assets/liabilities, as well as realized expenses to set up and maintain in-depth financial statements.\n* Building models to project DAO financials and scenario-plan various budget configurations.\n* Providing recommendations for capital allocation, including ecosystem-growth targeting activities, income-generating initiatives, cost-cutting opportunities, and diversified treasury strategies.\n* Procuring service providers and conducting outreach to protocols for initiatives classified under the Arbitrum Treasury Management Council (GMC, TMC, STEP)\n* Supporting the DAO with real-time, bespoke financial dashboards, posting quarterly DAO financial reports to the forum, and ensuring the proper risk analysis measures are in place. This reporting will take place across all of the DAO’s financial and asset-allocation activity, including the assets that currently fall under STEP, TMC, GMC, and other future initiatives.\n* Working cross-functionally with all of the AAEs to create aligned, sustainable cross-functional capital deployment plans across the DAO’s initiatives.\n\nUltimately, our goal is to provide the DAO with the tools, data, and guidance necessary to fund innovation responsibly, while positioning Arbitrum to be financially self-sustaining over the coming years.\n\n### Incentives\n\nWe believe incentives will play a major role in Arbitrum's next phase of growth, especially given the increased attention on dapp performance and ecosystem competitiveness. Our team will build upon the groundwork laid in the DRIP proposal to establish a long-term incentives strategy.\n\nKey areas of focus:\n\n* Continue leading incentive design frameworks, being the main party responsible for the success of approved programs\n* Draft and refine incentive programs, ensuring data-driven optimization throughout the programs’ lifecycle and that low-return programs are swiftly discontinued\n* Work with ecosystem teams (dApps, infra, new deployments) to scope incentive programs that accelerate high-growth opportunities sustainably.\n* Facilitate real-time data for the DAO to follow the progress of incentive programs, analyze the effectiveness of implemented programs, and deliver actionable feedback loops to improve upon them.\n* Interface with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure growth programs run by the aforementioned entities and the DAO are synergistic.\n\nEntropy’s goal is to bring structure and discipline to a chaotic incentives landscape. We see ourselves as the party relentlessly focused on continuous iteration, eliminating inefficiencies, and driving outcomes.\n\n### Ecosystem Data\n\nWe plan to double down on our ecosystem data work, expanding the scope and sophistication of our analytics to support every aspect of DAO decision making, while also serving as a protocol support mechanism that endorses native builders and attracts new builders, with the added benefit of increasing the ecosystem’s social presence. Both of the prior-listed roles around treasury management and incentives include analytics, but the data team will have an expanded scope outside of these 2 already time-intensive categories.\n\nKey priorities:\n\n* Continue building world-class dashboards and reports for delegates, investors, and DAO programs across all verticals.\n* Expand to more dapp-specific dashboards that showcase usage, traction, and ecosystem synergies in an effort to attract new protocols to Arbitrum while also supporting existing ones. These same efforts will apply to significant Orbit chain deployments.\n* Assist partners like OCL, the AF, and OpCo with analytics that track protocol upgrades, monitor the health of the network, and/or help track operational metrics. OCL, the AF, and other key stakeholders have already regularly reached out to Entropy for help with custom analytics, and we would love to continue this work.\n* Provide Entropy’s data infrastructure as a core asset for both internal DAO operations and external ecosystem engagement. Ideally, this will have its own custom Arbitrum-branded front-end rather than simply living on Dune.\n* Support institutions (e.g., TradFi managers) with data services (e.g., analytics for managers’ tokenized RWAs live on Arbitrum One) to strengthen the DAO’s relationship with them and to help establish Arbitrum One as the prioritized destination for institutions’ future initiatives.\n* Analytics around incentives and treasury management, outlined in prior sections of this proposal.\n* Handle ad hoc data needs as they arise. A concrete example of this includes our [Security Council](https://dune.com/entropy_advisors/arbitrum-dao-security-council) dashboard, which was created quickly to support the election process.\n\nBased on our experience, utilizing data services as a BD and support tool is an extremely powerful way to attract and entrench new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem. Providing these types of services is a valuable opportunity for Arbitrum to expand its brand reach and, as we’ve observed, having the ability to offer white glove treatment increases the likelihood of capturing interest from top-tier institutions and builders. Having said that, these white glow services are highly time-consuming on average, and under no circumstances do we want to divert our teams’ capacity away from facilitating initiatives that directly benefit the DAO without the certainty of conversion. Given these circumstances, there may be certain projects that are complementary to Arbitrum and are deemed as high potential for the ecosystem. In these cases, it may make sense to ramp up project-specific capacity and thus support the ecosystem both directly through ecosystem-focused efforts and indirectly through BD-related data services. In these scenarios, the Arbitrum Foundation will have the ability to waive Entropy’s exclusivity on a case-by-case basis.\n\nEntropy Data will be the connective tissue that powers smarter treasury decisions, sharper incentives, and more compelling narratives, while serving as a support mechanism for builders, institutions, and partners entering the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Special Projects\n\nEntropy Advisors will continue to act as a neutral strategic arm and flexible generalist operator for the DAO, identifying high-impact and ad hoc initiatives that fall outside traditional workstreams or require a novel approach. These are the thorny, under-owned, cross-functional, and/or politically sensitive deliverables that the DAO may struggle to tackle without a coordinated, trusted group stepping in. In many cases, the OpCo will be best suited to pick up some of this work with regard to occasional operational requirements, but given Entropy’s team composition, we may be best positioned for certain tasks based on our existing skillsets and relationships.\n\nExamples of special projects include:\n\n* Represent the Arbitrum DAO, when deemed appropriate by OCL or the AF, when dealing with external protocols that are considering deployments on the Arbitrum tech stack (similar to our involvement in the Ethena X Securitize deal to launch Converge on Orbit). Note that we’ve acted in a similar role several times throughout our initial term.\n* Help educate traditional financial institutions, typically those who reach out with interest in STEP, on the shortcomings of current tokenized RWA designs and opportunities when it comes to ecosystem integrations, and offer our time and DeFi-nativity to inform upcoming product launches in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n* Work with relevant partners to enable DAO-owned products that can diversify the DAO’s revenue streams in tandem with improving the user experience on Arbitrum.\n* Attend high-profile conferences and take on speaking opportunities to spread the Arbitrum brand. We will also continue to host “delegate days” in an effort to align key stakeholders.\n* Iterate on Arbitrum DAO’s early-stage support structure by bringing in talent and making it a more professional and cohesive experience that affords the DAO upside in the projects it helps get off the ground.\n* Miscellaneous projects as opportunities arise.\n\nWe will remain flexible in this vertical, focusing on initiatives that drive high strategic value but may lack an existing home within the DAO’s organizational structure. It may be necessary to approve ideas that Entropy will take on via a DAO vote if these initiatives require excess budgets beyond what Entropy itself can afford.\n\n### Termination Clause and Transparency Pledge\n\nThe DAO naturally retains the option to terminate this agreement through a standard forum → Snapshot process, requiring 3% of the votable token supply to vote in favor of the termination. Quarterly transparency reports will be directly shared with the Arbitrum Foundation at their request, which will have the ability to move a forum post forward with the same structure for termination. If the Snapshot proposal passes, the DAO can terminate the agreement with Entropy Advisors, effective on the last day of the month in which the Snapshot passes, effectively stopping any future payment from accruing at that moment. In this scenario, all funds earmarked (but unearned) for Entropy Advisors’ future base payments and the remaining funds of the 10M ARB set aside for incentive alignment will be returned to the DAO by the Foundation. \n\nOnce the OpCo has been sufficiently operationalized, Entropy Advisors will operate under the assumption that OpCo will be Entropy’s counterparty that will represent the DAO and act as its proxy. Moreover, we will continue sharing monthly updates with the DAO.\n\n# Overall Costs\n\n## Budget\n\nAfter reaching out to some larger delegates and key stakeholders to get feedback on how Entropy Advisors should proceed forward, it has become clear that a 2-year term mandate is desired to ensure alignment over a sufficient period of time in order to accomplish the aforementioned goals. Therefore, we are proposing to work with the Arbitrum DAO for 2 years from September 1st 2025 through August 31st 2027. We propose a base pay of $3M per year, a ~$500k per year increase versus our first term, as we have ambitions to grow the team to internalize key functions related to data, incentives, and treasury management.\n\nIn addition to our base pay, and in an effort to achieve long-term alignment with the Arbitrum ecosystem, we propose a 5M ARB allocation to Entropy Advisors that will be locked in a vesting contract with a 1-year cliff and 3-year vest. In addition to the 5M ARB allocation, 10M ARB will be set aside for the OAT to negotiate directly with Entropy Advisors on establishing short, medium, and long-term incentive mechanisms. These mechanisms may include, but not be limited to, milestone-based payments, an equity investment into Entropy Advisors, bonuses related to Entropy exceeding expectations, etc. The Arbitrum Foundation will custody this 10M ARB, and must adhere to any agreement made between the OAT and Entropy Advisors. It is also worth noting that any terms related to an equity investment may fall under NDA. Our goal is to ensure the entire Entropy Advisors team has a large incentive to see Arbitrum win, and to ensure we remain committed to Arbitrum significantly into the future. It is also our goal to ensure the Arbitrum DAO can hedge its exposure to Entropy Advisors and enjoy the benefits of its future growth.\n\nIn total, we are requesting the transfer of $6M in ARB (covering 2 years) + a 100% buffer + 15M ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation. $6M worth of ARB will be liquidated immediately upon the passing of this proposal on Tally. 5M ARB will be put into a vesting contract by the Arbitrum Foundation in accordance with the vest above and 10M ARB to remain in custody of the Foundation for the OAT / Entropy alignment mechanisms. The remainder of the funds will be returned to the DAO treasury immediately thereafter. The vesting contract cliff will begin on September 1, 2025, regardless of the timing the actual vesting contract is launched (backdated if needed).\n\nThe Entropy Team will be eligible to claim regular monthly payments of $250,000 from the Arbitrum Foundation throughout the 24-month term. Payments that have accrued can be claimed at any time. If the DAO passes a Snapshot to end its engagement with Entropy Advisors, it will be considered binding on the final day of the same month it passes, and Entropy will be ineligible to accrue any further payments.\n\nWe are nullifying the terms in our Year 1 engagement proposal that stipulate the DAO will vote on a bonus for the first year of our services, and instead replace it with this structure. The ARB allocated as a potential bonus that is in the AF’s possession related to our first engagement should be repurposed at the Foundation’s discretion to cover this engagement proposal, or be returned to the DAO treasury if not required to do so. It is also important to note that Entropy Advisors did not claim the full $205,834 monthly allotments from the first engagement proposal for the first 4 months of service, so the Arbitrum Foundation should have ~$423,336 of additional funds slated to be returned to the DAO. However, we propose allowing the Arbitrum Foundation to use these additional funds to cover a portion of Entropy’s next 2 year engagement (assuming this proposal passes) to minimize ARB sales if it wishes to do so.\n\nEntropy will be abstaining from voting on this proposal due to a clear COI. We look forward to the opportunity of continuing our work in the Arbitrum DAO over the coming years. Entropy Advisors is all-in on Arbitrum, and we look forward to winning together.\n\n## Targeted Timeline\n\n* Forum Discussion: 2 weeks\n* Snapshot Period: 1 week\n* Pre-Tally Discussion: 1 week\n* Tally: ~3 weeks\n* If passed, 2nd mandate initiated: September 1, 2025",
