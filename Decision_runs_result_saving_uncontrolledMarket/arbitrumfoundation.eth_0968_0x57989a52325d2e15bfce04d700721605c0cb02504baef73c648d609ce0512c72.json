    "summary": "The proposal requests a 200K ARB grant to boost TVL and APY on Good Entry's EzVaults to grow from $1M to $10M, with innovative features like protected perpetuals. Forum sentiment is largely positive but mixed with some concerns about spam and product readiness. Timeline analysis shows overwhelming early support for 'Against' choice, indicating skepticism or strategic reservation. Historical adjacent proposals show that similar innovation-driven proposals with minor market declines warrant caution. Market and TVL impacts are slightly negative. Overall, the recommendation is to not change the status quo, reflecting a cautious stance despite vocal community support.",
