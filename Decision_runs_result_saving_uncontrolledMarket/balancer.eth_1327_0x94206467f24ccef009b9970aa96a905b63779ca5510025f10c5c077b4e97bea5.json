        "body": "> # Summary\n>\n>\n> * This is a proposal to enable two uncapped Balancer gauges for so called \"Connector Pools\" on Arbitrum. The two connector pools will consist of **aUSDC/USDC** and **aUSDT/USDT**.\n> * Connector Pools are so called \"2-CLP\" pools that concentrate liquidity within 1bp and feed into Gyroscope's newly launched Rehype Pools. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave. In order to reduce smart contract complexity, Rehype Pools are an extension of Gyroscope's E-CLPs that relies on order routers to wrap/ unwrap aTokens on Aave. \n> * Connector Pools are a means to onboarding order routers to Rehype Pools. They reduce gas costs (swap vs (un)wraps on Aave) and require no custom logic from order routers. \n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 0.05bp basis points at pool inception. The pools will have no protocol fees at launch in order to limit the amount of incentives needed to bootstrap this pool. Each pool has a TVL target of around 100k USD. Protocol fee strategy focuses on Rehype Pools instead of these small connector pools.\n\n> # References/Useful links\n>\n>\n> * [Documentation of 2-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/2-clps)\n> * [Documentation of Rehype pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps#description-of-rehype-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n> # Protocol description\n>\n>\n>\n> * stataArbUSDT is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDT on Arbitrum. - [Aave](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n> * stataArbUSDCn is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDC on Arbitrum. - [Aave](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n\n> # Motivation\n>\n>\n>\n> Rehype pools reach new efficiency heights while staying simple and therefore safer. Rehype pools embrace a simple, modular design that doesn’t introduce new smart contract code for rehypothecation. Rehype pools thus inherit the security record of E-CLPs.\n>\n> The complexity of Rehype pools is handled in the more flexible layers of order routing and front end interface instead of in smart contracts. At the same time, they keep everything transparent on-chain and keep users in control, in contrast to common rehypothecation in TradFi.\n> \n> Connector pools faciliate Rehype Pools by making it easier for order routers to support the trade routes of Rehype Pools. It is easier in terms of operational complexity and in terms of lower operational costs (i.e., gas fees).\n\n> # Specifications\n> > ## Governance\n> >\n> >\n> >\n> > The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/915\n\n**Summary:**\n> * This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for WETH/wstETH on Polygon zkEVM.\n> * The underlying pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IAVN7mDiPt4teeuBUMqi0KJdZ2aiRWwGAxRhJU75TB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> * Lido’s wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * WETH is an ERC-20 version of ETH. - [WETH](https://weth.io/)\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n>\n> * Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n>\n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. A similar E-CLP to the one mentioned in this proposal has been recently deployed on Arbitrum. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\n> The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n**Oracles:**\n> * rateProvider0 (for WETH): 0x00\n> * rateProvider1 (for wstETH): [0x8dd590Ebb702C21A41289A0a69B0C6F74BdeCE75](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x8dd590Ebb702C21A41289A0a69B0C6F74BdeCE75)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n**Audits:**\n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports) (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n**Market History:** \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n \n**Value:** As per “Motivation”. \n\n**Contracts**\n> * WETH/wstETH E-CLP: [0xe58cD0C79CDff6252476b3445BEE1400503e0aE0](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0xe58cd0c79cdff6252476b3445bee1400503e0ae0)\n> * Childchain gauge on Polygon zkEVM: [0x8dd928a3Aa0274bBA3b42DD9F41756AaF1e78b2f](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x8dd928a3Aa0274bBA3b42DD9F41756AaF1e78b2f)\n> * Polygon zkEVM root gauge on Ethereum: [0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F)\n\n**Technical specification**\n> The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n> gauge(address): `0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F` \n> gaugeType(string): `PolygonZkEvm`",
