        "body": "Authors: Beethoven X contributors (composers and music directors)\n\nThis proposal presents an opportunity to position Balancer and Aura as the leading forces of technology on Optimism. It aims to seize the upcoming launch of Aura to leverage cross-chain Balancer boosts, restructures the network's liquidity, and propel Balancer, Beethoven X, and Aura toward increased market dominance. This proposal seeks to do so by proposing a modified protocol fee structure and core pool framework, similar to other successful Balancer deployments.\n\n**Background and Motivation**\n\nOptimism's bedrock upgrade has transformed the Superchain thesis into reality. With the impending Base Launch and the continuous development of the OP stack, we believe Optimism is poised to attract greater attention and liquidity. With the launch of Aura, these developments present an opportunity to cement the joint Balancer and Beethoven X deployment as a core technology and liquidity host on the network.\n\nSince the approval of the Beethoven X friendly fork of Balancer in November 2021, the partnership between the two protocols has flourished into a truly unique relationship. Nowhere else in DeFi has a fork become an essential SP of the original protocol. For the last year, we have recognized we are stronger when we work together, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve and building a better ecosystem along the way. If we look back, the joint Optimism deployment was the pivotal milestone in the expanding relationship between these two protocols. \n\nSince its launch in July 2022, the joint Balancer and Beethoven X Optimism deployment has demonstrated its innovative prowess, becoming the primary host of LST liquidity, amassing $60 million in TVL in April 2023, and generating approximately $370k in protocol revenue. While these metrics are indeed commendable, there is room for improvement. With the recent emergence of L2 veBAL Boost powered by LayerZero, there is the opportunity to leverage the impending launch of Aura and make considerable improvements to network market share. \n\nThis proposal seeks to optimize the current incentive structure to coincide with Aura's launch. Specifically, it aims to restructure the distribution of protocol fees to bootstrap an enhanced liquidity flywheel on the network and adopt a modified Balancer core pool model per BIP-19, supplemented by Beethoven X’s Optimism grant.\n\n**Current Protocol Fee Distribution**\n\nIn line with other Balancer deployments, the joint Balancer/Beethoven X deployment currently allocates 50% of swap fees and yield capture as protocol fees, with the remaining portion directed towards LPs. Based on initial governance approvals, both DAOs agreed to a [50](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xd281d8cad43c97814b2496270498c4396b16c0f2ce522d5bc554aae9fed4e4d7) / [50](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x2856e059b7bf581ee97ce63b36d79d85c3f27910ec5c79115de3d0d9fadc948c) split of the protocol fees as part of the joint deployment.\n\nBeethovenX's governance adopted an [additional proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x94ca4387a061af6df49ce3fefd9439e7399e7af152c59b56b370a43705eed4c1), where it committed to allocate 50% of its share of the protocol fees, converted to OP, matched with Beethoven X's OP grant, and emitted to pools as liquidity mining or gauge incentives. In certain instances when positive ROI was achieved, these incentives were directed towards Hidden Hand's OP vlAURA gauge market, but have more often been used as direct liquidity incentives.\n\nBeethoven X's grant-matching approach is a sustainable incentive model designed for long-term success. Other partnerships, such as Rocket Pool, have played a pivotal role in bootstrapping liquidity by directing their OP grants toward Optimism pools. However, the joint deployment has faced limitations in competing with the incentives provided by other protocols due to the number of incentives the joint deployment can currently emit based on the portion of protocol revenue flowing to Beethoven X.\n\n**The Value of Optimism Deployment**\n\nFrom January 1 to June 30, 2023, approximately $77.8k in BAL rewards have been emitted to OP pools through veBAL, while Balancer's revenue share directed towards the DAO treasury amounted to approximately $125.5k, resulting in a positive net cash flow. During the same period, Beethoven X incentivized pools with $56.6k worth of BEETS tokens, recycling half ($62.8k) as incentives from its share of protocol fees matched with OP.\n\nWith the anticipated launch of Aura and cross-chain veBAL boosts, Beethoven X, Balancer, and Aura will unlock more efficient means to foster liquidity growth. Historically, Aura has provided the Balancer ecosystem with an additional liquidity layer enabling efficient vote markets. As such, Beethoven X's current OP grant matching program can shift to being deployed as gauge vote incentives to direct BAL and AURA emissions to increase protocol TVL efficiently. If voting market efficiencies reduce, the incentive program can continue to emit direct liquidity mining incentives on pools. Aura has also [proposed an OP grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-28011280168279695) that would direct additional direct LP incentives or match bounties placed on any Aura voting markets with OP.\n\nBy leveraging the cross-chain veBAL boost and providing an efficient liquidity layer, combined with potential OP matching, Aura is a growth catalyst for the Balancer and Beethoven X deployment. With these additional optimizations to our incentive systems, we can ensure that our entire ecosystem substantially increases market share and revenue potential on Optimism.\n\n**Core Pool Framework**\n\nThe Balancer Core Pool Framework implemented through [BIP-19](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc), allows us to designate certain pools as \"core pools.\" Under this framework, protocol fees earned on other Balancer L2 deployments are utilized as gauge incentives for core pools on those networks, accelerating the adoption of L2s within the Balancer Ecosystem. BIP-19 was approved to collect and allocate 65% of the fees of all pools and proportionately direct them as gauge incentives to each L2's core pools to bootstrap their liquidity.\n\nGauge Framework v1, as proposed in [BIP-57](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-57-introduce-gauge-framework-v1/3604), introduced rating criteria for the Balancer community to evaluate all current and future veBAL gauges. This framework incorporates an \"overall\" factor, derived from the \"weight\" factor and \"market cap\" factor, as well as a \"revenue\" factor. It imposes a 2% cap, 10% cap, or no cap to gauges.\n\nBIPs-19 and 57 have also been applied to designate at least two 80/20 pools, Radiant and Alchemix, as uncapped core pools, in lieu of receiving ve80/20 grants\n\nThis proposal aims to adopt these frameworks for the Balancer/Beethoven X deployment on Optimism. However, we propose a modification to the distribution system: Rather than distributing incentives between core pools based on TVL, we propose incentives are distributed based on protocol fees generated by each pool, a calculation that can be efficiently derived using the [Beethoven X dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c).\n\n**Specification**\n\nThis proposal seeks to ensure that we bootstrap the launch of Aura in the most efficient way possible with two changes.\n\n1. Adopting a modified version of Balancer’s protocol fee distribution\n2. Establishing an Optimism core pool framework\n\n**Adopting Modified Version of Balancer’s Protocol Fee Distribution.**\n\nWe propose the joint Beethoven X / Balancer deployment on Optimism adopts the same 65/35 Protocol Fee distribution structure as other Balancer deployments: 65% of the fees used as incentives on the vote market for Optimism pools, and 35% goes to DAOs, with an equal split between Beethoven X and Balancer. \n\nIf approved, this action would take place as soon as possible to capitalize on Aura’s launch on the network. 65% of the fees would be utilized to buy OP and direct OP as voting incentives for core pools. The resulting action would see 65% of all protocol fees paired with OP from the Beethoven-X/Balancer OP grant, meaning a net 130% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives. \n\nThere is also the potential for further matching from Aura’s OP grant request. If Aura’s OP grant is also approved, this would see a net 260% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives for vlAura voters while the grants are active. Voters will see an increase in voting incentives that go towards pools of Optimism with the potential to increase even further with every voting cycle due to the positive flywheel effect.\n\nProtocol fees are currently collected every two weeks with all fees sent to the Beethoven X Treasury on Optimism automatically. Balancer DAOs share is then bridged to the Balancer Treasury on Mainnet. The proposal aims to keep this procedure to streamline the process of OP grant matching, with OP directed towards voting incentives for vlAura voters, or as direct Liquidity mining incentives depending on voting efficiencies. \n\n**Adapting the Core Pool Framework for Optimism**\n\nThe Optimism deployment will adhere to the Balancer Core Pool Framework that is in place for all other chains. However, we propose to add a slight change to the distribution mechanism: Instead of distributing the voting incentives based on the TVL of the pools, we propose to distribute incentives based on fees (yield and swap fees) generated over the previous two weeks. Beethoven-X has developed a [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c) that details a pool's contribution to fees and the resulting incentive distribution those pools will receive. While distributing incentives based on TVL is a good approximation, using fees as the underlying data is more accurate.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following existing pools would be designated as core pools:\n\n* Rocket Fuel (reth/eth metastable)\n* Shanghai Shakedown (wsteth/eth metastable)\n* Tri-Sonne Harmonic Crescendo (bb-so-wbtc/bb-so-wsteth/bb-so-usdc weighted pool)\n* Gyroscope ECLP (wstETH/WETH)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n* For this BIP to become active, Aura must launch on Optimism, which is planned very soon.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nVia redirecting a portion of Balancer's protocol fees to voting incentives for veBAL / vlAURA voters, the net percentage of protocol fees flowing to the Balancer DAO treasury as well as Beethoven X DAO treasury will be reduced to 17.5%.\n\nWhile this reduces potential future treasury runway, it also has the potential to bootstrap the TVL of pools that contribute considerably to revenue. Paired with a cross-chain Balancer boost, Aura’s Liquidity mining boost, incentives, possible Aura OP matching, and potentially positive ROI on voting markets, yield-bearing core pools will have the potential to see a considerable increase in TVL. To add to this, these pools are unique in that an increase in TVL directly correlates to the revenue generated.",

        "body": "## TL;DR:\n\n* Automation for core pool incentives. See code  [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/blob/main/fee_allocator/notebooks/pool_fees_and_accounting.ipynb) and results from last round [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16axBQBVNdPssQyjcIyb_4m4vOb5rKISIlrVMk7A2qjs/edit#gid=53204006).\n* Reduction of threshold to receive voting incentives for an epoch from $5000 in accumulated fees to <$1000.\n* Equal handling of incentive disbursements for Mainnet and L2s\n  * Core Pool incentives always flow to the pools that generated the fee, no handling by TVL.\n * Mainnet pays 50% of protocol fees to core pools independent of the pool fee  source which results in a 20% increased fee flow to core pool voters\n\n## Motivation\n\n[The Core Pools program](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) was first initiated in July 2022. The original proposal underwent many iterations, making it less and less reproducible. As more chains have been added, the current system has too many moving parts and manual touch-points to maintain well. This BIP seeks to consolidate learnings and the current state of the incentive program, while simultaneously introducing a new automated system for handling fee redirection.\n\n## History and Context\n\nThe Core Pools program fundamentally specifies that certain pools would have the portion of protocol fees due to veBAL holders being redirected as vote incentives. By incentivizing voters for voting on such pools through the fees generated, the proposal aligned short-term incentives with the sustainability of the protocol, creating a flywheel fueled by incentives for veBAL holders to direct BAL emissions to the most lucrative pools on Balancer.\n\nThe designation of Core Pools has generally been defined in various governance matters and through ongoing operations as pools that have at least 50% of their allocations containing yield assets with rate providers and paying protocol fees. Additionally, a number of pools have been explicitly added to the list by governance.\n\nThe degree to which fees have been directed has varied but as of [BIP-371](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-371-adjust-protocol-fee-split/4978) they stand such that L1 Core Pools & L2’s pay 50% of their collected protocol fees to support Core Pools on the chain they originate from. In the case of L1’s this has always been paid to the pool that generated the fees. In the case of L2’s various strategies were used, but often much of the available voting incentives have been allocated based on the relative TVL of the pools in each chain.\n\nAs the calculation of core pool voting incentives has so far been a manual process completed on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwUPpbYq7woVOU9vQ8EB8MY75I-1mauTLyDVwvKUDKo/edit#gid=0), the addition of “whitelisting” pools has been done by the Balancer Maxi’s prompted by a mixture of biz dev conversation and discovering new pools that were generating large enough fee-flows to work within the program.\n\nRelated to this manual calculation, the Core Pools program has so far not worked well for smaller pools. Currently, fees are only swept from pools if they amount to more than $5,000 USD. As a result, pools that generate under 5k USD per 2 week fee collection epoch often would have to wait a number of weeks or even months before enough fees accumulated to place a single voting incentive lasting 2 weeks.\n\nWork has been ongoing to automate the calculation of these flows, and the system is in good shape to start being used. This BIP introduces and specifies the new automated system for allocating core pool voting incentives, and describes:\n\n* The logic it follows\n* The relevant configurations involved and where they can be found/how changes to them are controlled.\n\n## Core Pools 2.0\n\nMost of the changes below pertain to automation. Additionally:\n\n* L2s are moving from distributing fees based on relative TVL to based on relative fee generation.\n* As with L2s, 50% of all fees generated on Mainnet will be paid into the core pools voting incentive.\n  * This simplifies/unifies the core pool process\n  * Measured over the last few rounds, this results in around 5% to 20% of the current USDC flowing directly to veBAL being redirected to vote incentives on Mainnet Core Pools).\n* Better attribution and more frequent sweeping/swapping of fees results in a more accurate fee distribution.\n\n### Fee Epoch Process:\n\n* Fees are swept and sold for USDC and BAL on a regular basis by [Mimic](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-115-balancer-smart-vaults-fee-collector/3966).\n* Every other Friday, aligning with Aura voting epochs, all available USDC is bridged to the Fee Handling multisig on Mainnet.\n* The [automation script](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/blob/main/fee_allocator/notebooks/pool_fees_and_accounting.ipynb) will run and generate csv outputs and a multisig payload in this [directory](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/tree/main/fee_allocator/allocations)\n* The payload will be loaded into the fee sweeper multisig, reviewed by the Maxis and then signed/executed.\n\n### Fee Automation:\n\n100% of all $BAL fees earned are sent to veBAL as direct incentives. The below handling pertains to remaining USDC:\n\n#### Allocation of collected protocol fees:\n\n*vote_incentive_pct* percent of the total protocol fees collected on each pool will be allocated to voting incentives daoPct percent of the total protocol fees will be sent to the DAO.\n\n*vebal_share_pct* percent of the total protocol fees will be flowed to veBAL over 2 weeks along with the BAL specified above.\n\n#### Allocation of Voting Incentives:\n\nAllocation of voting incentives occurs per chain. The following logic is applied on each chain, pertaining to the total available fees collected for voting incentives on the same chain:\n\nEach pool on the chains [Core Pools List](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools.json) will be assessed for the USD value of total fees collected over the 2 weeks preceding the fee collection epoch. Pools will be allocated a portion of the available voting incentives based on their relative fee generation.\n\nAny pool that has less than min_vote_incentive_amount in voting incentives will be excluded from the round, and its voting incentives will be distributed to the remaining core pools.\n\nThe Voting Incentive amount will be split between veBAL and vlAURA voting markets based on the auraBAL’s total capture of veBAL. If there is less than min_aura_incentive available to allocate voting incentives to AURA, all voting incentives will be shifted to either BAL or Aura in a way that tries to maintain auraBAL capture split across the entire set.\n\nVoting incentives will be placed on one or more voting incentive markets such that the allocated fees flow to the proper set of holders, and are all paid out for votes that generate emissions over the following 2 weeks. Currently Hiddenhand is integrated, but we are happy to explore additional integrations such as Paladin, VoteMarket or other emerging voting markets.\n\n#### Final Payload\n\nAll of the transactions to place incentives and pay fees to the DAO and veBAL are packaged up into a multisig payload to be used in the process above.\n\n## Specification/Configuration:\n\nThe processes above will be used for generating and adding payloads going forward. The following [initial parameters](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/protocol_fees_constants.json) will be set:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|vote_incentive_pct|%50|\n|dao_share_pct|%17.5|\n|vebal_share_pct|%32.5|\n|min_vote_incentive_amount|$500|\n|min_aura_incentive|$500|\n\nThe [Core Pools List](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools.json) will be accepted as the current configured list of core pools. Further changes will be made based on payloads approved by governance.\n\nWhile the system has the capacity to [reroute voting incentives](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools_rerouting.json) from one pool to another in case of a desire to migrate liquidity, none of this rerouting has been configured.\n\n### Future Changes to Configuration\n\nWork will continue on voting incentive automation and all changes will not be brought to governance, however basic intentions of the program and the specific parameters above are considered fixed and not to be changed without a further instruction from governance.\n\nThere are considerations around total gas cost to voting incentive//vote/claim. The min_vote_incentive_amount values seek to keep this somewhat under control.\n\nmin_vote_incentive_amount may be tuned by the Balancer Maxis up to $1000 USD without a vote in response to on-chain gas costs.\n\nmin_aura_incentive shall be maintained such that any Aura Voting Incentive always achieves well over the minimum votes required on Aura to register for a veBAL vote. The Balancer Maxis shall be granted the responsibility and authority for maintaining this value.\n\nAll changes to any of the configurations specified above should be made by a governance vote that includes a payload PR with the specific changes.",

        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512).\n\n## Summary\n\nBAL is a governance token that has been successfully used to define important parameters of the Balancer ecosystem. The community believes that there is further room for improving the tokenomics of BAL and some sort of staking/locking should be implemented. Staking of BPT has already been proposed and approved by the community in the past[[1]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/Qmcyn5zdoGQs8nbo1nFroZiG2jWb8UEFPH9Y18cga3ESCJ). The current proposal contains details of a concrete implementation of locking BPT. \n\nTo avoid reinventing the wheel and spending additional time with non-core development, Curve's tokenomics[[2]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html) seems an obvious fit for Balancer Protocol as well. It has been battle-tested with billions of dollars and attracted a thriving ecosystem around it. \n\n## **Core proposal**\n\nCurve's ve (vote-escrowed) system will be used as an all-around solution for Balancer protocol tokenomics, solving at once a few outstanding problems the Balancer ecosystem currently has:\n\n- BAL minting is not automated and the inflation schedule is not yet locked forever. This reduces predictability and trust in the overall system.\n- BAL holders do not have any direct power over how BAL liquidity mining gets distributed.\n- Lack of a mechanism for distribution of protocol level fees, which have recently been approved by governance[[3]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0xf6238d70f45f4dacfc39dd6c2d15d2505339b487bbfe014457eba1d7e4d603e3).\n\nInstead of pure BAL, BPT of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool[[4]](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56000200000000000000000014) will be locked into veBAL, similar to how CRV can be locked into veCRV. This has the big advantage of keeping BAL liquid as well as setting a precedent for other teams to do the same with their 80/20 Balancer pools. Alternatives to veBAL have been considered, like vebptBAL. The simplicity of veBAL — even though what is locked is not pure BAL — has however been the preferred option.\n\n### veBAL and governance power\n\nAll votes, onchain or on snapshot, will be done considering veBAL balances instead of BAL balances as happens today. This ensures long-term alignment as only users locking BPT will have a say in Balancer's governance.\n\nTo get veBAL, anyone will be able to lock BPT of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool for any amount of time between 1 week and 1 year. Notice this is a change from the max duration of 4 years initially proposed in [[1]](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/Qmcyn5zdoGQs8nbo1nFroZiG2jWb8UEFPH9Y18cga3ESCJ). This is proposed to allow for an eventual migration to a new governance system with a wait time of 1 year instead of 4. Of course this migration can only happen if the veBAL governance approves it.\n\nAfter locking the 80/20 BAL/ETH BPT, the user will have a non-zero balance of veBAL and will be able to help govern Balancer protocol, also benefiting from other parts of the new tokenomics system as described in more detail below.\n\n### New proposed BAL inflation schedule\n\nThe current BAL supply today (as of Jan 27th) is **47,470,000 BAL**. This includes BAL that is being vested by early stakeholders, the fundraising fund and the ecosystem fund. Please refer to the BAL launch medium post[[5]](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/bal-is-live-104ba56e1945) for more details. \n\nSince the launch of BAL, the inflation has been a constant 145,000 BAL per week. To change that and make the Balancer ecosystem more sustainable, a new inflation schedule is proposed. Every 4 years the inflation should be halved, with gradual steps every year starting one year after the launch of the new tokenomics system. This would mean a final BAL supply of about **94,000,000 BAL.** A more detailed calculation can be seen on this public spreadsheet[[6]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FY0gi596YWBOTeu_mrxhWcdF74SwKMNhmu0qJVgs0KI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThis new inflation schedule will be immutable.\n\n### Onchain Gauge System to determine Liquidity Mining distribution\n\nCurrently, liquidity mining is done via a tier system approved by the community[[7]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-balancer-v2-liquidity-mining-program/1678). The distribution is fixed for tier 1 slots (it can only be changed via governance vote) totaling 60k BAL. The remaining slots are allocated by the Liquidity Mining committee, which is part of the Partnerships subDAO[[8]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/draft-proposal-balancer-subdaos-formation/2428). BAL token holders have no direct say in which pools receive BAL from liquidity mining.\n\nIn the new system, however, all liquidity mining BAL minted will be distributed through the gauge system. Gauges are contracts that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim BAL from liquidity mining. \n\nThe amount received by each LP will depend on:\n\n- how much the pool they are providing liquidity to receives\n- what share of the pool's liquidity they have\n- the boost applied to their LP share based on how much veBAL they hold[[9]](https://resources.curve.fi/guides/boosting-your-crv-rewards#formula)\n\nEach pool receives a share of the total BAL minted every week. That share is defined by how much veBAL voted for that pool.\n\n### Gauge types\n\nThere are different gauge types that are used in the ve system, each type gets a fixed percentage of the BAL supply minted weekly. Within each gauge type there can be many gauges that share the amount of BAL sent to that gauge type. The following gauge types and weights are proposed:\n\n1. Liquidity Mining committee: 10% (14,500 BAL)\n2. veBAL: 10% (14,500 BAL)\n3. Ethereum mainnet pools: 56% (81,200 BAL)\n4. Polygon pools: 17% (24,650 BAL)\n5. Arbitrum pools: 7% (10,150 BAL)\n\nNew gauge types can be added and the weights/percentages of all gauge types can be changed by governance. These changes are however not expected to happen frequently. \n\nGauge type 1) is an allowance for the Liquidity Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from receiving it).\n\nGauge type 2) is BAL that will be distributed to veBAL holders, similarly to LM that is distributed today to LPs of the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. It is meant to keep locking 80/20 BPT attractive as it helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent loss risk of LPing. \n\nGauges 3, 4 and 5 will be LM that is distributed to mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum according to the veBAL voting power each pool gauge receives from veBAL holders.\n\n### Initial gauges\n\nIn order to avoid the governance overhead of voting on adding dozens of initial gauges, all pools that will be receiving liquidity mining at the moment of system activation will be allowlisted. This however does NOT mean that they will have an initial percentage of LM. This will be defined by veBAL voting power.\n\n### Protocol revenue distribution\n\n75% of protocol revenues collected by the protocol fee collector[[10]](https://docs.balancer.fi/getting-started/faqs/fees) will be distributed to veBAL holders. The other 25% of the fees will be kept by the DAO treasury as a reserve. This has been suggested by many thought leaders like Hasu, on his New Mental Model for DeFi Treasuries[[11]](https://uncommoncore.co/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries/). \n\nGiven Balancer protocol is permissionless and meant to have thousands of pools, fees are going to be collected in potentially thousands of different tokens. Some type of consolidation will be necessary for the fees to be claimable by veBAL holders in a meaningful, gas-efficient way. The fee consolidation prior to distribution will initially be handled by the treasury subDAO, but should be replaced in the near future by a fully decentralized smart contract implementation, akin to Curve's burner contracts[[12]](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-fees.html).\n\n### Upgrading the system\n\nLike with Curve, the system will not be upgradeable. In case the veBAL governance decides for a new system, the way to implement it would be to abandon the current system and direct minted BAL to the new system. This can only be done with a 1-year time delay, which ensures that anyone locking BPT for the longest duration possible will have the opportunity to withdraw their BPT before the minter points elsewhere.\n\nThe inflation schedule however will NOT be upgradeable and will be fixed forever.\n\n### Benefits\n\nBeyond increasing the overall predictability of Balancer Protocol and the BAL governance token as mentioned above, there are many other benefits worth mentioning: \n\n- **Long-term alignment.** By locking BPT, token holders will be encouraged to support Balancer over the long-term instead of speculating short-term.\n- **Plug&play compatibility with Curve's ecosystem.** Curve has achieved tremendous success with a thriving ecosystem built around their ve tokenomics. By using the same system we make it trivial for teams like Yearn, Element, Convex and so many others to become part of Balancer's ecosystem too.\n- **Developer time/effort saved for core Balancer work.** Tokenomics is super important but it is not what makes Balancer (or any other protocol for that matter) unique: precious development time should be focused on pool primitives and making Balancer easier to integrate with. Only this will help Balancer achieve the vision of becoming the leading liquidity platform for others to build on top.\n- **Motivation for other DAOs to take a position in Balancer beyond just token-swaps.** It has become common for DAOs and protocols to purchase CRV in the open market to make sure they have a say in the Curve Wars. By having protocols aligned with Balancer longer term we expect utility and usage of Balancer to increase as well.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Launching our own staking contracts (which are ready and audited but don't solve all the problems that this proposal does).\n- Using mStable rewards distributor or a variation of it.\n- Keeping status-quo.\n\n## **Risk assessment/mitigation**\n\n1. **Immutability of the system will likely be a problem at some point in the distant future:** It's impossible to be at the same time predictable and upgradeable, so the trade-off chosen was that the system itself cannot be changed, but veBAL governance can choose to direct BAL inflation to a new system with a minimum 1-year delay. This is not expected to happen any time soon, but as things change hyper fast in this space, this system will likely not be the best option in say 5 years from now.\n2. **Platforms built on top (like Convex on Curve) can take over control with central points of failure.** We expect veBAL governance to consider single point of failures for projects that apply to have their smart contracts be allowlisted for locking BPT. Ideally only projects which let token holders vote directly with their voting power (instead of delegating all their power to a multisig) will be approved.  \n\n## Implementation\n\nThe main goal of the implementation is to change as little as possible from the battle-tested original Curve implementation. There could be some minor necessary technical changes that are necessary to adapt it to Balancer. The essence of this proposal or the parameters laid out however should not be changed.\n\n## **Voting**\n\nThis proposal will be posted on the forum for 1 week prior to voting. Voting will then be open on Snapshot for three days. This vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote on the Proposal by selecting “Yes, let's do it” or “No, this is not the way”.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed with feedback and suggestions, also thank you to Curve for having created this great tokenomics system and also to the Yearn community[[13]](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/yip-65-evolving-yfi-tokenomics/11994) for inspiration for this proposal!\n\nI'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts and if you think anything proposed can be improved.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

        "author": "0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3",
        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allocate-up-to-2mm-in-bal-to-secure-a-bal-reactor/3124)\n\n**Authors** - BLABS Business Development (@curtis, @Jared_Balancer and @alan1) + @solarcurve \n\n# Proposal:\n\nApprove a “dry powder” allocation of up to $2MM BAL for Tokemak bribe acquisition in connection with BLABS biz dev efforts to grow integrations with Tokemak\n\n## What is Tokemak?\n\nTokemak can be thought of as a generalized liquidity layer that sits above DEXEs. Users can both LP and direct where the liquidity will go via TOKE voting.\n\nTokemak has two types of reactors - reactors can just be thought of as a place users can single side stake their assets to earn yield, then the assets are directed via TOKE voters to determine its pair(s). There are pair reactors, those can be thought of as the assets that are generally paired with protocol tokens - being ETH/USDC/DAI/FEI/etc. Then there's the token reactors, which are voted on and added during a \"CoRE'' vote - namely SUSHI/FOX/FXS/etc.\n\nUp to this point TOKE has been distributed via LM incentives for their toke/eth pairs on Uni and Sushi. As well as from staking TOKE to reactors to incentivize Liquidity Direction (and some token swaps).\n\nThe ideal future state for Tokemak is most if not all TOKE is being vied for by AMMs/other protocols to direct liquidity towards their token or platform while Tokemak controls a large bag of protocol owned assets that are earning fees and being utilized to stand up other protocols liquidity.\n\n## Summary\n\nTokemak currently provides options for four different DEXes users can direct their liquidity - Uniswap, Sushiswap, Curve and Balancer. Of the four, Balancer is by far the lowest performing. For reference:\n\n* FXS Reactor\n  * $514k/$175.2MM directed towards Balancer (0.29%)\n* ALCX Reactor\n  * $709.80/$32.1MM directed towards Balancer (0.002%)\n* FOX Reactor\n  * $0/$22.2MM directed towards Balancer (0%)\n\nAs of writing this proposal Tokemak controls $905MM worth of assets that TOKE holders are directing to the above mentioned DEXEs. Balancer is currently commanding less than $1MM of that.\n\nEvery 5-6 months a new CoRE vote goes live to determine the next round of projects that will launch their own reactors. As of writing this piece this is by far the lowest cost barrier to entry for a CoRE vote to date. The last CoRE vote reached a peak of ~$0.75/vote, [while the highest bribe on Hidden Hand is commanding just ~$0.07/vote](https://hiddenhand.finance/tokemak).\n\nReactors provide several benefits, namely those being\n\n* Ability to stake a protocol’s assets to farm TOKE, which can then be staked to direct liquidity to Balancer.\n* Opens the doors for a token swap with Tokemak to allow Balancer to kickstart Liquidity Directing, currently the best deal on this is FXS where one TOKE can direct up to $114 of FXS\n* Makes all future partnerships and integrations infinitely easier due to the Balancer community showing some support for Tokemak\n* Pending the launch of the reactor, the reactor could potentially be prewired to deploy to gauges to veBAL and further incentivize a TOKE/ETH 80/20 pool (Liquidity is deployed in cycles). Attracting further liquidity for TOKE/ETH providers away from Sushi/Uni.\n\n## Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nThe below Cost-Benefit Analysis assumes 10% TVL utilization at 30 bps and a $4MM token swap is performed with Tokemak. This does not include if any BAL was staked in the Balancer Reactor. The top row shows different scenarios based on a WACC varying from 10%-20% for BAL. As can be seen from the Net Cost Benefit section, this would result in a positive $1.46MM-$1.66M benefit to Balancer, as well as $35.26MM in TVL captured.\n\n||10%|15%|20%|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Bribe Cost|$2.2MM|$2.3MM|$2.4MM|\n|Swap Amount|$4MM|$4MM|$4MM|\n|TVL Captured|$35.26MM|$35.26MM|$35.26MM|\n|Annualized Fee Revenue|$3.86MM|$3.86MM|$3.86MM|\n|Net Cost Benefit|$1.66MM|$1.56MM|$1.46MM|\n\n**TVL captured is found by utilizing the info in the FXS reactor, where 1 TOKE = $114 of liquidity available to be directed. 1 Toke = ~$13*\n\nIt is also worth noting that TOKE has shown only a 0.14 correlation with ETH while BAL has shown a 0.50 correlation with ETH.[*](https://cryptowat.ch/correlations) This effectively acts as a way for the Balancer Treasury to diversify out of assets directly correlated with ETH while simultaneously providing the benefits listed above.\n\n# Plan of Action\n\n## Tiered Bribe Deployment\n\nThe average cost for one TOKE via bribing last CoRE vote was ~$0.75, each TOKE equals six votes. To qualify for a Reactor last CoRE vote, 12 million votes were required. As of writing this proposal only one protocol has deployed any bribes and that is LUNA, who have deployed ~$257K worth of bribes and accrued ~4.4MM votes. This is far less than $0.75/TOKE.\n\nWhat we propose is instead to send out tiered bribe amounts, starting at $0.35/TOKE and scaling to $1/TOKE utilizing $2MM of BAL to bribe with.\n\n## Reactor Farming + Potential Token Swap + Biz Dev Efforts\n\nAs illustrated in the above Cost-Benefit analysis, securing the BAL reactor + token swap would lead to a net gain in all scenarios plus the additional benefit of TVL captured.\n\nWe propose that after the bribing period Balancer engages in a Token Swap with Tokemak to seed the initial reactor and allow for Balancer to start directing TVL to it’s platform. Currently the best deal is FXS, however we can deliberate on that post CoRE vote.\n\nThis is also part of a holistic discussion that the biz dev team is working on with Tokemak, which includes:\n\n1. Developing default 80/20 pools for deployment on each reactor, which will help differentiate Balancer from other DEXs + raise awareness on their benefits for LPs\n2. Working with Tokemak to explore veBAL program as an alt to veCRV on Toke/WETH\n3. Discussing boosted pools and stable pools as an option for their exchange assets to increase capital efficiency when retained in the PCV account\n4. Balancer reactor as a means to acquire TOKE for Balancer as an LD\n\nBLABS Biz Dev believes that Balancer is in a unique position to compete with LDs globally on Tokemak to acquire TVL for our long term growth. The CBA proves that under conservative assumptions. Tokemak is heavily interested in this as well (for their growth), but finds it even more interesting if it helps bootstrap the flywheel for their involvement in veBAL. There are a number of synergies to be had here with both assets serving as productive for Tokeamk and Balancer.\n\n## Targeted veBAL Education\n\nAs a way to dissuade Hidden Hand users from instantly dumping the BAL, run an educational campaign on the value of veBAL. This could come in the form of an AMA with the Tokemak/Redacted communities and/or targeted Twitter Threads.\n\n# Risks\n\n* Bribe is insufficient and BAL used is lost, this is highly unlikely considering the current bribe market and protocols involved. For additional context all Tokemak voters are highly aware of Hidden Hand and utilize it to auto deploy their votes. Most voters have not delegated as they are waiting to see how much will be deployed to Hidden Hand.\n* Smart contract risk - Hidden Hand exploited during the bribe period, Tokemak exploited. However this is also highly unlikely and is a necessary risk when deploying funds anywhere in DeFi.\n* Risk can also be mitigated by purchasing Insurance cover via InsurAce (https://app.insurace.io/Insurance/BuyCovers)\n* Both projects have been audited multiple times ([Tokemak Audits](https://docs.tokemak.xyz/protocol-information/network-security), [Hidden Hand Audits](https://redacted-cartel.gitbook.io/redacted/additional-materials/security-measures))\n\n# Specification\n\nIf approved, $2M BAL at the prevailing market price when the vote ends (~155k BAL at time of writing) will be sent from the DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` to the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`",

        "body": "### Summary:\n\nThis Forum post requests 3 gauges for pools that introduce our new graviAURA wrapper, that should each be run under a separate snapshot:\n\n[**AURA/ETH/graviAURA (33/33/33)**](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xa3283e3470d3cd1f18c074e3f2d3965f6d62fff2000100000000000000000267)\n\nTo support deeper AURA liquidity for traders seeking to buy/deposit into graviAURA.\n\n[**auraBAL/ETH/graviAURA (33/33/33)**](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x0578292cb20a443ba1cde459c985ce14ca2bdee5000100000000000000000269)\n\nTo support both auraBAL and graviAURA liquidity and utility and to provide swapping auraBAL with industry standard routing over ETH.\n\n[**BADGER/graviAURA (80/20)**](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x1ee71e1ed744ae6d4058f5c7797c2e583dbfb095000200000000000000000268)\n\nTo drive value to BADGER\n\n\n\nHere is the multisig ticket around seeding initial liquidity in these pools:<https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-multisig/issues/580>\n\n ### Governance Process Request:\nAs this is the first gauge vote that AURA voters can vote on.  BadgerDAO requests that the snapshot for these gauges be extended to last 5 to 7 days in length in order to give the parties involved time to educate their user-bases about how to engage in this governance.\n\n### References/Useful links:\n\nBadger Website<https://badger.com/gravity>\n\nAura Website:<https://www.aura.finance>\n\nBadger Documentation<https://docs.badger.com>\n\nAura Documentation:<https://docs.aura.finance/>\n\nBadger Github Page<https://github.com/Badger-Finance/vested-aura>\n\nBadger Community<https://discord.gg/bfcYzbqeKC>\n\nGovernance Forum:<https://forum.badger.finance>\n\nGovernance Snapshot:<https://snapshot.org/#/badgerdao.eth>\n\n### Protocol Description:\n\n[BadgerDAO](https://www.badger.com) is launching a new set of products focused on ve ecosystems under a new Product Division called [Gravity](https://www.badger.com/gravity). The first Gravity product is[graviAURA](https://www.badger.com/graviaura).\n\n![](upload://6DVS6GLh2AaOhbGY2c9kjBxm7Yq.jpeg)\n\ngraviAURA is a wrapped vlAURA token with bribe harvesting features similar to[bveCVX](https://www.badger.com/products/bvecvx), Badger’s liquid vlCVX token, which has been live and managing upwards of 2m CVX/vlCVX for the past 9 months. bveCVX is a well established DeFi product, with a 9 month history of successfully managing locking, unlocking, liquidity and orderly withdrawals. The new graviAURA product is a fork of bveCVX, extended with new balancer specific features designed to allow DAOs and other token based projects and communities to create and sustain liquidity. This feature can be described in one sentence as follows:\n\n__The vote weight from graviAURA tokens in a Balancer pool with a gauge is used to vote for the pool the tokens are in.__\n\nThis solves the free rider problem. By including graviAURA in a pool, all depositors in said pool are voting for it equally. You cannot siphon yield from the pool by depositing and not voting. graviAURA automates locking of tokens, locking on a weekly cadence. Deposited tokens, as well as any unlocked tokens from a given week, can be withdrawn until the next lock. Additionally, gauges will provide limited liquidity when there is no AURA available for withdrawal.\n\n\n### Motivation:\n\ngraviAURA is designed to help DAO’s create liquidity. Part of the bootstrapping plan for graviAURA involves supporting an ecosystem pool for at least the first 3 months. We would like to launch the ecosystem pools, as well as a BADGER pool, as our first graviAURA gauges.\n\nWe expect each of these pools to maintain a base natural yield even without external voting, due to the fixed weight of graviAURA(and hence underlying vlAURA) in each of the pools that will consistently vote for them. Note that some external driver will be required to bootstrap pools with initial self-voting capital or incentivize an increase in the size of the pool.\n\n  \n\n\nAs soon as these gauges are up, BADGER will make the following changes to our voting and farming strategies around balancer:\n\n- All free votes controlled by the BadgerDAO Treasury will initially be split between these 3 pools.\n- All POL farming BAL will be moved from the BADGER/WBTC pool to the BADGER/graviAURA pool. (assuming all 3 gauges pass)\n- Any fucoolture bribes will be directed only to graviAURA pools, and if possible offered on an Aura focused bribe market.\n\n\n\n### Specifications:\n\n**Governance:**  \nBadgerDAO has a hierarchy of different multisig accounts that handle operations within the DAO. These have specific use cases and are outlined in detail in the repo linked here:[Badger Multisigs.](https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-multisig/)The highest risk operations are controlled by a timelock address which needs to be triggered and has a 2 day time delay to perform any actions.\n\nThe Badger Multisig maintains governance over the contract, and can redelegate the votes to a new EOA should the wallet be compromised. The potential risk of this centralized element of the system is therefore the misdirection of all graviAURA votes for 1 voting round.\n\n**Oracles:**\n\nBadger does not rely on any external oracles\n\n**Audits and review:**\n\nVaults 1.5 Quantstap audit:<https://github.com/Badger-Finance/badger-vaults-1.5/blob/main/security/audits/Badger%20Vaults%201.5%20-%20Quantstamp%20-%20Jan%202022.pdf>\n\nC4 contest for graviAURA strategy:<https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-06-badger-vested-aura-contest> \\[public results pending cool off period]\n\nC4 contest results for bveCVX strategy (upstream repo of graviAURA):<https://code4rena.com/reports/2021-09-bvecvx/>\n\nAdditional audit results can be found on badger.com under[Security & Audits](https://badger.com/security-and-audits).\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n\nBadger utilizes upgradeable contracts for many of the products we offer. Badger upgradeable contracts are protected by a 2 day timelock.. Our API and frontend are hosted by centralized entities, but we are developing a fully permissionless IPFS hosted access point primarily intended for strategy development.\n\n\n\n**Note:**Due to the snapshot voting element of AURA and the requirement to automatically calculate and regularly re-vote during rounds, voting is currently controlled by an EOA. This EOA sits in a secure keystore that is only accessible to 2 senior members of the Badger team and the bot which runs the voting script. Badger will work with Aura over time to decentralize snapshot voting as much as possible, and has an active workstream focused on removing centralization risks around automated snapshot based voting.\n\n\n\n### Market History:\n\nAURA, graviAURA and auraBAL are all new tokens focused on the balancer ecosystem and currently do not have significant liquidity or trading history. The purpose of these gauges is to help build that. Eth is a well known token with proven market history that is easy to find.\n\n**Badger:** Is the governance token of BadgerDAO. It has currently been trading in an 80/20 BADGER/WBTC balancer pool that can be found here: [BADGER/wBTC 80/20 Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xb460daa847c45f1c4a41cb05bfb3b51c92e41b36000200000000000000000194). The treasury maintains additional Protocol owned liquidity on both Curve and Uniswap V3, and BADGER is well traded across a number of centralized exchanges, including FTX, Binance and Coinbase.\n\n33auraBAL-33graviAURA-33WETH gauge\n\n0x2e79d6f631177f8e7f08fbd5110e893e1b1d790a",
