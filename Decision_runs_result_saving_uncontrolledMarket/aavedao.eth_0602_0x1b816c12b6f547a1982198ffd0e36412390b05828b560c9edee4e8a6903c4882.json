Assets from the v1, v2, RWA, ARC and AMM depoloyments all accumulate in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract. This proposal is the first of several intended to consolidate the various Collector Contracts and Treasury holdings.\n\nThis proposal seeks to consolidate 17 assets in the v2 Ethereum Collector Contract to USDC and redeem ammTokens for the underlying assets. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe DAO is currently accunulating over 60 assets in the v2 Collector Contract from various Aave deployments. Many of these holdings are of small economic value, are undercollateralized assets, or exhibit volatile pricing behaviour. Upon consolidating the DAOs assets into USDC, which most of the DAO's costs are denominated in, Llama intends to present the community with suggested recommendations for deploying a portion of the larger holdings.  \n\nThe AMM Liquidity Pool, v2, attracts very little capital and usage relative to other deployments. A number of the assets are frozen and, with v3 being deployed on Ethereum soon, it makes sense for the DAO to relocate this capital away from from the v2 AMM deployment. This proposal enables the following ammTokens, aAmmDAI, aAmmUSDC, aAmmUSDT, aAmmWBTC, and aAmmWETH to be redeemed periodically by calling a contract. Any actor will be able to interact with the contract via Etherscan. Llama, or anyone else, can redeem these ammTokens periodically with the underlying asset to be held within the v2 Collector Contract.\n\n# Specification\n\nThie following assets held within the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract are to be converted to USDC via swap contract.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/THUOfbb.png)\n\nUsers will be able to deposit USDC and receive the tokens mentioned in the table above, plus a small premium. The premium is expected to reimburse the cost incurred from swapping the applicable token to USDC along with associated gas costs. The methodology enables actors to support Aave in swapping one asset for another by creating an arbitrage opportunity in a decentralized manner. \n\nThe following assets are to be redeemed from the AMM deployment.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dYnreQx.png)\n\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe below outlines at a high level the flow of events this proposal will acheive:\n\n1) Redeem aTokens and ammTokens for underlying asset\n2) Deploy a Swap Contract whereby actors can deposit USDC and receive a selected token stated in the above table at the Chainlink Oracle price + premium\n3) v2 Collector Contract receives USDC\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Repay Excess CRV Debt on Ethereum v2\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - @MatthewGraham \nDated: 2022-12-08\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis publication proposes sourcing CRV for the purpose of repaying the excess debt in the CRV Reserve on the Ethereum v2 liquidity pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere are approximately 2,656,335 units of CRV of excessive debt in the Ethereum v2 CRV Reserve. At 66.35 cents per unit, a total of 1,762,478.27 USD, in the form of CRV tokens, is required to recapitalise the protocol. \n\nTo recapitalise the protocol, Llama proposes acquiring the full amount of CRV required to repay the excess debt from the existing USDC and aUSDC holdings.\n\nAave currently holds 6M units of aUSDC and 358.7k units of USDC in the Ethereum Collector Contract.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDecide on a path forward to repay the excess debt in the CRV market (currently ~$1.76M USD, dependent on CRV's token price). Llama proposes using funds held in the Aave v2 Collector Contract to repay the excess debt. As the excess debt must be paid in CRV tokens, Aave is required to acquire 2,152,041 units of CRV.\n\nThere is currently an active proposal whereby Gauntlet's insolvency fund (valued at around $280k) is to be transferred to the Economic Reserve. The insolvency fund only offsets a portion of the total cost incurred by Aave. There has been no indication of support from the community for using AAVE held within the Safety Module or from the Ecosystem Reserve to recapitalise the protocol. If Aave was to sell AAVE or stkAAVE to fund the CRV acquisition, there are two non exclusive ways of doing this:\n\n1) Auction via the shortfall event\n2) Swap contract where anyone can swap AAVE or stkAAVE for CRV\n\nOption 2 eliminates the need for negotiating any terms with a counterparty, or any counterparty needing to review contracts prior to interacting with a whitelisted contract. It is worth noting the Collector Contract holds insufficient AAVE or stkAAVE to support using AAVE <> CRV swaps. Any swap contract of this nature requires using the Economic Reserve. General discussion to date has indicated little appetite to sell AAVE to fund excessive debt.  \n\nThere has been some interest from the community to use the aCRV holding, currently 504,294 units, in the Ethereum Collector Contract to partially recapitalise the protocol. This is a partial solution  that is equivalent to just 18.98% ($334.6k) of the required CRV size needed. If the community was to use the aCRV position, a further 1,647,747 units of CRV are to be acquired.\n\nWith the launch of a new aToken, expected soon, Curve liquidity tokens can be deposited into Aave and still receive CRV rewards from the Curve gauges. Aave has the option to deploy the aCRV holding to veCRV and direct rewards towards Curve gauges that benefit the Aave ecosystem. This has the potential to become a meaningful income stream for Aave.\n\nIf Aave was to incur a delay in creating veCRV, historically this is one of the highest yielding reserves which is why CRV is the largest earning asset outside of the major stable coins. In more normal environments, over a 150 to 200 day period, the CRV reserve would generate sufficient yield to repay the excessive debt. This revenue source , CRV yield, would be lost if aCRV was used to fund repaying the excessive debt. Due to the potential upside, this publication supports retaining the aCRV holding.\n\nAs part of a broader consolidation of the Ethereum Collector Contract, approximately [$434.6k of assets](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-collector-contract-consolidation/10909) are to be swapped for USDC. This represents 24.7% of the funds required to recapitalise the protocol.\n\n### Holdings Summary\n\n| Holding          | $ Value     | % of Excessive Debt |\n| --------------   | -----------          | ------------------- |\n| aUSDC            | 6,002,226.07|              340.56      |\n| USDC             | 358,701.07  |                20.35      |\n| v2 Consolidation | 434,570.98  |           24.70      |\n| aCRV             | 330,834.02  |                18.98     |\n| Excessive Debt   | 1,762,478.27|          100       |\n\nThe table shows there is in total 385.61% more USDC relative to the excessive debt value. Do note this is only the USDC portion of the Collector Contract. There is also large DAI ($4,684,700.46) and USDT ($3,915,311.69) holdings.\n\nDue to the relative size of the USDC and the upside potential to the new aToken developed by Aave Companies, Llama suggests the community utilise the USDC and aUSDC holdings to acquire the full amount of CRV needed to recapitalise the protocol.\n\n# Specification\n\nDeploy a swap contract exchanging USDC and aUSDC for CRV. \n\nThe exchange rate is the Chainlink CRV/USD Oracle + 10 bps.\n\nCRV/USD Oracle: `0xCd627aA160A6fA45Eb793D19Ef54f5062F20f33f`\n\nEstimated Premium: 1,762,478.27 * 0.0010 = $1,762.48\nA $15,000 swap via ParaSwap at 14 gwei + depositing into the swap contract is estimated to cost $12 - $15, 10 bps is $15.\n\nA cap of $2M will be placed on swap contract. This is a defined ceiling which limits the amount of funds allocated for acquiring CRV on market. This essentially creates an upper price bound on the CRV price of 75.29 cents, which is a 13% above the current spot price, 66.35 cents. \n\nThe actor interacting with the swap contract will have the ability to select USDC and aUSDC by choosing true or false respectively.\n\nTo repay the excess debt, the repay function will be used. This function requires CRV as an input and the address the bad debt has accumulated within.\n\npool.repay(crv, total bad debt, variableInterest, Address)\n\nCRV: `ethereum:0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52`\nTotal Excessive Debt: 2,656,335 units of CRV\nAddress: `0x57e04786e231af3343562c062e0d058f25dace9e`\n\n# Next Steps\n\nDiscuss in the comment section the above proposal. A Snapshot will be presented for the two most popular options. At the time of writing, these appear to be:\n\nOption 1) Use USDC to acquire CRV\nOption 2) Use aCRV + USDC to acquire CRV\nOption 3) Do Not Recapitalise Protocol\n\nOption 3 gives the community the ability to not recapitalise the protocol.\n\nIf the Community was to prefer to sell AAVE, the preferred mechanism is a swap contract at the AAVE/CRV composite oracle rate. ie: AAVE/USD x USD/CRV >> AAVE/CRV There would be no premium offered such a swap. Let us know what you think in the comments.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: ARC - Strategic Partnership with Balancer Part #2\nstatus: Discussion\nauthor: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham\ncreated: 03-05-2022\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nAcquire 100,000 BAL tokens by deploying a Bonding Curve contract. The BAL tokens are to be held in the Reserve Factor until further details relating to Aura emerges and then the Aave community can determine if to deploy BAL to receive veBAL or auraBAL, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nDeploy a Bonding Curve to acquire an additional 100,000 BAL tokens on market at the chainlink oracle price +50 bps, for a cost $1,708,500 assuming a BAL price of $17. This is an additional purchase to the 200,000 BAL token swap being considered.\n\nAave will become one of eight token holders with 300,000 BAL tokens. All 100,000 BAL tokens are to be retained in the Reserve Factor until such time as further information on auraBAL emerges.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe original motivation for performing a token swap with Balancer can be found on the ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token, [2].\n\nWith the additional 100,000 BAL acquisition, Aave would transition from just outside the Top 50 BAL holder to inside the Top 30 holders, [3]. If an additional 75,000 BAL was acquired, totalling 375,000 BAL, then Aave would become a Top 20 holder and this includes three community wallets, one Polygon bridge pool and the main BAL liquidity pool. So really it would be more like the Top 15 holders if another 75,000 BAL was acquired.\n\nWith 300,000 BAL tokens, Aave would have the largest BAL holding of any strategic partner Balancer has partnered with. The largest strategic partnership holding to date is the 270,000 BAL position held by Tribe DAO, [4,5]. Having a larger BAL holding relative to Tribe DAO may become a competitive advantage as Tribe DAO seeks to direct TVL to Rari Fuse pools with the use of the new ERC-4626 vault, [6].\n\nWith the emergence of ERC-4626, a new type of vault, whereby Liquidity Providers (LP) can deposit their stakes BPT tokens into lending pools and earn BAL rewards whilst using staked BPT as collateral, [7]. This is particularly appealing for staked BPT holdings which have minimal Impermanent loss risk. An example would be to use the staked BPT token for the stable coin Balancer Boosted Pool which uses Aave V2 to generate yield and receives BAL rewards, [8]. Based upon the success of wstETH being listed on Aave V2, this may lead to significant Total Value Locked (TVL) growth for Aave which makes up more than 13% of Aave’s mainnet V2 market TVL, [9].\n\nHaving not yet entered in the Curve / Convex tokenomics play, Aave has an opportunity to be an early leader in the veBAL wars. With the emergence of Aura, the Aave community has a choice to determine if the 100,000 BAL to be acquired are to be deployed for veBAL or auraBAL. If Aura is like Convex, then being early and building an Aura holding is worth considering. The first step in both strategies is to acquire a sizable BAL position and as the initial 200,000 BAL is proposed to be deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year, the 100,000 BAL detailed within this proposal can be deployed into either veBAL or auraBAL contracts.\n\nThere are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using either veBAL or auraBAL to vote for BAL rewards towards pools that create TVL for Aave is a strategic advantage. If Aura evolves like Convex did, then the voter locked AURA token will have more voting influence over BAL rewards than one veBAL token. Being prepared and ready for the Aura token launch is going to position Aave to maximise the upside from its investments as rewards often favour early movers.\n\n# Implementation\n\nA Bonding Curve deployment utilising Chainlink’s BAL/USD oracle feed with a 50 bps incentive for arbitrage trades to acquire BAL on market and deposit into the contract. Aave will provide USDC to fund the Bonding Curve contract. An example of this type of transaction occurred when Tribe purchased $10M of DPI on market, [10].\n\nThe 50 bps fee is to provide an economic incentive for arbitrage traders to attain BAL on market and deposit BAL into the contract profitably by more than offsetting gas costs. This mechanism enables everyone within defi to participate and essentially crowdsources the BAL tokens on Aave’s behalf. Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor.\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer/7617/15\n[3] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[4] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888\n[5] https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x7972e1700ac30495ad936038b66055b1e6420c3de5ed1fec963abe5faa2d16a3\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023\n[7] https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626\n[8] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[9] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&marketName=proto_mainnet\n[10] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Enabling borrowing with a reasonable BorrowCap and the introduction of borrowing rewards, will lead to significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. \n\nThis proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards are expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below proposals details are applicable:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nIn support of the upcoming liquidity rewards distribution, this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap, enable borrowing and introduce a BorrowCap sufficient to create a notable deposit yield.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GSWOAxP.png)\n\nDetailed analysis can be found on the governance forum, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters are being proposed and have been reviewed by [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555/6).\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Loan To Value|58.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|67.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|SupplyCap|8.6M units|\n|Borrowing|Enabled|\n|BorrowingCap|5.2M|\n\nThe following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Slope1|4.00%|\n|Slope2|150.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |0.50%|\n|Stable Slope2 |150.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |2.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00%|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Add MKR to Ethereum v3\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@matthewgraham), ACI (@MarcZeller) and 3SE\nDated: 2023-02-18\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard MKR to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nMKR is the governance token of the Maker DAO ecosystem. MKR token holders govern the Maker Protocol, the smart contracts that power DAI. There is currently $12.71m of MKR deposited into Aave v2 on Ethereum. This proposal grants Aave the opportunity to list the governance token of the community supporting DAI which contributes $167m of TVL on the Ethereum v2 deployment.\n\nThis ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting.\n\n# Motivation\n\nMaker DAO has over $7.45B in TVL and is ranked second on Defi Llama TVL rankings. The Maker Protocol is only deployed on the Ethereum network. The stable coin DAI, provides $167m of deposits into Aave v2 on Ethereum, with over $103m of this supply being borrowed by users.\n\nThe risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlet’s original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don’t create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates.\n\nWe note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: MKR\n\nContract Address: [0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|65.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|70.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|8.50%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,500|\n|Supply Cap|6,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|$2,500,000|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n\nNote: Stable borrowing is disabled, however parameters are provided in case stable borrowing is enabled at a later date without amending any parameters.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
