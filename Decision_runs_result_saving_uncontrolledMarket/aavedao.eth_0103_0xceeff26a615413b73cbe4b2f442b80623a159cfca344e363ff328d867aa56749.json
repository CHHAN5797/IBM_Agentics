        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on Mantle\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-12-20\n---------\n## Simple summary\n\nThe current [TEMP CHECK] proposes deploying Aave V3 on Mantle Network.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMantle Network is an EVM-compatible Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum (rollup), enabling existing Ethereum contracts and tools to operate with minimal modifications. By leveraging a modular architecture, Mantle combines an optimistic rollup design with innovative data availability solutions to reduce costs while maintaining Ethereum’s security. Data availability is managed by an external DA layer, currently powered by EigenDA technology through Mantle DA, with plans to fully adopt EigenDA upon its mainnet stable launch.\n\nBy deploying on Mantle, Aave can take advantage of Mantle’s integration with Bybit products, enabling seamless access to Bybit’s 30 million active users. This creates a significant opportunity to broaden Aave’s user base and make DeFi more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nMantle currently boasts a TVL of approximately $570 million, while its flagship LST (mETH) holds a TVL of $1.85 billion. More details [here](https://defillama.com/chain/Mantle).\n\n## Benefits of deploying on Mantle\n\n- **Accessibility and Distribution**\n    \n    As Mantle is closely integrated with Bybit, Aave’s deployment on Mantle positions the protocol in front of an expanding audience.\n    \n    - This integration creates a gateway for tens of millions of potential new users to access Aave’s lending and borrowing products, making DeFi simpler and more accessible than ever before.\n- **Incentive campaigns**\n    \n    Mantle’s ongoing incentive program, Metamorphosis Season 2 offers a powerful catalyst for user engagement and liquidity growth within the ecosystem.\n    \n    - Restaking mETH into cmETH, participants earn Powder—soon to be convertible into COOK, the governance token of the mETH Protocol—and gain exposure to multiple streams of yield from staking, restaking, and additional protocol rewards. cmETH also accruing value through EigenLayer, Karak, Symbiotic and Veda points.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nThe Mantle team will provide the following, upon its deployment is confirmed:\n\n- 16M units of MNT value at around 19.2M USD valuing MNT at $1.20 ea\n- COOK points and Ethena Sats\n- $20M in USDC/USDT Supply\n- $20M in ETH Supply\n- $50M in other asset supply\n\nMore details will be shared on ARFC stage.\n\n# Specification\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Service Providers and this section will be updated at ARFC stage if proposal moves forward, after successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The ACI is not directly affiliated with Mantle and did not receive any compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Eigenlayer Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of EIGEN.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Deployment of Aave on zkSync\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-10\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThe current ARFC proposes deploying Aave V3 on zkSync to leverage the scalability and cost-efficiency of zk-Rollups. By integrating with zkSync, Aave can offer users faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum mainnet. This ARFC seeks governance approval for the deployment of an Aave V3 instance on the zkSync Era L2.\n\n## Motivation\n\nzkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zk-Rollups to batch multiple transactions off-chain and submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly enhances transaction throughput and reduces gas fees. Deposit and borrowing activities can greatly benefit from the reduced transaction costs and increased throughput offered by zkSync.\n\n### Benefits of deploying to zkSync\n\n1. **Reduce Gas Fees:** By leveraging zkSync’s efficient transaction processing, users will incur significantly lower gas fees.\n2. **Scalability:** zkSync’s high throughput will allow Aave to scale effectively, accommodating more users and transactions without compromising performance.\n3. **New Frontier & Opportunities:** This deployment will offer the Aave DAO a new frontier for growth to explore and a new avenue path for GHO, our stablecoin.\n4. **Interoperability:** Due to zkSync infrastructure, an Aave V3 deployment in the zkSync Era can benefit other Aave family products, such as Lens on a segregated layer with GHO, making it a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n1. Aave DAO commits to redistribute to Aave users via liquidity mining, GHO secondary liquidity incentives, safety module deployments, or merit programs any airdrop provided by the zkSync ecosystem.\n2.
