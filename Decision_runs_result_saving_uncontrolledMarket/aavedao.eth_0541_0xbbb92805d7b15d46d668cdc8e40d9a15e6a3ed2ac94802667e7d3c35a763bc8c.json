This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nThe below details various proposals reflecting Llama's efforts to date:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n* [ARFC MaticX Polygon v3 Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555)\n* [ARFC MaticX SupplyCap Increase Polygon v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-supplycap-increase-polygon-v3/12217/12)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nThe below chart shows the growth of MaticX supply on both Ethereum and Polygon. The recent spike in Polygon circulating supply is the result of the previous Supply Cap discussion on Aave v3 governance forum and the resulting outreach to various whales. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HzidlG1.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7KgR8XR.png)\n\nThe chart shows a clear growth since 16th February when SD rewards were initiated. There is a clear link between SD emissions on Aave v3 and MaticX growth.\n\nUsing the [Chaos Labs Updated Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-updated-supply-and-borrow-cap-methodology/11602) the MaticX Supply Cap can be increased from 17.2M units to 34.4M units. Doubling of the Supply Cap is acheived by overlooking the limitations of circulating supply and focusing on liquidity which follows the rational of the previous Supply Cap adjustment. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xW01WDf.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iMHRNbO.png)\nRatio exceeds 2.0 and thus, maximum increase in the Supply Cap is 100%.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave's exposure to MaticX over time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters have been proposed by Llama for the community to review and discuss in the comments section.\n\nTicker: MaticX\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0xfa68FB4628DFF1028CFEc22b4162FCcd0d45efb6`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6)\n\nOption 1 - 19.6M Supply Cap\nOption 2 - 29.3M Supply Cap\nOption 3 - NAE\nOption 4 - ABSTAIN\n\nOption 1 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\nOption 2 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\n\nPlease do read over the comments on the governance forum and review the vote linked [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) before casting a vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Enabling borrowing with a reasonable BorrowCap and the introduction of borrowing rewards, will lead to significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. \n\nThis proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards are expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below proposals details are applicable:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nIn support of the upcoming liquidity rewards distribution, this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap, enable borrowing and introduce a BorrowCap sufficient to create a notable deposit yield.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GSWOAxP.png)\n\nDetailed analysis can be found on the governance forum, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters are being proposed and have been reviewed by [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555/6).\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Loan To Value|58.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|67.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|SupplyCap|8.6M units|\n|Borrowing|Enabled|\n|BorrowingCap|5.2M|\n\nThe following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Slope1|4.00%|\n|Slope2|150.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |0.50%|\n|Stable Slope2 |150.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |2.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00%|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2022-12-17\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1]. As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode.\n\nThis proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens.\n\nUtilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 72.5%. At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAO’s revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost.\n\nIncreasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300%. Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility.\n\nThe breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative.\n\nThe capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3].\n\nBased upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65%. It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65%. The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZloZ51jG8cSo9pK37apk9xqwSnyM2T6WwKWEaimSNA8sVpcxxsRrQBYPf9F6DAFMzXPdlhRWwNePF_5kZrTEoZu8-rfk3CmDtTivdrrwTTQGrAe-ZoZ1to1PlsAaFfbkmQLeRdOAy0qukls3wJAXFgKgCA6TUd6jP2w6mbO4WWKOguI0RjWEQ7BkIg \"Chart\")\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the wMATIC Reserve.\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n|---|---|---|\n|Uoptimal|45%|75%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|6.1%|\n|Slope2|300%|100%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|20%|\n|Supply Cap|32.88M|47M|\n|Borrow Cap|9.23M|39.95M|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx\n[3] https://lido.fi/\n[4] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [4].",

The BB-A-USD token is to be deposited 50% directly into the Balancer gauge and 50% into Aura Finance's contract.\n\nAave DAO will earn BAL, AURA, swap fees and yield from Aave v3 via the linear pools. $3M is to be allocated to this strategy and the expected yield is around 9.3% without any boost from Aave's future veBAL holding.\n\nAave DAO will also gain the ability to create a BB-A-USD/GHO pool using BB-A-USD acquired by this proposal. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe current aethUSDC, aethDAI and aethUSDT holdings are shown below:\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.33.46.png](ipfs://bafkreifdz3sr45ieb77kmgsuzzir6ygvasygtstcd5rlyxipxd3gaz3v2u)\n The below shows the amount of DAI and USDT being migrated from Aave v2 to v3.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V2|USDT|3,119,535.51| $3,119,535.51 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V2|DAI|2,894,904.40| $2,894,904.40 |\n||||| $6,014,439.91 |\n\nThe table below shows the Aave v3 holdings after Part 2 of 3 has been implemented.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|3,155,411.89| $3,155,411.89 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|2,903,799.83| $2,903,799.83 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDC|58,173.59| $58,173.59 |\n|||||$6,117,385.31|\n\nAfter allocating $3.00M to BB-A-USD, Aave will have the following v3 holdings.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|1,655,411.89| $1,655,411.89 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|1,403,799.83| $1,403,799.83 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDC|58,173.59| $58,173.59 |\n|||||$3,117,385.31|\n\nThe aethUSDC is to remain deposited in Aave v3 and accumulate over time to facilitate any future Service Providers request for payment.\n\nAave also holds 4.5M of aUSDC on Aave v2 from Part 1 of 3 asset consolidation.\n\nWith the new [Aave v3 Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xfebb0bbf162e64fb9d0dfe186e517d84c395f016000000000000000000000502) created, gauge contract deployed and [Aura Finance integration](https://app.aura.finance/#/pool/81) complete, Aave DAO can now proceed attain the BB-A-USD and use it to earn yield. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.31.34.png](ipfs://bafkreicfefc3xsoel3sg64unqty4piq6pgzl44y6fza5i3544lh77tenvu)\n    \nAt the time of writing, routing a swap from stable coin to BB-A-USD incurs positive slippage. This is true for using all three stable coins. When setting the parameters for acquiring the BB-A-USD token, a maximum price impact of 0.20% will be used.\n\nThe methodology used for acquiring BB-A-USD will be the same approach used to acquire BB-80BAL-20WETH. \n\nIt has taken months to create a reusable approach that prevents MEV attacks and provides the ability to limit the price impact incurred when performing a swap. The methodology has been reviewed by Cowswap and Bored Ghost Developing.\n\nUpon receiving the BB-A-USD token, 50% is to be deposited into the Aura Finance contract and 50% is to be deposited directly into the Balancer gauge.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following asset holdings are to be redeemed and used for acquiring BB-A-USD.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|1,500,000| $1,500,000 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|1,500,000| $1,500,000 |\n\nDetailed execution details will be provided in the comments prior to submitting the AIP. This will enable Llama and Bored Ghost Developing to optimise the execution methodology.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). \n\n    ",

This proposal intends to increase the CRV SupplyCap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves.\n\nCapital efficiency is improved by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, increasing the Slope1 and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and significantly reduce the amount of free CRV in aggregate across the reserves.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the CRV reserve on Polygon reaching its SupplyCap, this is an ideal time to implement an upgrade that addresses the SupplyCap and Interest Rate parameters. The current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand.\n\nLlama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to the veTokenomics construct presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield. In this proposal, the Uoptimal parameter is to be increased from 45% to 70% improving the capital efficiency of the active reserves.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Kr4MgWg.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xer9PNK.png)\n\nSpecific to the Polygon v3 deployment, increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 70% will lead to an increase in the BorrowCap, which is a function of the SupplyCap and Uoptimal parameter.\n\nBorrowCap = SupplyCap * (Uoptimal + 0.1)\n\nThe new SupplyCap parameter has been prepared by Chaos Labs, 1,125.24K. This generates a new Borrow Cap of 900.19K, [2].\n\nWith borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it will become rational for profit-driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. This has been playing out with demand on Polygon v3 increasing relative to other deployments.\n\n![|602x220](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6JBjVL3HMRZ4_Bteuv2DluxmvzeGBylyijRmHcH43eLscs8ECgeDSCG6fFcYAlJxAOktJX_DQyw1ZcY5uxJQVugOBaihQFNWNydFXQFmV5QB5VdqTaNYmFobEjYyzRNGvtbzaCgHJ_POCDAgbqqX6KmwoErQYl5k-35AmQMnz9lBK4xB46HdRlEYcl8NSA)\n\n![|602x201](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QamXX3bRroYrZVEbgcF1cytYUAgrXjOXumC0-v84ZL0r0xgRRj1VkV1jBpkyyq2DOlzf3MoV_BWbe25ifn1KyldCL7Nui4Ha4sbo3O6v19ipKGdR1OOa1zWJe-2T5jQEcpYCT6eGWie2R2NcgMQ5-p9hcX0gucEw_yWdVtOaTmgHsZpapnZ5n4vpUfmnbA)\n\n![|602x201](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iedXQAPBKjRykGaxXYuvs-NvCstapd5YCB-oxREIHJMeLZydPdR_PkSBQrCAzhFRkEDignsnsnjLJcdg9PZF1obv_pfpMr5vULL9CJnPYzJbip1dGRgFAWqj8gzBBex0JaTwbB_nBS5TNgVn9dFmM951luswHEhgW6YG77Ln0DImSRoKa_ksqZR_VR-ncw)\n\nThe interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 24.66% on Polygon v3.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VEg1nYO.png)\n\nThis proposal recommends introducing a Base and increasing the Slope1 parameter to 3% and 14% respectively.  This will lead to a substantial change to the current curve. However, the current borrow rate still exceeds the borrow rate at the Uoptimal utilization point. Over time, we will be able to monitor the reserve and amend the Slope1 parameter t to optimize for utilization and revenue generation for Aave.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jpVkIiQ.png)\n\nThe Reserve Factor on Polygon v3 is to be increased from 10% to 20%, bringing it in line with all other Aave deployments.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the CRV Reserve on Polygon v2, Polygon v3, Ethereum v2 and the soon to be deployed Ethereum v3 liquidity pool.\n\nPolygon v3\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|937.70K|1,125.24K|\n|BorrowCap|640.44K|900.19K|\n|Uoptimal|45|70|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|300|\n|Reserve Factor|10|20|\n\nPolygon v2 - Frozen\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|70|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|300|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nEthereum v3 - Not yet deployed\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|NA|70|\n|Base|NA|3|\n|Slope1|NA|14|\n|Slope2|NA|300|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|20|\n\nEthereum v2 - Frozen\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|70|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|300|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x172370d5cd63279efa6d502dab29171933a610af&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v3-borrow-caps-methodology/10925\n[3] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [3].",
