Our past experiences teach us valuable lessons, enabling us to build more robust systems.\n> \n> While 80/20 pools have been associated with locking, the beauty of the DeFi space is its adaptability. Our objective is to leverage the pool structure for its inherent benefits, not merely conform to traditional use-cases. The goal is to amplify liquidity and ensure stability, rather than exploit emissions. We’re using the pool to its fullest potential to cater to the evolving needs of the market. As also noted, the proposed bribe per week represents a significant boost in Aura’s bribe market, should all bribes be channeled in here.\n> \n> The absence of a defined market cap or trading history doesn’t undermine the intrinsic value of the coin or its future adoption potential. The proposed gauge allocation, especially the 2% caps, is informed by a forward-looking strategy, ensuring that it aligns with the expected bribes and accrued yield.\n> \n> The gauge allocation is in recognition of the potential this new coin brings. Traditional metrics, like trading history, might not fully capture the inherent value and projected adoption. We’re operating in a rapidly evolving landscape; hence, a forward-looking approach is crucial. Coingecko’s preview status doesn’t reflect the groundwork and strategic partnerships that underscore this project.\n> \n> The proposal aims to push the boundaries, capitalize on new opportunities, and ensure the best outcome for the community.

        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to gather Balancer community support and approval for Solace DAO to launch and operate a new Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora chain, an EVM within the NEAR ecosystem. This newly deployed protocol will be called Holdr, with the governance token HLDR, and ultimately governed by Holdr DAO.\n\n# Abstract\n\nIf approved, this proposal will result in:\n\n- Solace DAO launching Holdr as an officially recognized Balancer Friendly Fork on Aurora\n- Balancer DAO Treasury receiving 4% of HLDR total supply\n- BAL tokenholders receiving 1% of HLDR total supply\n- Solace DAO and Balancer DAO research and co-marketing collaboration\n\n# Preface\n\nThis proposal is shared by Solace’s team and was written by Nikita Buzov (founder). Solace has received a grant of $20,000-worth of AURORA tokens from Aurora to pursue this proposal and launch a Balancer V2 friendly fork. Also, back in summer 2021, Solace DAO has also received a NEAR grant worth of $30,000 from NEAR Foundation to develop Solace, a DeFi Insurance protocol (live across Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Aurora). Therefore, Solace has been well supported and integrated within the NEAR ecosystem community, which, along with successful experience operating DeFi protocols, makes Solace team a natural partner within the Aurora’s and NEAR’s ecosystems.\n\n# Motivation\n\nBoth NEAR and Aurora ecosystems have been steadily growing and developing their unique technology. Over the years they have shown a strong commitment to innovation and user experience, developer community, as well as security! Because of this continued growth, Solace is excited to support their ecosystem and, together with Aurora, identified a need for Balancer V2 technology to become present there.\n\n# Background\n\nSolace is a DeFi insurance protocol, founded back in 2020 and first launched in 2021 on Ethereum, later expanding to Polygon, Fantom, and Aurora. Over the past years Solace team has been awarded grants from Polygon, Aave, NEAR, Celer, and Aurora, following successful completion of the specified goals. Additionally Solace DAO has been funded through a seed round in 2021 (raised $1.1M). The team has displayed over time a great track-record of shipping products, developing and setting up complex architectures, operating protocols on multiple chains. Solace’s team is currently composed of 10 people: 5 engineers, 1 UI/UX designer, 2 BD & marketing, 1 operations, 1 founder (also an engineer).\n\n# Specification\n\nSolace is set to launch Balancer V2 fork in the most current production deployment, including all the core technology. With security in mind, Solace will not make any changes or updates (unless explicitly requested by Balancer DAO, or an emergency response to a verified vulnerability is required) to the core smart contracts. This work has been complete and the contracts are live in production. I invite you to check and verify both the application and the deployed contracts following these links:\n\n- Website (access the app through the link on there): https://holdr.fi/\n- Smart contracts: [https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses](https://holdr.gitbook.io/holdr-protocol-overview/developers/deployment-addresses)\n\nPlease note that LBP UI and the Bribe market functionality are still in development, but should be completed in the following weeks, ahead of the HLDR token launch (tentatively scheduled for December'22).\n\nHoldr will also follow the exact same governance process and tokenomics design as veBAL, locking 80/20 HLDR/wNEAR BPT with a max period of 1 year to control the HLDR liquidity mining emissions across gauges.\n\n# HLDR Supply and Distribution\n\nThe total supply of HLDR will be 100,000,000 HLDR tokens and distributed through the following allocations and schedules:\n\n## 5% - Balancer\n\nA portion of the Holdr protocol should be owned by both the Balancer’s treasury and BAL holders. This would be following a standard set by a previous Balancer friendly fork, Beethoven X. We propose, in a similar fashion, that 5% of the total supply of HLDR should be allocated as follows:\n\n- 4% provided to the Balancer DAO Treasury (2y linear vesting, 6mo cliff).\n- 1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows:\n    - A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders\n    - Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible\n    - A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders, including the holders of veBAL locking their BPTs, on Ethereum\n    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL/ETH 60/40 BPT holders\n    - A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, USDC/MATIC/WETH/BAL 25/25/25/25 BPT, and BAL/ETH 80/20 BPT holders.\n\nTo achieve a more equitable distribution of the airdrop tokens, they will be distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value of the holdings. Note, any qualifying address will need to have a Holdr LP position, worth at least $100, staked in incentivized liquidity mining. A snapshot date will be announced within a month after the launch, if this vote is passes. The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined collaboratively between the Solace team and the Balancer community and the requirements outlined here are subject to small revisions.\n\n## 15% - Solace DAO\n\nThis allocation will be awarded across Solace DAO, Solace Launch DAO, and the active team members to compensate for the on-going work and to support Holdr protocol operations. The distribution will happen on a 2 year linear vesting schedule with a 6-month cliff.\n\n## 15% - Holdr DAO Treasury\n\nThe Holdr DAO will be formed overtime by the community and will inherit this treasury to govern and financially support any future developments, grants, contributor compensations, etc. Solace team’s goal over the next couple of years will be to pass on the governance as the Holdr DAO matures. This treasury will be be vesting linearly for 5 years, with a 1-year cliff.\n\n## 14.125% - Ecosystem Partners & Investors\n\nThis allocations will be utilized to effectively partner with various protocols within NEAR and Aurora ecosystems, as well as to raise some capital to finance any operational costs. Vesting will follow a linear schedule of 2 years, with a 6-month cliff, similar to the Balancer DAO and Solace DAO allocation.\n\n## 2% - HLDR Liquidity Bootstrapping\n\nThese funds will be used to seed and launch HLDR token using Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool.\n\n## 48.875% - Liquidity Mining Emissions\n\nSimilar to Balancer’s schedule, Holdr will adopt emissions halving every 4 years. The initial emissions rate will start at 150,000 HLDR/wk.\n\n# Friendly Fork Agreement\n\nIf accepted by the Governance process of both DAOs, this friendly fork will start effective immediately. There is no expiry date to the agreement; however, both DAOs can override this Friendly Fork agreement through their governance process to remove the Friendly Fork title with a one-month notice period. If such decision passes a vote, Balancer DAO will loose claim to all unvested HLDR tokens granted to their DAO Treasury.",

Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.\n\nInverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;\n\n* On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.\n* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP (currently $42.5M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Velodrome ($17.2M TVL), and soon to be DOLA/USDC and Balancer (replacing the DOLA/bb-a-USD pair that was killed due to a [disclosed bug](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1611363559685898247?s=20&t=4e6cn2cPCda1i1jWMfuWRw)).\n* Via purchase with DAI stablecoin using[ The Stabilizer](https://www.inverse.finance/swap/DAI/DOLA).\n\nDOLA is not \"algorithmic\" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.\n\n**About Coin98**\n\nCoin98 is a DeFi product builder focusing on creating and developing an ecosystem of DeFi protocols, Web3 applications, and NFTs on multiple blockchains. Our mission is to fulfill untapped demand and enhance in-demand utilities in the DeFi space, helping people to access DeFi services effortlessly. The Coin98 universe is now consolidating Coin98 Super App, Coin98 Exchange, Coin98 SpaceGate (cross-chain bridge), Coin98 Dollar (CUSD) and many more incubating initiatives.\n\nCoin98 Dollar (CUSD) is a fully-backed stablecoin that aims to become a cross-chain unit of account that fulfills the demand for cross-chain liquidity in DeFi.\n\nIn order to convert to 1 CUSD, a total of $1 worth of the collateralized assets must be sent into the CUSD Reserve smart contract. Specifically, in the initial phase, the collateral ratio to convert to 1 CUSD will be $1 worth of fiat-backed stablecoins - BUSD (on BNB Chain) and USDC (on Solana and Ethereum).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis proposal aims to add the DOLA/CUSD pool to the Balancer Gauge controller.\n\nCUSD is a stablecoin recently launched by Coin98. Coin98 has a wide range of products, including Coin98 Super App (aka Coin98 Multichain Wallet) that has 6 million users worldwide, especially popular in the Asia region, and is the best multichain wallet that supports more than 70 blockchains, including EVM and non-EVM chains.\n\nAdding a gauge to this LP will onboard Coin98 and its users to the Balancer and Aura ecosystem via CUSD stablecoin, and consequently, get them to experience all other pairs available on Balancer. This also provides a platform for Coin98 to build and release further products and integration for CUSD on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nBoth Inverse Finance DAO and Coin98 will jointly incentivize liquidity to the pool, allowing CUSD to access the already deep liquidity of DOLA.\n\nThis is a continuation of the already established partnership between Inverse Finance DAO and Coin98, with a jointly incentivised DOLA/CUSD pool already active on Thena, currently with a TVL of $2.5M and 7-day volume of $700k.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nYou can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.\n\n>1. Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n\n**About Inverse Finance**\n\nInverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.\n\n**About Coin98**\n\nThe CUSD protocol governance structure is currently managed by:\n\n0x1db6ad727ae60d7b4dbee81f79c4bcbcff8759f8 - CUSD\n\n0x6fd5991da792f09ed0ed0e9327f4c5164c66e1f3 - CUSD Mint Burn\n\nCoin98 team has been maintaining the CUSD protocol with these addresses to ensure a smooth transition toward decentralization while having proper product development progress in the initial phase.\n\nWe have plans to decentralize the CUSD governance system via C98 token in the future.\n\n>2. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\n**About Inverse Finance**\n\nInverse Finance’s new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price oracle for its WETH and stETH market. Inverse Finance's old lending market relied on both Chainlink and non ChainLink oracles, however, borrows have been disabled since June 2022 with no current plans to re-enable.\n\n**About Coin98**\n\nNo.\n\n>3. Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\n**About Inverse Finance**\n\nAs part of our renewed smart-contract review process, Inverse Finance hosted [a bug bounty contest](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-10-inverse-finance-contest/) on the Code4rena platform to conduct a comprehensive audit of our fixed rate lending protocol, FiRM. Inverse has also recently expanded its bug bounty program by [launching a vault](https://app.hats.finance/vaults) on the Hats.finance platform. FiRM contracts were also reviewed by boutique auditing firm DefiMoon, who have been our [official security partners](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/new-security-layer-a-welcome-to-the-defi-moon-team) during Q4. In addition to providing security consulting and auditing services for FiRM, DefiMoon has also played a role in our recent deployments of [FraxBP Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/66), [Aura Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/71), and [Velo Fed](https://www.inverse.finance/governance/proposals/mills/68). In the immediate aftermath of our price manipulation incident, Inverse had hired leading security firm PeckShield in Q3 to perform an audit of our renewed INV oracle, as well as our [bad debt repayment product](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/How%20Inverse%20Is%20Thinking%20Outside%20The%20Box%20on%20Frontier%20Debt%20Repayments). Their report can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LWNG08mib2GcI1WqnMt5IdFoW73QU2F8/view).\n\nThe DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).\n\n**About Coin98**\n\nSecurity has always been our top priority since the beginning of product development There for Coin98 Dollar (CUSD) had been audited by multiple organizations such as SlowMist, PeckShield & Inspex previously before launch. All audit records can be found [here](https://docs.coin98.com/audits/coin98-dollar).\n\n>4. Centralization Vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n**About Inverse Finance**\n\nWithin the DAO working groups have been formed to deliver work in specific areas. Often, these working groups will have a Multisig wallet that the DAO governance awards certain roles and limited DOLA or INV allowances in order to carry out required work. All granted privileges and allowances can be reclaimed/disabled by INV token controlled governance. These are:\n\n* Treasury Working Group (TWG): 3 of 4 Multisig with allowances giving access to Treasury funds to optimize treasury management.\n* Risk Working Group (RWG): 1 of 3 Multisig with privileges to pause actions in our (now disabled) lending market.\n* Policy Committee (PC): 5 of 8 Multisig that can change staking reward rate to INV stakers.\n* Fed Chair: 2 of 5 Multisig that can call the expansion and contraction functions (to mint/burn DOLA) on the Fed Contracts.\n\nPlease see our Multisig Wallet section of the transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/multisigs).\n\n**About Coin98**\n\nThe CUSD protocol is currently managed by the Coin98 team. We have a plan to decentralize the protocol management in the future, starting with a multi-sign approach for the contract keys managed by multiple contributor groups.\n\n>5. Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume\n\n**About Inverse Finance**\n\nInverse Finance DAO launched DOLA In February of 2021. Through the “Feds”, Inverse maintains the flexibility to adjust borrowing rates across one or even all partner lending markets in order to optimize supply and demand for DOLA and to maintain its USD peg. DOLA’s Fed mechanics have proven to be highly resilient at defending the peg, even during times of extreme stress. The DOLA-3Pool experienced 3Pool bank runs twice (on the days of oracle exploits) on April 2nd and June 16th; both times DOLA depegged for very short periods of time. Please see our graph below of DOLA’s peg YTD.\n \n![dola_1.png](ipfs://bafkreihdhgepssyr35efmncpgqr6xsytzbj6cyycyjyfbpkuzdsvpyh3lm)\n   \nCurrently, the deepest liquidity pool for DOLA stablecoin is DOLA/FRAXBP on Curve, with a TVL of $41.8m at the time of writing.\n\n**About Coin98**\n\nCoin98 launched CUSD in September 2022. CUSD is a fully-backed stablecoin that you can redeem at 1:1 ratio for the collateralized assets in the smart contract, which currently supports USDC & BUSD.\n\nCUSD has maintained a stable price with liquidity pools on multiple blockchain (Kyberswap Elastic for Ethereum, Baryon Network on BSC & Saros Finance on Solana) with no significant price change events. There was a price deviation display error on Coingecko, but it got fixed immediately.\n    \n \n![cusd.jpg](ipfs://bafkreif3nobzx4gucmcntywvbutvyy2m2ivrisqx6ipz7s6xagzqsabz6m)\n    \n\nThe DOLA/CUSD Balancer pool has just been recently established as a joint effort of Coin98 and Inverse Finance to onboard our users to the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n### Specification\n#1\nThe DAO Multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer 0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6 calling grantRole with the following arguments:\n\nrole: 0xf49d7ffb5922642adc9f29cfb52b2214e81e0b0e54e9cd1e9f70439f0011f368\n\nThis corresponds with the role for calling add_gauge on the gaugeController as seen here .\n\naccount: 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f\n\nThis allows the DAO Multisig to directly add gauges to the controller.\n\n#2\n\nThe DAO Multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at 0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75 and call performAction with the GaugeController at 0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD for the target(address) argument and using 0x3a04f900 followed by the gauge address 0xFc4541437265945F13368F9F61c19dA427D41A02 and the corresponding gauge type for the data(bytes) argument.\n\ndata(bytes) : 0x3a04f900000000000000000000000000fc4541437265945f13368f9f61c19da427d41a020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002\n\n#3\nThe DAO Multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will initiate a transaction to the Authorizer 0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6 calling renounceRole with the following arguments:\n\nrole: 0xf49d7ffb5922642adc9f29cfb52b2214e81e0b0e54e9cd1e9f70439f0011f368\n\nThis corresponds with the role for calling add_gauge on the gaugeController as seen here .\n\naccount: 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f\n\nThis removes the ability for the DAO Multisig to directly add gauges to the controller.",

Our main goal is to create a win-win scenario where all participants benefit, ultimately making yields more attractive and accessible to a broader range of users. The concept of veTokens has a proven track record within the industry. Notable projects like Curve/Convex and Balancer/Aura have effectively implemented similar models. We are confident that this approach serves as a potent mechanism for aligning the interests of both liquidity providers and Pendle token holders.\n\nOur native token EQB acts as a governance and incentivisation tool within the ecosystem. Locked EQB tokens will have governance rights in the system and will be able to vote using the protocol owned vePENDLE voting power as well as on internal proposals.\n\nBoost Pendle LP Yield: Our core idea is to align liquidity providers and $PENDLE holders together to maximize incentives for all participants.\n\n* Liquidity providers, who provide liquidity to Pendle through Equilibria, can earn boosted rewards in both $PENDLE and $EQB, even if they do not own any $PENDLE. EQB is our governance token,EQB earned can further be locked to receive a share of the protocol's revenue and to vote and earn bribes.\n\n*  $PENDLE holders, on the other hand, can convert their tokens into $ePENDLE and stake them to earn rewards in both $PENDLE and $EQB. $ePENDLE holders can also easily exit their position by swapping back to $PENDLE, providing flexibility and ease of use.\n\nVoting & Bribe:\n\n* Vote: vlEQB (locked EQB) is available on both Arbitrum and Ethereum. We enable users to vote on multi chains. The votes will be merged to control the vePENDLE Equilibria owned in Pendle's Gauge Voting system. Participating in the Gauge Voting can earn a vote reward from Pendle and potential bribe reward.\n* Bribe: Protocols who have liquidity on Pendle Finance are very keen to buy votes from Equlibria. By doing this, they can get more PENDLE emission on their liquidity. So there will be very promising bribes rewards for all the vlEQB holders. After votes on Snapshot, the bribe reward will be distributed. The voters can claim their bribes at Equilibria website.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Explain why this pool needs incentivization\nThis proposal aims to introduce a veBAL gauge for the ePENDLE/PENDL pool, with the objective of establishing substantial ePENDLE liquidity on Balancer. The inclusion of platform BAL incentives is intended to further enhance ePENDLE liquidity and maintain a more stable peg for ePENDLE. Upon approval, we anticipate actively promoting our new veBAL gauge and leveraging EQB's bribe feature to facilitate incentivization, thereby contributing to the development of the Balancer bribe market narrative. \nThe Equilibria Team remains committed to being a prominent supporter of Balancer technology and a catalyst for BAL emissions through our bribe incentives. Once the ePENDLE/PENDLE pool is eligible for BAL rewards, our bribe feature and strategy will be instrumental in encouraging trading, incentivizing liquidity providers, and fostering LP farming activities on the Balancer platform.\n\n**Specifications:**\n Equilibria Finance has managed to lock approximately 7.8 million PENDLE tokens on our platform, which account for 24% of the total vePENDLE supply. It has been expanding across multiple chains -Ethereum,Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Optimism. This expansion now achieves $64M TVL, and offers diverse opportunities to our users.\n\nYou can view analytics for Equilibria on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official website](https://equilibria.fi/), [official docs](https://docs.equilibria.fi/) and our [DUNE](https://dune.com/lxx1233/equilibria-finance) pages.\n1. **Governance:**  Information on governance [Overview - ](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)[Equilibria votes and snapshots](https://docs.equilibria.fi/mechanism/vote-and-bribes):\n\nProtocols who have liquidity on Pendle Finance, their Pendle emission are determined by votes which investors could use vlEQB to vote at Equilibria snapshot either at Arbitrum or Ethereum, you can visit and vote at Equilibria Snapshot [Epoch #xx] Weekly Pendle Gauge Vote. The official snapshot page is: https://snapshot.org/#/equilibriafi.eth\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?No.\n\n3. **Audits:** \nAt Equilibria, security is our top priority. Our experienced team, with backgrounds at renowned companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Airbnb, has meticulously designed robust security measures. We have undergone rigorous auditing by Peckshield and WatchPug, with detailed reports available at [here](https://docs.equilibria.fi/security-and-risk/audits)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Equilibria employs a 3/5 multi-signature control mechanism and utilize timelock contracts to provide enhanced security and peace of mind for our users.\n\n5. **Market History:** Equilibria launched In June of 2023. Through the ePendle Pool and incentives, Equilibria maintains the flexibility to adjust incentives on ePendle pool and provide more strategy in ePendle pool to boosting the yield in order to optimize supply and demand for ePendle and to maintain its peg to PENDLE. Equilibria’s strategy and mechanics have proven to be resilient at defending the [peg](https://twitter.com/equilibriafi/status/1684563705693097984).

The proposed ePENDLE/PENDLE+ pool strives to become a primary liquidity hub for both tokens, thereby bolstering market stability and depth on Balancer. We will promote this pool and provide bribe rewards to attract more liquidity.**\n\n**Specifications:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xc40F4ABc616Ab3136A002A667A7830F3F7dEC5FA`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
