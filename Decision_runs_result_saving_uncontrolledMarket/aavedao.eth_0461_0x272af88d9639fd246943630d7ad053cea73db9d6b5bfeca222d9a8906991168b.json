The proposal aims to allocate funds to the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) treasury for the next six months, enabling us to actively engage in the Aave ecosystem and contribute to its growth and improvement.\n\n## Abstract:\nif this proposal were to be approved by governance, a stream of the allocated budget would be started to the ACI treasury wallet. It will be used to cover various aspects of the ACI's involvement in the Aave community, including team compensation, community engagement, research and development, infrastructure costs & tooling subscriptions, marketing, and communications.\n\n## Motivation:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been a dedicated contributor to the Aave ecosystem. The 6-Month Budget Proposal aims to secure the necessary resources to continue the ACI's work, ensuring that we can maintain our level of commitment and contribution to the Aave ecosystem. For more details about the ACI proposal, please refers to the [TEMP CHECK version of the current proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344)\n\n## Specification:\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with `treasury.aavechan.eth` (0x57ab7ee15cE5ECacB1aB84EE42D5A9d0d8112922) as the recipient. This will allow the ACI to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 250,000 aUSDT.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is an independent organization focused on contributing to the Aave ecosystem. This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Acquire AURA \nauthor: @TokenLogic & @MarcZeller (ACI)\ncreated: 2023-08-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes Aave DAO acquire 443,674 AURA from Olympus DAO for 420,159.28 units of DAI.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the next few months the veBAL and vlAURA being used to support GHO pools will reduce as voters shift there focus away from GHO. The initial commit from the Aura Finance team was 400,000 units of vlAURA for an initial 3 month duration.\n\nThis proposal seeks to replace the support from Aura Finance by acquiring 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO. Olympus DAO is reducing there AURA exposure due to change in the Olympus DAO roadmap which is detailed [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3756-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus) and [her](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3967-tap29-aura-solicitation-to-bid).\n\nBased upon the research presented in this [Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682), which details impact AIP-42 by Aura Finance, the most efficient way for Aave DAO to bootstrap GHO is via vlAURA relative to veBAL. \n\nOlympus DAO seeks payment in DAI, at an exchange rate of 0.9470 DAI per unit of AURA. The amount of AURA is 443,674 with a total cost to Aave DAO of 420,159.28 units of DAI. Aave DAO currently holds [2.873M](https://etherscan.io/token/0x028171bca77440897b824ca71d1c56cac55b68a3?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) units of aDAI on Aave v2.\n\n**Olympus DAO is conducting an open forum auction over 3 day period, bids are placed relative to the spot price derived from the AURA/wETH pool on Balancer v2.\n\nThe USD price will be updated within this proposal progressively over the bidding period. Do note, Aave DAO's governance process duration exceeds that of Olympus DAO's which means Aave DAO's voting occurs afterwards and ultimately determines if/when the OTC swap will occur**\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will achieve the following:\n\n* Redeem 420,159.28 units aDAI from Aave v2\n* Exchange 420,159.28 units of DAI for 443,674 units of AURA with Olympus DAO\n\nFor reference, Olympus DAO AURA Holding Address: `0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B`\n\nThe contract shall be developed in collaboration with @MarcZeller and deployed by the ACI team.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem. TokenLogic seeks to become an Aave DAO Service Provider.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This will enable AGD contributors and grant recipients to be rewarded with GHO, and any other asset held in the AGD's multisig. \n\nWith GHO trading beneath $1, the Aave DAO can acquire GHO on market which will help support the peg and then use the GHO to provide funding to AGD. Distributing GHO  will promote the usage and adoption of GHO.\n\nThe Aave DAO is sending a strong signal of support for GHO by using it to reward contributors to the community. Over time, we hope all AGD and Service Provider expenses are settled in GHO.\n\nThis proposal will likely be implemented around the time the ARFC to increase [GHO's interest rate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-gho-borrow-rate/14612) is to be implemented and the issue flagged [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temporarily-pausing-gho-integration-in-aave/14626) has been resolved. Both proposals are expected to help support the GHO peg.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following assets from the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO. \n\n* 228,000 units of aEthUSDC\n* 150,000 units of aEthUSDT\n\nThe DAI allowance is to be cancelled.\n\nA GHO allowance is to be created to the value of 385,000 units (estimation of GHO acquired from swaps).\n\nThe AGD mulisig `eth:0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0` will be able to use the allowance function on `0xE4621DfD503A533f42bB5a45162eA3e5233Acd5F` to claim the GHO. \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

The publication supports redeeming the assets shown below from v2 Avalanche and deposit them in v3 Avalanche. \n\n \n![Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 09.23.18.png](ipfs://bafkreiggndqcywgealtinsz7yu3s6e7fmpkcla6r5r6fyqnsjd6jrxt6oi)\n    \n\nThe deposit rates on v3 are great than v2 and there is also wAVAX incentives being distributed across v3.\n\nIf required, this proposal is to be implemented via multiple AIPs to ensure there is sufficient Supply Cap capacity to enable funds to be deposited into v3. \n\nDo note, the borrow rate on v2 will increase in response to migrating funds from v2.  \n\nTransferring the DAOs funds from v2 to v3 can be performed via the migration tool developed by @bgdlabs. There are also smaller holdings, example: wAVAX, that can be deposited to earn yield. This proposal will result in ~8.3% of the TVL on v2 being migrated to v3. \n\nFor reference, the Aave Avalanche v2 Treasury: [`0x5ba7fd868c40c16f7aDfAe6CF87121E13FC2F7a0`](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x5ba7fd868c40c16f7aDfAe6CF87121E13FC2F7a0)\n\n# Specification\n\nPerform the following:\n\n* Transfer funds from v2 to v3 via migration tool (can be one or several AIPs, subj. Supply Cap restrictions)\n* Deposit passively held assets into v3 \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The previous Supply Cap increase from 17.2M to 29.3M is filling rapidly. This publication seeks to increase the Supply Cap in effort to enable MaticX deposit growth to continue. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nWith Liquidity Mining (LM) ongoing, MaticX deposit rewards (SD) and wMATIC borrowing rewards (stMATIC & MaticX), it is important that Aave DAO ensures there is adequate capacity to enable the many yield maximising products built on Aave v3 to grow. \n\nWith an abundance of wMATIC deposits and LM ongoing, we are experiencing exception MaticX deposit growth. \n\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.19.48.png](ipfs://bafkreihzi2cmpwhakz3wx2c63vtmxrhnliqfndk2ufnhwjpmbtlboyceje)\n    \n\nTo facilitate the continued growth of MaticX, this proposal seeks to increase the Supply Cap to 75% of supply on Polygon. This is the maximum counterparty risk Aave DAO has voted to support.\n\nCurrent MaticX supply on Polygon is [50,559,800 units](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6). Therefore the newly proposed Supply Cap is 38,000,000 units (rounded up). The author expects a whale to be moving liquidity from Ethereum to Polygon, if this was to occur in the next day or so, then the proposed Supply Cap will be raised, with support from one risk service provider.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) the preferred path forward is to implement several upgrades to gradually increase Aave's MaticX exposure over time. \n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: MaticX\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0xfa68FB4628DFF1028CFEc22b4162FCcd0d45efb6`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6)\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|29.3M units|38.0M units|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "This proposal seeks to onboard TokenLogic as a Service Provider to Aave DAO for a 6-month period, funded through a GHO stream. The voting timeline shows unanimous early support with strong voting power backing the 'YAE' choice. Forum discussion reveals concerns around internal alignment and budget clarity, leading to the eventual cancellation of the proposal and plans for revision. Similar past proposals aimed to manage treasury allowances and acquire assets with strong community backing and positive outcomes.",

      "TokenLogic has contributed significantly to Aave over the past 6 months and formalizing their role as a service provider supports continued contributions.",
