        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to:\n\n(1) Reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for sixteen (16) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n(2) Increase Reserve Factors for all collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reducing the potential risks associated with V2 markets and promoting migration to V3, we suggest a phased wind-down of the **frozen** V2 markets. The following proposal is part of a series of proposals to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets.\n\nThe previous iteration of proposals:\n\n- [[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.6.23](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-6-23/13789)\n- [[ARFC] Chaos Labs - Incremental Reserve Factor Updates - Aave V2 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766)\n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction.\n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) - This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations.\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% and the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n• “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 35% | 1,580 | 5 |\n| BAT | 52% | 38% | 750 | 3 |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 250 | 3 |\n| DPI | 42% | 22% | 80 | 2 |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 500 | 4 |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 1,500 | 4 |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 1,160 | 3 |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 2,440 | 10 |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 56 | 1 |\n| UNI | 77% | 57% | 500 | 9 |\n| SNX | 59% | 39% | 650 | 10 |\n| MKR | 64% | 44% | 140 | 5 |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 45 | 2 |\n\n• “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 45% | 1,120 | 3 |\n| BAT | 52% | 42% | 80 | 2 |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 250 | 3 |\n| DPI | 42% | 32% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 500 | 4 |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 1,500 | 4 |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 1,160 | 3 |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 2,440 | 10 |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 56 | 1 |\n| UNI | 77% | 67% | 290 | 6 |\n| SNX | 59% | 49% | 85 | 3 |\n| MKR | 64% | 54% | 16 | 2 |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 45 | 2 |\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Aggressive | $10,100 | 58 |\n| Moderate | $8,580 | 43 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### LTV Decrease\n\nFor assets where the LTV is not 0, we recommend maintaining the same buffer as the current configuration.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nIn line with our [V2 to V3 migration plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636), we propose another iteration of RF increases on Aave V2 Ethereum. By progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on V2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to V3. In this proposal, we suggest an increase of  5% for all V2 collateral assets.\n\n## Specification\n\nFrozen Assets:\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV* | Current RF | Rec RF |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 35% / 45% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| BAT | 52% | 38% / 42% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| DPI | 42% | 22% / 32% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 0 | 0 | 45% | 50% |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 | 45% | 50% |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 70% | 65% | 25% | 30% |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 40% | 30% | 25% | 30% |\n| UNI | 77% | 57% / 67% | 65% | 45% / 55% | 25% | 30% |\n| SNX | 59% | 39% / 49% | 46% | 26% / 36% | 40% | 45% |\n| MKR | 64% | 44% / 55% | 59% | 39% / 49% | 25% | 30% |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 47% | 40% | 25% | 30% |\n- Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options.\n\nUnfrozen Assets\n\n| Asset | Current RF | Recommended RF |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DAI | 15% | No Change - will be addressed in a separate proposal  |\n| FRAX | 25% | 30% |\n| GUSD | 15% | 20% |\n| LUSD | 15% | 20% |\n| sUSD | 25% | 30% |\n| TUSD | 25% | 30% |\n| USDC | 15% | 20% |\n| USDP | 15% | 20% |\n| USDT | 15% | 20% |\n| CRV | 25% | 30% |\n| WBTC | 25% | 30% |\n| ETH | 20% | 25% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

After implementing each increment, we'll assess user elasticity and the impact of the updates before moving forward with additional increases. We will ensure a minimum gap of 2 weeks between each subsequent update.\n\n*Please note that a separate proposal will be made for frozen assets on V2.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Current RF | Recommended RF |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DAI | 10% | 15% |\n| FRAX | 20% | 25% |\n| GUSD | 10% | 15% |\n| LUSD | 10% | 15% |\n| sUSD | 20% | 25% |\n| TUSD | 20% | 25% |\n| USDC | 10% | 15% |\n| USDP | 10% | 15% |\n| USDT | 10% | 15% |\n| 1INCH | 20% | 25% |\n| CRV | 20% | 25% |\n| ENS | 20% | 25% |\n| LINK | 20% | 25% |\n| MKR | 20% | 25% |\n| SNX | 35% | 40% |\n| UNI | 20% | 25% |\n| WBTC | 20% | 25% |\n| ETH | 15% | 20% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to increase the debt ceiling of MKR on V3 Ethereum\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum, set at $6M, has reached 100% utilization. \n\nGiven current market conditions and improved liquidity for MKR on Ethereum over the past months, our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling for MKR to $8.5M. \n\nIt is important to note that the majority of MKR debt positions are concentrated within two accounts, accounting for over 80% of the total debt, as outlined below. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0) -  borrowing $3.11M DAI against his 5,914 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 52% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2. [0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05) -  borrowing $1.84M USDC against his 4,077 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 31% of the debt ceiling.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for CRV on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing our recommendations to decrease Aave’s exposure to CRV on V2 Ethereum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31), we propose a series of LT and LTV reductions. The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum. \n\nGiven the current conditions and protocol usage, we propose 2 options for the community to vote on:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-CRV-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-7-10-32dc4ed994be4029b05af831ce5ea537).\n2. “Moderate” - 3% reduction. This option is aligned with the previous reduction and the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nIn the table below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. \n\n| Option | Liquidation Threshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Moderate | 52 | 3 | $46 |\n| Aggressive | 49 | 5 | $116 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 55 | 52 / 49 | -3% / -6% |\n| CRV | LTV | 49 | 46 / 43 | -3% / -6% |\n\n*Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the “aggressive” and “moderate” options*\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
