        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce LT and LTV for USDC on Aave V2\n\n# Motivation\n\nFollowing our [ongoing reduction](https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766) of stablecoin LTs and LTVs on Aave V3 markets, we propose reducing LTs and LTVs on V2 to limit risks posed by the current parameters and align them closer to V3’s parameters. \n\nIt is important to note that in some cases, it is difficult to reduce LTs because of users looping assets with themselves. For example, on Ethereum, there are 58 wallets that are both supplying and borrowing more than 10,000 USDC. This leads us to recommend two different options on which the community can decide: a more aggressive LT reduction, which will result in more liquidations but help reduce LT more quickly and a conservative LT reduction, which will prioritize limiting liquidations. For all options, we recommend decreasing LTV to the target of 75%. \n\n## LT/LTV Reduction\n\nThe overall goal of our stablecoin LT/LTV reduction is the same as on V3, ultimately achieving the following parameters:\n\n| Final LTV | Final LT |\n| --- | --- |\n| 75.00% | 78.00% |\n\n***USDC (Ethereum)***\n\nCurrently, reducing LT would require inducing a significant number of liquidations; a reduction of just 0.50% would create $137K in new liquidations, and a 2% reduction would create $200K in new liquidations. This is largely caused by two users ([1](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb60bda0bab52839a3334bd849d2afb2aa566e631), [2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xf451d30a7ac2e56f52a36825b155b0ac1fb7a867)), both of whom are looping USDC with itself. Thus, our conservative proposal is not adjusting LT, while the aggressive calls for reducing it by 0.50%.\n| Asset | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservative | - | - |\n| Aggressive | 137.3K | 10 |\n\n***USDC.e (Polygon)***\n\nSimilar to USDC on Ethereum, it is difficult to reduce the LT without inducing large liquidations, thus the conservative proposal calls for a reduction to 84.50%.\n\nThe three largest potential liquidations ([1](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb3095b2861fba8ebcfd199546ce9488c75676850),[2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0x299b189f47838ee8ebb630c3024bb1cd9f109ee8),[3](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0x818b84cc4c3012cb6b36bfb627fd82438718fc7c)), representing the majority of new value eligible for liquidation, are all wallets that are looping USDC.e with itself.\n\nThe more aggressive approach would reduce LT to 83% and potentially induce $103K worth of liquidations.\n\n| Asset | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservative | 10K | 45 |\n| Aggressive | 103K | 235 |\n\n\n***USDC.e (Avalanche)***\n\nOur approach involves reducing USDC.e’s LT to 78%, inducing $10,300 worth of liquidations across 11 new wallets.\n\nAgain, the largest liquidation would be a [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xdb815d4071c3d8b2ebec6c003f30bfbfa6a5d8b8) who is looping USDC.e. This would bring the market in line with our final parameters, and thus there is no need for an aggressive proposal.\n\n# Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec LT (Moderate/Aggressive) | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| Ethereum | USDC | 80.00% | 75.00% | 87.50% | No Change / 87.00% | \n| Polygon | USDC.e | 80.00% | 75.00% | 85.00% | 84.50% / 83.00% | \n| Avalanche | USDC.e | 75.00% | No Change | 80.00% | 78.00% | \n\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

However, this must be balanced with proper risk management to ensure that there is a sufficient buffer in the event of large drawdowns and/or liquidations. The analysis below was conducted utilizing our LT simulations, which showed either minimal or no increases in VaR at the recommended LT levels while also considering user distribution and on-chain liquidity.\n\n### sAVAX\n\nsAVAX’s LTV and LT are currently set to 30% and 40%, respectively (its E-Mode parameters are 92.5% and 95%). The top suppliers are primarily looping sAVAX and WAVAX, reducing the risk of large-scale liquidations in this market. \n\nHowever, there are is a small amount of non-WAVAX borrows against sAVAX, primarily WETH.e and stablecoins.\n\n\nMoreover, sAVAX maintains strong liquidity against AVAX, meaning that potential liquidations of sAVAX collateralized debt are likely to be completed efficiently.\n\n\nGiven user distribution and liquidity, we recommend increasing LTV to 40% and LT to 45%.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend making the following changes:\n\n| Chain | Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Avalanche | sAVAX | LTV | 30% | 40% |\n| Avalanche | sAVAX | Liquidation Threshold | 40% | 45% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

Following our observations and simulations, we believe increasing the LT and LTV for this market is prudent.\n\nsAVAX's average market cap over the past 180 days is $257M, and its daily average volume is $3.1M. It has registered a daily annualized volatility of 90.88%, a 30-day annualized volatility of 74.11%, and its largest single-day price drop was 14.5%.\n\n\nIts supply is well distributed, with all but two of the top 10 suppliers leveraging the asset with WAVAX. \n\n\nSupply has been trending upward since the end of July. \n\n\n95.6% of the value of assets borrowed against sAVAX is WAVAX in E-Mode. USDC is the most popular non-E-Mode asset borrowed.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend increasing sAVAX’s LTV and LT and increasing its LTV in E-Mode by a small amount. \n\n| Asset | Chain | Market | Current LTV | Recommended LTV | Current LT | Recommended LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sAVAX | Avalanche | Main | 40% | 50% | 45% | 55% |\n| sAVAX | Avalanche | E-Mode | 92.5% | 93% | 95% | - |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust ten (10) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across five (5) Aave V3 assets.\n\n- GNO on Gnosis\n- OP on Optimism\n- ARB on Arbitrum\n- stMATIC on Polygon\n- MaticX on Polygon\n\n## Analysis\n\nIncreasing the liquidation threshold and LTV for assets allows Aave to enhance users’ capital efficiency. However, this must be balanced with proper risk management to ensure that there is a sufficient buffer in the event of large drawdowns and/or liquidations. The analyses below were conducted utilizing our LT simulations, which showed either minimal or no increases in VaR at the recommended LT levels, while also considering user distribution and on-chain liquidity.\n\n### GNO (Gnosis)\n\nGNO is in isolation mode with a debt ceiling of $2M, with $971K borrowed against it, split between USDC and WXDAI. The top suppliers of GNO have strong health scores of over 3, while some do not borrow against GNO.\n\nGiven the user distribution and liquidity, we recommend increasing the LT to 53% and the LTV to 48%.\n\n### OP (Optimism)\n\nUSDC and USDT are the most popular assets borrowed against OP collateral, together with DAI representing 71% of the total debt against OP. These positions are thus at risk of liquidation should OP’s price fall. \n\nHowever, the largest suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores and on-chain liquidity would support their liquidation.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### ARB (Arbitrum)\n\nThere is currently $5.64M borrowed against $28.5M ARB in this market, the majority of which is stablecoins.\n\nCollateral at risk increases smoothly as ARB’s price declines, and we find that on-chain liquidity can support efficient liquidations. \n\nGiven this, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### stMATIC (Polygon)\n\nThere is $6.28M borrowed against $30.09M stMATIC in this market, with $2.4M of that borrowed in E-Mode. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of USDC.e.\n\nThe top suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores, with the largest borrowing just $82K against $12M stMATIC, putting this market at relatively lower risk of large scale liquidations.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 48% and the LT to 58%.\n\n### MaticX (Polygon)\n\n75% of the value borrowed against MaticX is associated with MATIC-correlated assets in E-Mode, putting these positions at a relatively lower risk of liquidation. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of stablecoins, with USCD.e the largest.\n\nThe largest MaticX suppliers are either looping with WMATIC, borrowing a small amount of WETH, or borrowing USDC.e. \n\nGiven on-chain liquidity and user distribution, we recommend increasing the LTV to 50% and the LT to 60%.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend making the following changes:\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec. LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gnosis | GNO | 45% | 48% | 50% | 53% |\n| Optimism | OP | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Arbitrum | ARB | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Polygon | stMATIC | 45% | 48% | 56% | 58% |\n| Polygon | MaticX | 45% | 50% | 58% | 60% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

By keeping tighter caps relative to current demand, we aim to protect the protocol from potential risks associated with abnormal or unexpected events. These risks include significant stablecoin depegging and major hacks, which could result in an unexpected surge of risk in the protocol.\n\nShould demand for these stablecoins increase, we can adjust the caps accordingly based on our established supply and borrow cap methodology.\n\nThis approach seeks to enhance the protocol's resilience and stability in fluctuating market conditions, protecting the interests of Aave users and stakeholders.\n\n### Notable Low Utilization Stablecoins (crvUSD, LUSD)\n\nThere is currently low demand and utilization for crvUSD and LUSD across multiple Aave markets, highlighting a need for reassessment of borrow caps to match the reduced activity:\n\n- crvUSD on Ethereum has a current supply utilization of only 0.85%, which saw spikes up to only 4% in the last six months.\n- LUSD on Optimism also continues to experience low utilization rates, with just 7.83% supply utilization.\n\n\n\n### Ethena sUSDe\n\nThe supply utilization of Ethena sUSDe spiked to 4% during the listing and later stabilized around 1%. Maintaining a supply cap so high exposes the protocol to unnecessary risk.\n\n\n\n\n### Highly Liquid Stablecoins (DAI, USDC)\n\nWhile DAI on AAVE V3 Optimism and USDC on AAVE V3 BNB Chain are highly liquid safe assets, the high supply cap causes the markets to be underutilized.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe target recommendations are calculated as twice the highest demand observed over the past six months or as 75% of the on-chain supply, whichever is lower. We suggest lowering the supply and borrow caps for the following assets, as outlined below.\n\n| Market | Asset | Current Supply Cap | Current Supply Utilization | Recommended Supply Cap | Current Borrow Cap | Current Borrow Utilization | Recommended Borrow Cap |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethereum | crvUSD | 60,000,000 | 0.85% | 5,000,000 | 50,000,000 | 0.80% | 2,500,000 |\n| Optimism | LUSD | 3,000,000 | 7.83% | 2,000,000 | 1,210,000 | 11.33% | 500,000 |\n| Ethereum | sUSDe | 85,000,000 | 1.14% | 4,000,000 | - | - | - |\n| Optimism | DAI | 25,000,000 | 12.17% | 10,000,000 | 16,000,000 | 17.00% | 7,000,000 |\n| BNB | USDC | 50,000,000 | 6.02% | 15,000,000 | 45,000,000 | 5.39% | 10,000,000 |\n\n# **Next Steps**\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
