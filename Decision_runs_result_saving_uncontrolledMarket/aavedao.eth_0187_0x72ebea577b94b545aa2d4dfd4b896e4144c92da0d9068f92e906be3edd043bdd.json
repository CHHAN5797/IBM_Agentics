        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard ggAVAX to Aave V3 on Avalanche \nDate: 2024-04-29\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe current proposal is set to add ggAVAX, a liquid staking AVAX token issued by the Gogopool protocol, to the AAVE V3 Avalanche market.\n\n### Motivation\n\nGoGoPool is one of the largest Avalanche DeFi protocols. It is ranked number 6 on the Avalanche C-Chain in terms of TVL chain and currently controls more than 500k AVAX (~$23M at current market prices).\n\nWe believe there is currently very large underserved demand for borrowing AVAX against ggAVAX, as ggAVAX is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche. The APYs currently range between 7% and 8%, which is on the order of 33% more yield than any existing competitors on Avalanche. \n\nBeing the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche makes ggAVAX perfect for being a collateral asset, especially for those who seek leveraged exposure to native AVAX yields.\n\n \n![dd93fbd27bc1aac727035529eb5ff6253f57edc8.png](ipfs://bafkreibcfworgked4rc5maanvobvklqy6rmwchfk7rjyoswvyd2chpzsbu)\n    \n\n\nThis yield is achieved through a mix of no protocol fees, running validators instead of utilizing delegation mechanisms, and generating MEV yield from positive market interactions (see dashboard for more details: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK)). \n\nThere is currently more than ~80k AVAX in the ggAVAX-AVAX pools across Balancer and Wombat, making it the most liquid Avalanche LST relative to its size.\n\n \n![8867ec44b2d0dc326eaf4b928b7d7c889eb5f113.png](ipfs://bafkreig3f2xualvcqedjubvgg66tj3jwfkccocvm53l5dc5xtmmo6r5px4)\n    \n\n\nBesides the deep on-chain liquidity, ggAVAX allows users to redeem ggAVAX for underlying AVAX at an internal rate and with no fees. These redemptions are instant as long as there is enough AVAX in the ggAVAX smart contract to facilitate them.\n\nGoGoPool is backed by the Avalanche Foundation and industry-leading investors. In 2022, It raised $7.5M in two rounds [led by Framework Ventures and Coinfund and](https://www.theblock.co/post/166498/gogopool-raises-5-million-to-provide-decentralized-staking-on-avalanche?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) with participation from Silverstone Ventures, Fintech Collective, and Avalaunch. \n\nThe protocol has been [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/GoGoPool%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Kudelski Security](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f90a8443126c2ee50f4c4e/643ee88bf91b375b39ba2613_Kudelski_multisig_labs_report_1.1.pdf) with an additional [Code4rena](https://docs.gogopool.com/audits/code4rena-audit) audit contest. It also has an ongoing [bug bounty program with Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/gogopool/).\n\n### Benefits of listing ggAVAX\n\nListing of ggAVAX on AAVE would create additional demand for borrowing AVAX (in E-Mode) and other assets. Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.\n\nCurrently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nAave V3 on Avalanche.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWith the recent implementation of [Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51), ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed. This is the same approach that AAVE currently uses for sAVAX, wstETH, cbETH, weETH and other LSTs (and LRTs)\n\nggAVAX’s CAPO, however, might require a max growth ratio higher than the 10.1% currently set for sAVAX to account for a generally higher level of yield.\n\nWe welcome any questions about ggAVAX architecture and protocol structure and look forward to working on this with the DAO.\n\n### Specification\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (ggAVAX)|70,000|\n|Borrow Cap (ggAVAX)|NA|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|\n|LTV|30.00%|\n|LT|40.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|NA|\n|Variable Slope2|NA|\n|Uoptimal|NA|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|Emode|No|\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments\n\nGoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.\n\nAfter the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults. \n\nThese and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general. Note that we have already had preliminary talks with a number of protocols on this subject.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://www.gogopool.com/) \n\n[Github](https://github.com/multisig-labs/)\n\n[Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK) \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogopool_)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gogopool.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n### **Author:  @Ethan - Threshold Network Growth Coordinator**\n\n### **Date: 2024-04-24**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\nThe proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.\n\n## Motivation/Background:\n\ntBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum's Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.\n\nHaving recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).\n\nBenefits for Aave:\n\n* Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.\n* A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n* Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.\n* Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n* Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium's LTIPP.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\nContract Addresses:\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nEthereum: 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\nOptimism: 0x5a61374950D4BFa5a3D4f2CA36FC1d23A92b6f21\n\nUseful Links (the number of posted links is limited to 5 for new users, hence the intended spacing between \"h\" and \"ttps\"):\n\nProject: h ttps://www.threshold.network/\n\nMinting dashboard: h ttps://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint\n\nGitHub: h ttps://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2\n\nDocs: h ttps://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2\n\nAudit: h ttps://threshold.network/about#audits\n\nImmunfi Bug Bounty: h ttps://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\nLlama Risk Report: https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/tBTC\n\nTwitter: h ttps://twitter.com/thetnetwork\n\nDiscord: h ttps://discord.gg/threshold\n\nDune: h ttps://dune.com/threshold/tbtc & h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n\n#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThreshold Network has no link and is not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal.\n\n#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by native BTC. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for native BTC without a centralized custodian. It can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\ntBTC can be used as collateral, liquidity, a store of value, and can be integrated with DeFi apps across all supported blockchains.\n\nAs with other BTC wrappers, tBTC provides cryptocurrency traders and general users with a BTC-pegged token, that can be used to generate yield whilst holding native BTC.\n\n#### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nAdding support for tBTC on Aave V3 as an asset would allow tBTC holders to obtain a yield on their tBTC holdings.\n\nIn Aave’s [document hub](https://docs.aave.com/hub/), the first line self-describes Aave as “a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol”, Threshold Network is looking to help Aave fully realise this by allowing access to tBTC, which unlike its centralized competitor (wBTC), is the only way to permissionlessly borrow and lend BTC in a decentralized manner. This gives Aave direct access to the 1.3 trillion market and 106 million owners of BTC, for which wBTC provides limited access to.\n\n#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n#### How is tBTC currently used?\n\ntBTC is currently used across the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon and Solana ecosystems. tBTC exhibits strong usecase across decentralized exchanges, lending on Solana and Bitcoin Options on Base and as collateral for crvUSD, a broad overview can be found here:\nhttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\n\n#### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation\n\nThe Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:\n\nCouncil Multisig Ethereum Address: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\n#### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $195,000,000 USD / 2,960 BTC\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools: h ttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\nDashboard on Decentralized LP liquidity: h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n#### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 7,251\nTwitter: 37,200\nGithub: 4,596 commits\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of Deployment: February 2023\nNumber of transactions: 27,986\nNumber of token holders: 756\n\n#### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams, we suggest the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nSymbol: TBTC\n\nContract Addresses\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|N/A|\n|Borrow Cap|2 Million USD|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|35%|\n|LT|78%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Threshold Network.

CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. \n\nTo enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).\n\nCurrently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. \n\nOther liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. \n\nThe liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\nIntegrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.\n\nConfidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\n [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.\n\nIntegration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.\n\n### Specification\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Audits & Relevant links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n Issuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nWhitepaper: CDCETH\nDeFillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: https://crypto.com/staking\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\n\nCommunity:\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/cryptocom\nTelegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nNews on Telegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nDiscord: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal. The co-author is a team member of [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/).\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 800 Mn+ (~270k Eth) TVL\n- 20K+ restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH, sfrxETH, and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\n*> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-08-09 and ARFC has been updated.* It is recommended listing rsETH using an exchange rate oracle. \n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 19,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,900 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-Correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9.83% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn\n    - Few others\n- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)\n\n**Oracles**:\n\nrsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:\n\nChainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6\n\nChainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nRedstone market feed:\n\n[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nrsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.\n\nAccepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.\n\nExchange rate calculation -\n\nA → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain\n\nB → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]\n\nC → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]\n\nD → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]\n\nE → Total supply of rsETH\n\nExchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nPrior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. \n\nNevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n* [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n* Contract Address:[ 0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n* [GitHub Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
