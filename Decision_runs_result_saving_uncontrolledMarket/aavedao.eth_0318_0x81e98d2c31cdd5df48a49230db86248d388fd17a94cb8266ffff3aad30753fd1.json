This will maintain Aaveâ€™s position as the prime liquidity protocol by increasing our protocol attractiveness for users looking to maximize their capital efficiency.\n\n# Specification\n\n**stETH E-Mode Ethereum**\n\nUpdate ETH-correlated E-Mode parameters with the following values.\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 90% | 93% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93% | 95% |\n\nWe propose no changes to the stETH non-E-Mode parameters.\n\n**wstETH E-Mode Arbitrum**\n\nUpdate ETH-correlated E-Mode parameters with the following values.\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 90% | 93% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93% | 95% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 2% | 1% |\n\nWe propose no changes to the stETH non-E-Mode parameters.\n\n**wstETH E-Mode Optimism**\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 90% | 93% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93% | 95% |\n\nWe propose no changes to the stETH non-E-Mode parameters.\n\n********WETH Ethereum********\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% |\n| Optimal Ratio | 80% | 90% |\n\nOther parameters will remain unchanged. \n\n********WETH Arbitrum********\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% |\n| Optimal Ratio | 80% | 90% |\n\nOther parameters will remain unchanged. \n\n********WETH Optimism********\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% |\n| Optimal Ratio | 80% | 90% |\n\nOther parameters will remain unchanged. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

There is an additional risk of GHO being redeemed from the SM and sold in the market. There are currently around [5.2M GHO cooling off](https://dune.com/xmc2/aave-safety-module) from the stkGHO module.\n\nTo support the GHO peg and to pave the way for future GHO supply expansion, this publication proposes increasing the daily AAVE emission going to stkGHO holders. \n\nThis publication also proposes to offset this increase in AAVE emissions by reducing the emissions directed to stkAAVE and stkBPT holders. The overall amount of AAVE per day is to remain unchanged. \n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will implement the following changes to the AAVE emissions across the three SM categories: \n\n| Asset | Current AAVE/Day | Proposed AAVE/Day |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| stkAAVE | 385 | 360 |\n| stkGHO | 50 | 100 |\n| stkBPT (AAVE/wstETH) | 385 | 360 |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Increase GHO Borrow Rate\n## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n## Date: 2023-08-23\n---\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes an increase in the borrow rate of GHO from the current rate of 1.5% to 2.5%. The aim is to address the peg deviation of GHO and ensure its growth and trustworthiness in the market.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nGHO has witnessed a rapid growth, reaching a circulating supply of 22M in just a few weeks since its launch. One of the primary reasons for this growth, especially in the current adverse market conditions, is the GHO borrow rate set below the market price of stablecoin borrows. This low rate, combined with the current lack of holding venues and the inability to use GHO as collateral, has made single-side liquidity provision in stableswaps, such as Balancer pools, [one of the most sought-after strategies.](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity)\n\nWhile deep liquidity and growth are desired as a go-to-market strategy for GHO, the peg deviation of GHO (currently around $0.975) is affecting its growth and trust in the market. A consensus short-term solution to this issue is to slightly raise the GHO borrow rate from 1.5% to 2.5%. This rate remains attractive for borrowers and is still below the market average rates. However, by reducing the discount, it is anticipated to have a positive effect.\n\nThis proposal is particularly relevant in the context of the potential [sDAI onboarding integration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sdai-aave-v3-onboarding/14410). This integration is expected to add short-term sell pressure on GHO, especially with the current borrow rate, which could further harm the GHO peg.\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Asset**: GHO\n- **Contract Address**: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f\n- **Current Borrow Rate**: 1.5%\n- **Proposed Borrow Rate**: 2.5%\n- **New discounted Borrow Rate**: ~1.75%\n\n## Disclamer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, implement the proposed changes to the GHO borrow rate.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Title: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard STG to Ethereum Aave v3\n## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n## Date: 2023-09-07\n\n--\n\n## Summary:\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the onboarding of the STG token to the Ethereum Aave v3 Liquidity Pool. \n\n## Motivation:\n\nStargate is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol central to Omnichain DeFi. It enables users and dApps to transfer native assets across chains while tapping into the protocolâ€™s unified liquidity pools with immediate guaranteed finality. \n\nOver the past month, Stargate has processed transactions exceeding $3.4 Billion, marking its position as the largest bridge in the crypto domain. The STG token, serving as the utility and governance token for the Stargate protocol, boasts a market capitalization of roughly $110,000,000 and a circulating supply nearing 200,000,000 STG.\n\nIntegrating the STG token into the Ethereum Aave v3 will enhance asset diversification, offering borrowers and lenders expanded avenues to leverage the protocol. This integration will empower users to deposit STG as collateral and also borrow STG, paving the way for new revenue streams for Aave.\n\nThis onboarding is considered in isolation mode with conservative LTV and debt ceiling parameters to limit protocol exposure.\n\n## Specification:\n\n\n- **Ticker**: STG\n- **Contract Address**: 0xaf5191b0de278c7286d6c7cc6ab6bb8a73ba2cd6\n- **Chainlink Oracle STG/USD**: [Chainlink Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7A9f34a0Aa917D438e9b6E630067062B7F8f6f3d)\n\n### Proposed Risk Parameters:\n\n| Parameter               | Value       |\n|-------------------------|-------------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)     | 35%    |\n| Liquidation Threshold   | 40%    |\n| Liquidation Penalty     | 10%    |\n| Reserve Factor          | 20%    |\n| Debt Ceiling            | 5M$ |\n| Supply Cap            | 10M STG |\n| Borrow Cap            | 8M STG |\n| Stable borrowing | Disabled |\n| Optimal Utilization Ratio | 45% |\n| Base rate | 0% |\n| Slope 1 | 7% |\n| Slope 2 | 300% |\n\n(Note: If this proposal reaches ARFC stage, the risk Teams will be invited to provide feedback and fine-tune these parameters)\n\n## Next Steps:\n1.

        "body": "[ARFC] MaticX Supply Cap Increase in Polygon V3\n\nAuthor: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\n\nDate: 2024-01-30\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to increase the MaticX Supply Cap on Polygon V3 to match market demand.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nIncreasing the supply cap of Polygon MaticX in the Aave market is a strategic move to accommodate growing demand, and follow a previous DAO decision to maintain aggressive supply caps for correlated assets. \n\nDeposits of MaticX have been over 95% of the supply cap for some time. Increasing the Supply Cap will enable users to continue depositing MaticX and enter the recursive MaticX/wMATIC yield strategy. \n\nThe DAO has previously voted to allow assets with correlated borrow supply caps to be up to 75% of cumulative supply. Since this exceeds the supply cap increase allowable by risk stewards, this proposal will increase supply caps through the typical ARFC process. Current circulating supply is over 100M, so this proposal will increase the supply cap to 75M.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nIncrease the supply cap for MaticX on Polygon V3 to the following. \n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| SupplyCap | 62M | 75M |\n\nUseful Links\n\n- [Previous ARFC MaticX Supply Cap Increase](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/278/)\n- [MaticX in Polygon V3 Market](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6&marketName=proto_polygon_v3)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to AIP stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
