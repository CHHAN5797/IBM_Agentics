        "body": "# Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the ideas and concepts introduced by [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) in the initial [Operation Company (OpCo) proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737). The OpCo is a legal entity that delegates and key stakeholders can leverage to achieve DAO-defined goals, principally by forming an operational mesh layer and assigning internal employees or negotiating and entering into agreements with service providers and individual contributors to facilitate initiatives. OpCo’s mission is to negate identified frictions affecting the DAO’s strategy execution, such as allowing for the establishment of more operational roles for the DAO, facilitating efficient and competitive contributor and service provider negotiations and information flow between these parties, creating clear responsibilities for carrying out initiatives, and helping ensure the continuation of programs the DAO depends upon. OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes a potential advancement that could be made within its mandated focus areas, it can work on and propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Arbitrum DAO is generally unable to move swiftly when it requires specialized contributors to execute a strategy, for which there isn’t a straightforward and low-friction approach, with these processes typically requiring a vast amount of effort from the supply side instead of being driven by the demand side. Moreover, many initiatives, especially more complex and wider-reaching ones, lack clear owners in charge of ensuring a holistic approach to execution and initiatives’ continuation, meaning that in the unfortunate case that a service provider decides/is forced to disengage from its duties, there aren’t always accountable individuals or entities that would push the initiatives forward. OpCo’s goal is to function as the entity the DAO can leverage to remedy these limitations and move forward in areas that require a more structured approach.\n\nTo cover OpCo’s operating expenses over the first 30 months, including full-time staff appointed internally, setup and other admin costs, as well as the DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee, this proposal suggests earmarking 22M ARB (subject to change in either direction if market conditions change notably between the Snapshot and Tally votes) for the initiative:\n\n* 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n* Of the remaining 18M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB’s current price of $1, this would require roughly 12M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following the proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact.\n* After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 22M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\n![ARB Liquidation.png](ipfs://bafybeifs75ocgefcebce7mgv5spdjfubengcta7ua6nz5rbrlbprbbtxvq)\n\nOpCo will be able to utilize the $12M in cash equivalents as follows:\n\n* $2.5M worth of stable assets released upfront.\n* Once OpCo has officially operationalized, the entity can draw up to $500K of cash equivalents each month.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPresently, most DAO programs operate in silos, leading to, among other things, redundant efforts and non-existing cross-initiative resources. The DAO also generally depends on a single initiative leader for the continuation of a successful program, while some initiatives don’t even have clear owners, which adds significant friction to strategy execution. DAOs are also inherently disadvantaged when evaluating and swiftly engaging individual contributors or service providers, and Arbitrum is no exception. This proposal aims to provide the DAO with the capabilities to nullify the abovementioned frictions by creating a DAO-adjacent legal entity—OpCo. Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage OpCo to manage:\n\n* Operational support & project planning,\n* Project management of DAO initiatives,\n* Negotiations with service providers,\n* Allocation of resources across contributors & DAO-approved projects\n\nOpCo will grant the Arbitrum DAO better capabilities to bootstrap initiatives and secure the continuation and execution of them, while also expanding the total addressable contributor and service provider base as certain sensitive negotiations and deal terms don’t necessarily have to be disclosed publicly. Moreover, the DAO-adjacent entity will function as the operational mesh layer for individual contributors and service providers, streamlining communications and knowledge sharing across engaged entities and individuals.\n\nOverall, the DAO’s past, current, and likely upcoming initiatives can be divided into 5 high-level categories: Governance Frameworks, Financial Management, Investments, Ecosystem Support, and Grants. The initiatives, their respective owners, and into which of the 5 categories they fall are visualized below.\n\n![Current Initiatives.png](ipfs://bafybeidaponefn7ospa42xhhtdhcw2v33to5yvrskyrvcxbmtagwwl24ru)\n\nIt is of utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO maintains a decentralized and bottoms-up system for bootstrapping new projects, DAO contributors, and setting strategies, including creating and steering the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose, as well as approaches to achieve the goals and decision-making. As such, OpCo will be focused on the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management initiative categories, but note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category if the DAO so chooses through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n\nThe entity’s main focus is to increase the efficiency of strategy execution through operational optimization and, in particular, activating and recruiting the optimal stakeholders, contributors, and service providers. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO would always have ultimate authority over OpCo, with the entity purely being a helpful resource focused on streamlining wider-reaching and complex initiatives that require a more structured execution framework as well as helping push the DAO forward within areas where the entity identifies shortcomings. We want to stress the importance of ensuring that one of Arbitrum DAO’s key differentiators—enabling new participants to join the ecosystem and make an impact, growing into well-established contributors—is conserved. Without Arbitrum DAO empowering its contributors and delegates, the DAO might sacrifice one of its core strengths, and we believe that entities such as SEEDGov, Entropy Advisors, Tally, etc., are present within the ecosystem exactly because of this empowerment.\n\nArbitrum has one of the most active and engaged DAOs within the industry, combined with help from the Arbitrum Foundation and robust programs for bootstrapping and fostering growth within the ecosystem. Although there is always room for improvement, these factors have enabled the DAO to allocate grants with positive results, sustaining a vibrant and welcoming ecosystem. Having said that, if the DAO wishes to, it can expand OpCo’s mandate to include grants in the future through a Snapshot vote. When it comes to investments from treasury funds, the GCP has been established to facilitate capital allocation into the gaming sector, while the AVI is currently working on setting up a structure allowing the DAO to make venture bets across other verticals, which is why OpCo will be excluded from operating within the investments category. As alluded to earlier, we also feel as though it’s crucial that the facilitation and implementation of governance frameworks continue being driven by decentralized actors, but the DAO could again expand OpCo’s operations into this initiative category if it so wishes.\n\nWith that said, certain clear inefficiencies have been identified with respect to the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories. This is likely due to the operational frameworks enabling execution for these categories still being somewhat underexplored areas. As such, there is a lack of ownership, and the DAO has no structured way to frictionlessly operationalize contributors to push complex challenges forward within these verticals, often requiring a vast amount of Arbitrum DAO-specific knowledge and even lobbying efforts from the supply side instead of the demand side. Due to the current structure, active governance participants are generally purely incentivized to prioritize strategies that they are fit to solve. This has left certain critical domains unattended and reflects the need for an entity that could be mandated to help define the root causes of execution obstacles and provide solutions to remedy them.\n\nThe aforementioned inefficiencies are naturally amplified by the fact that the number of potential contributors is often restricted due to many initiatives requiring deep specialization. Finding the facilitators capable of managing initiatives end-to-end within these categories can be difficult. Oftentimes, the contributor and owner roles for initiatives are separated or there is not a clear owner at all, meaning that no one party is responsible for the continuation of these initiatives. For initiatives where the contributor and owner roles are the same or there is a clearly defined owner, the DAO generally relies on a single party for the continuation of the initiative. If the service provider or contributor, for any reason, decides or is forced to exit the ecosystem, there is not a well-defined framework for the initiative to be moved to a new owner.\n\nAs initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates. However, OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developments could be made, it can propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nTypically, the current protocol for the execution of strategies and new initiatives within the DAO’s two aforementioned focus areas is as follows: (i) either the proposer defines the strategic approach and goals for the initiative or a working group is created that aims to outline these specifics such that a proposal can be created, with the working group also sometimes facilitating some or all of the work required for the execution of the strategy; (ii) if not done by the working group, the proposer or proposer-connected party is contracted to facilitate the strategy or the DAO runs some type of a procurement/election process to decide the service providers or contributors; (iii) once the work has been performed and the facilitators’ term ends, a continuation proposal is created if the initiative has a clear owner. Otherwise, individual DAO contributors are required to take charge of the initiative and push it forward.\n\nIf OpCo were to be created, it would primarily be leveraged to assume responsibility for phases (ii) and (iii). I.e., the DAO defines strategies or simply strategic goals. If a clear executor to reach the key objectives exists within the DAO, they could be chosen as a facilitator and would be contracted by the OpCo. If not, OpCo could be mandated to execute these strategies by either assigning existing internal employees, hiring new internal resources, or contracting outside service providers/individual contributors to perform the required undertakings. However, if the DAO isn’t proactively defining strategies/strategic goals, OpCo is required to be active within this area as well, given it has the bandwidth to do so, with these OpCo-created strategies then ratified by the DAO through the regular voting process.\n\nOpCo would have full discretion over hiring internal employees, while anyone interested in facilitating a DAO initiative could propose themselves (or another party) for that. Such a proposal must include a capital allocation to cover the facilitator’s expenses since OpCo’s budget only covers internal employees’ salaries. If approved through governance, the facilitator would then be contracted by OpCo as a service provider for the DAO. Depending on what is viewed as the most efficient approach, OpCo will have the ability to negotiate and run procurement processes both privately and publicly, which will further strengthen the Arbitrum DAO’s ability to attract and retain top talent, with all information that can be shared with the wider DAO being made available through oversight and financial reports. The below slide depicts OpCo’s initial focus categories, but please note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category.\n\n![Future Structure.png](ipfs://bafybeiewjs6bgbqbbnrswbtdxkd2f2wr6b2ymjatwwu26ojtufsxfy3u5m)\n\nIf a DAO-ratified strategy or strategic goal that the OpCo is mandated to facilitate doesn’t have a specific end date, the DAO-adjacent entity would continue executing until the entity feels as though the associated goals have been reached or the DAO instructs the entity to stop executing by passing a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). If the work is expected to be long-term in nature, OpCo would be responsible for ensuring that it can be continued by accounting for associated costs in its budget extension request.\n\nFor example, delegates could define a high-level events strategy by deciding the number of events the Arbitrum DAO should be represented at in 2025, whether the strategy facilitator is the proposer, a proposer-related party, an OpCo internal employee, or someone who is chosen through a procurement process, and approving the strategy’s costs that are not covered by OpCo’s budget (i.e., salaries if the facilitators are not full-time staff appointed internally, booking event venues, catering, etc.) through the typical governance process, after which OpCo plans the exact events to participate in, contracts the required service providers or operationalizes internal employees, and manages all involved stakeholders and other related aspects throughout the process.\n\nService providers and individual contributors that are currently contracted, or will likely be in the near future, with the Arbitrum Foundation and fall within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories, such as SEEDGov in its role as the Delegate Incentive Program Manager, MSS members, firms forming the ADPC, Entropy Advisors, etc., should collaborate closely with OpCo once its operations are fully established and stabilized. Once fully operational, OpCo will have the capacity to project manage and oversee these initiatives according to its complete mandate. The long-term vision for this process is as follows:\n\n1. OpCo’s core team is hired, and operations begin;\n2. OpCo demonstrates product-market fit (i.e., the DAO is satisfied with the entity’s output) and that it has adequate processes, capabilities, and any other relevant functions to execute according to its complete mandate;\n3. OpCo is prepared to oversee full-time DAO operations, assuming existing contributor contracts through novation and managing new initiatives on behalf of the DAO (e.g., by ensuring that appropriate KYC measures and documentation are implemented).\n\nIn the case that an integral facilitator within the Ecosystem Support or Financial Management categories (or any other category OpCo might be mandated to operate within in the future) exits the ecosystem for any reason and an initiative is left without an owner, the DAO could likewise mandate OpCo to find a replacement solution.\n\nIt’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm). OpCo internal full-time employees cannot be contributors to DAO initiatives as individuals (they need to do so through OpCo) and are strictly prohibited from entering into employment engagements with other DAOs, organizations, entities, or comparable affiliations, whilst contractors that facilitate a specific vertical and are signed to OpCo can have engagements in other DAO initiatives and outside of the ecosystem. Full-time OpCo staff can only be appointed internally. However, as mentioned earlier, the DAO can roll any service provider or individual contributor into OpCo by passing an onchain vote. This vote has to request capital to cover the facilitators’ expenses since when it comes to salaries, OpCo’s budget only covers internal full-time staff. OpCo is expected to work closely with Offchain Labs as well as the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that scopes of work do not overlap.\n\nIndividual contributors, service providers, and other analogous entities are naturally free to go directly to the DAO to propose they facilitate a workstream and get paid for it without facilitation by the OpCo. However, if the proposed scope of work falls within OpCo’s mandate, it is expected that delegates vote against such a proposal if it can be better executed via OpCo’s involvement. Proposers will be encouraged to engage with OpCo before posting a proposal to the forum to align with the DAO-adjacent entity’s internal employees. OpCo’s internal employees will also proactively communicate with proposal authors and facilitators outside of OpCo such that there is no overlap between deliverables and the future plans for all initiatives are clear.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to mention that the introduction of a DAO-adjacent legal entity carries risks and burdens that shouldn’t be ignored. Among other things, it requires some trust in a select group of facilitators as they are responsible for hiring and procuring the correct contributors as well as operationalizing and managing the DAO-adjacent entity, OpCo’s setup and fixed costs are quite notable, and some amount of administrative work is required that otherwise wouldn’t have arisen.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## OpCo Operational Process\n\nWe expect the general workflow for OpCo to be as follows:\n\n* A forum discussion is initiated, with the owner of that discussion having communicated with OpCo and defined whether the covered subject falls within OpCo’s initial mandate, i.e., the Financial Management or Ecosystem Support verticals.\n* For verticals that are included in OpCo’s mandate, a discussion could broadly take one of the following forms:\n  * A new key objective is introduced, but the roadmap to achieve that objective is unclear: Delegates have the option to create a Snapshot proposal to direct OpCo to produce an onchain proposal that defines the strategy to achieve the key objective(s), whether the entity would procure a facilitator or hire/operationalize an internal employee, as well as any funds needed to cover the strategy’s expenses, excluding OpCo’s internal employee costs. If approved, OpCo would begin facilitating the proposal created by itself. It’s important to note that OpCo, together with its oversight committee (OAT), is responsible for keeping the DAO informed about the entity’s bandwidth. They’ll also provide updates on when current projects are expected to end. This ensures that if there is a sudden spike in new proposals, especially complex and more time-intensive ones, delegates can prioritize and vote on the ones OpCo can take on.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, but the incentive program’s structure and size are unclear. A proposal is passed for OpCo to operationalize internal employees and create the exact strategy. OpCo then defines, e.g., the amount of incentives to be distributed, what the application process to receive incentives looks like, how success will be measured, etc. A proposal to ratify the strategy, the incentives to be distributed, and the required workforce is then created. If passed, OpCo will activate the needed facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) and strategy execution begins.\n  * A new key objective is introduced and the roadmap to achieve that objective is clear: Delegates approve an onchain proposal that defines the strategy, whether the facilitator is the proposer, proposer-related party, an internal OpCo employee, or someone the OpCo procures, and the related expenses excluding facilitator fees for internal OpCo employees, after which strategy execution begins. If a proposal introduces a new key objective with a clear roadmap but that roadmap is ambitious, the OAT together with OpCo should signal how feasible it is for the entity to execute the proposal. If it’s determined that such a roadmap is feasible, the OAT together with OpCo would also communicate whether or not the entity needs more internal resources to be able to execute.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, and the structure and size are clear. An onchain proposal to ratify the strategy, the facilitators, and the capital needed is then created. If passed, the required facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) are contracted by OpCo, or OpCo operationalizes/hires internal employees, depending on the DAO’s decision, and the strategy is activated.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n* Proposals and their execution can still be DAO-led end-to-end and outside of OpCo if delegates vote in this regard. OpCo is a tool for the DAO to leverage if needed.\n* The DAO-adjacent entity is required to be proactive, meaning that internal employees need to actively give feedback in the forums and participate in opinionated discussions.\n* Furthermore, if OpCo has available bandwidth, it should identify areas within its mandated verticals where improvements could be made. If there is no clear owner for such areas and addressing them would benefit the DAO, OpCo should take action. OpCo can create a proposal to define the strategy for addressing the targeted area, requesting funds to cover expenses, excluding costs for OpCo’s internal employees and other related operating expenses, and authorizing the DAO-adjacent entity to operationalize facilitators to execute the strategy.\n\nOpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee. After OpCo’s core team has been hired, the entity has demonstrated product-market fit and readiness to execute according to its complete mandate, OpCo could be leveraged to help develop a DAO-wide budget, in which case the DAO-adjacent entity could hold the budgeted capital for at least the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management categories. In this case, when proposals related to these verticals are passed, no capital would have to be moved from the treasury as OpCo would be able to cover all expenses from its holdings.\n\n## Establishing OpCo\n\nExploratory work on OpCo’s legal structure has already been initiated, but further effort and consultation with key stakeholders, delegates, legal parties, and the Arbitrum Foundation are needed to hammer down the exact structure. Any costs incurred by the Foundation for setting up the legal structure would be reimbursed from capital allocated to this initiative if this proposal were to pass.\n\nOpCo’s initial term will tentatively be 30 months (around 6 months for setup and 24 months for operations from the entity’s official initiation date). The initial term’s length has been chosen to allow ample time for any unforeseen delays in establishing the legal entity, ramping up and stabilizing its operations, and will enable OpCo to focus on more complex and long-term strategies and internalize top talent as a longer initial term provides predictability/job security for employees. Once the first term is coming to an end, the executive-equivalent internal personnel together with OpCo’s oversight committee—the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), introduced below—are required to collaborate to create the continuation proposal for the DAO-adjacent entity. This is expected to cover, among other things, the second OpCo term’s length, the required budget, and any changes or improvements that should be made. It should be noted that if OpCo is required to internalize a vast amount of facilitator roles before a DAO-wide budget is put in place, OpCo might have to create a proposal that would allocate additional funds as its initial exemplary budget has been constructed to cover up to 12 internal full-time employees at different salaries.\n\nTo enable OpCo to successfully fulfill its mandate, the entity should, among other things, have the following initial operational capabilities, internal employees, and resources:\n\n* Internal Finances, Financial Rails, and Controls\n  * Appoint an external accounting and audit firm to maintain financial records and create yearly audits of financial statements and internal controls.\n  * Banking capabilities to be able to convert stablecoins into fiat currency and pay service providers not accepting tokens.\n* Legal\n  * Hire a full-time, in-house legal counsel.\n  * Obtain the required insurances that cover the DAO-adjacent entity as well as internal employees and the OAT.\n* Business-Critical Software\n  * Acquire any needed collaboration and communication tools, accounting and financial management software, human resources management systems, etc.\n* Internal Executive-Equivalent Employees\n  * Chief Chaos Coordinator\n    * Ensures that OpCo has the required internal resources, employees, and contracted service providers such that the DAO-adjacent entity can operate properly and execute strategies mandated by the DAO.\n    * Responsible for building and advancing the entity’s operational structure and managing workflows as initiatives are rolled into the organization and new focus areas are introduced.\n    * Similarly to other executive-equivalent personnel, accountable for adequate record keeping and internal controls.\n    * Collaborates with any other executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT to produce bi-annual oversight and financial reports.\n    * Together with executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT, in charge of creating the continuation proposal for OpCo’s next term.\n  * Chief of Coins\n    * Works with the relevant parties to produce a detailed, actual budget for OpCo, ratified by the OAT and the DAO. In the future, we expect the Chief of Coins to help facilitate a DAO-wide budget together with the relevant parties.\n    * Before a DAO-wide budget is created, responsible for requesting additional funds to ensure the entity’s operations if capital allocated for OpCo’s OpEx is close to being depleted.\n    * Verifies that allocated funds are custodied in a secure manner and utilized as intended.\n    * Makes sure that the OAT and the DAO have required visibility into ongoing expenses, how financials are expected to develop, and any other relevant considerations.\n    * Monitors Arbitrum’s financial performance and makes new recommendations based on this information.\n    * Closely collaborates with entities and individuals responsible for treasury management-related tasks, enabling the creation of a unified asset allocation and risk diversification strategy in line with the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose.\n    * Manages accounting, payroll, and payment infrastructure.\n\n## OpCo KPIs\n\nWe are looking for community feedback on this front, but some potential, apparent KPIs for OpCo (h/t [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) for most of these) include:\n\n* Talent Acquisition, Service Provider Selection, and Program Management\n  * Decrease in time-to-hire, compared to the DAO’s previous structure\n  * Employee engagement and satisfaction\n  * Retention rate\n  * Share of service providers meeting or exceeding performance metrics\n  * Cost savings or added value generated\n  * Diversity of service providers engaged\n* Ecosystem Coordination\n  * Time to solve open questions and other ambiguities\n  * Number of initiatives facilitated and their success\n  * Level of community engagement and stakeholder satisfaction\n  * Agility in adapting objectives\n  * Share of OpCo-initiated strategies accepted by the DAO\n* Performance Tracking and Transparency\n  * Timeliness of oversight and financial reports\n  * Share of data and metrics made publicly available\n  * Community engagement with reports\n\nUltimately, the OAT will be responsible for designing, finalizing, and implementing the relevant KPIs once OpCo is at a point where this can be sufficiently done. We envision that this will be a collaborative effort between the OAT and the DAO, with KPIs reviewed and adjusted periodically based on how OpCo evolves and the community’s feedback.\n\n## OpCo Accountability – The Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT)\n\nThe OAT is a group of five individuals with the primary mandate to oversee OpCo’s operations, ensure the DAO maintains transparency into the DAO-adjacent entity, function as the coordinator between the DAO and OpCo, and establish clear communication channels with the other committees overseeing the separate DAO-adjacent entities such as the GCP and possibly the CapCo in the future should the DAO vote accordingly. More specifically, the OAT’s responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n\n* Accountability: Ensures that OpCo is not overstepping its mandate, over-hiring doesn’t take place, and execution is constrained solely to strategies approved by the DAO. Holds the executive-equivalent personnel accountable, helps produce and approves bi-annual oversight and financial reports, designs relevant KPIs for OpCo once the entity is at a point where this can be sufficiently done, and gives other quarterly updates to the community (such as how OpCo is progressing towards the KPIs designed by the OAT, any operational developments, etc.), reviews all relevant internal materials, and monitors that funds held in OpCo-related wallets are used correctly.\n* Operational Support: Provides assistance in the entity’s legal setup process, gives guidance on OpCo’s operational development, assists the executive-equivalent personnel in producing a continuation proposal for OpCo, and continuously guides OpCo-related contributors to align with the DAO’s will.\n* Hiring, Termination, & Authorization: The OAT, in collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, would hire the executive-equivalent personnel to the OpCo (the Chief Chaos Coordinator, the Chief of Coins, and any other positions of equivalent responsibility that may be introduced in the future) once the legal entity is established. The OAT will help onboard the executive-equivalent personnel and assist in the creation of a standardized onboarding process for future internal employees such that new hires’ expectations are managed properly. Once the first internal employees are hired, the OAT would act as the approving authority when OpCo enters into contracts with service providers or individual contributors, as well as greenlight salaries, larger spends, expenses, and budgets, having the authority to challenge decisions made within OpCo that may have a material, negative impact. Moreover, the OAT would be empowered to terminate service provider/individual contributor/etc. contracts as well as fire OpCo’s internal staff. If the OAT decides to take such an action, the concerned party will be suspended from their duties, and payments will be halted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Removal of OAT Members: OAT Members may be removed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a violation of a conflict of interest or other OpCo policies. In the event of a violation: (A) an OAT Member may call up an internal vote for removal with a memo detailing the alleged violation; (B) for a vote to remove an OAT Member to pass, it must have at least 4 out of the 5 OAT Members voting in favor; and (C) the ArbitrumDAO may also call for a vote to remove OAT Members at any time pursuant to a Temperature Check vote in accordance with the quorum and voting threshold requirements of a Temperature Check. The OpCo Team has the ability to call for a Temperature Check vote to remove an OAT Member as voted upon by the ArbitrumDAO. (i) The OpCo Team member may flag to another OpCo Team member that an election to remove an OAT Member via a Temperature Check vote is warranted; (ii) If such other OpCo Team member considers the request for removal to be warranted, then the OpCo Team member who originally made the flag may call for a removal election (subject to a 3 day feedback period, followed by a 7 day voting period) as a Temperature Check vote; (iii) In the event that a call to remove fails, the OpCo Team member who called for such Temperature Check vote cannot call another vote for removal for a period of 3 months. The process for electing a replacement for a removed OAT member will be equivalent to how the removed member was elected. I.e., if the removed member was elected through a DAO vote, the replacement member will be elected through a DAO vote. If the removed member was elected by the OAT, the OAT will elect the replacement member. A removed OAT member cannot be reappointed to the OAT. Further details on the OAT election process are given below.\n* Coordination: Actively engage with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to align on deliverables and serve as the liaison between delegates, key stakeholders, the wider DAO, and other DAO-adjacent entities’ oversight committees. The OAT will also initiate a monthly OpCo oversight call for community members to get updates on the most recent developments and for them to have the opportunity to make inquiries. A separate forum section will be created for OpCo.\n\n## OAT Election Process\n\nIf this proposal were to pass Snapshot, the formation of the Oversight and Transparency Committee would commence. The DAO would elect 3 individuals to the OAT, with these individuals then promptly appointing 2 additional members with specialized skill sets to ensure all Arbitrum stakeholders’ interests are represented and the OAT’s proficiencies are varied and complete. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation will be given an observing and non-voting sixth seat on the OAT similar to the GCP. OAT members are expected to be able to contribute at least 10 hours per week to OAT-related tasks.\n\nOAT applicants are required to apply as individuals to increase accountability. Applicants are required to disclose any current or possible future conflicts of interest in their applications, including but not limited to financial, personal, and professional. Applicants are also required to disclose all active contributor roles and payment streams related to the Arbitrum DAO that they, and entities that they have a professional or financial relationship with, have and are receiving. The application process for the 3 DAO-elected members would be initiated soon after the OpCo proposal passes an offchain vote and would run for ~3 weeks. Note that the application period can be extended if the size of the applicant pool is limited. A shutterized, weighted voting system will be utilized on Snapshot, and the 3 applicants with the most votes will be chosen as members of the OAT. The DAO-elected members should then prioritize appointing 2 additional members (required to be individuals as well). The 2 additional members don’t have to be appointed at the same time. The additional members will be added to the OAT optimistically, with the DAO having the ability to reject either/both of the additional members through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). All members will serve until the end of the first OAT term unless removed or they resign.\n\nWhile the same internal OpCo employees as well as contracted service providers and individual contributors will continue in their roles across OpCo’s terms if the DAO-adjacent entity is extended in the future, the OAT’s term is 12 months, with a re-election process initiated when the OAT’s term has around 3 months left. The DAO would again choose 3 members who then appoint 2 additional members. If the new cohort is different from the previous one, the previous OAT members are expected to help onboard the new members when the term is coming to an end. There are no consecutive term limits for OAT members. As the OAT is mandated to assist in OpCo’s setup process, the first OAT term will be slightly longer than subsequent ones since it will include the period from when the initial OAT members are selected to the establishment of the entity, plus 12 months from the entity’s official start date.\n\nAny individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-obseving seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\n# NOTE: Due to Snapshot's character limit and the length of this proposal, the following sections have been omitted from this text compared to the forum post: OAT Applicant Requirements, OAT Compensation Structure, Governance and Compliance Requirements for OpCo, its Internal Employees, and the OAT, OpCo Financials and Costs, Snapshot Voting Structure, and Timeline.

        "body": "Non-Constitutional\n\nAbstract\nTLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",

        "body": "Please find the full proposal on the forums, several sections have been removed to adhere to character limits: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437?u=entropy\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe [ArbOS 31 “Bianca”](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) onchain vote on Tally has passed quorum, signaling the DAO’s approval to activate Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time \"Stylus Sprint\" program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks and the program will run for 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign's primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.\n\nInterested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Application Process & RFP Details:\n\nAs mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nThe application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.\n\nTeams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.\n\n### Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors\n\nTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Additionally, a group of advisors will provide consultative support to the committee. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. Currently, there are limited experts qualified to assess Stylus applications effectively. However, should the DAO prefer to engage in a broader selection process that we believe would be inefficient and lead to a less successful program, Entropy Advisors is more than happy to facilitate an RFP process instead, contingent upon a DAO vote to define and appoint these roles.\n\nEvaluation Committee\n\n1. Stylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n2. Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n3. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n4. Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n5. Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n\nCommittee Advisors\n\n1. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. **Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.**\n\nJudges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 2 months will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. **Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.** In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program.\n\n### Multisig Setup\n\nThe Stylus Sprint multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program and 150K ARB for payments to judges. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.\n\n### Funding Levels and Disbursement\n\nTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K, 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones.\n\nUnallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.\n\nFunding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. 50% of funds will be distributed after deployment to encourage teams to think about growth and sustainability post-launch. The criteria for these 2 checkpoints will be proposed by teams in their applications.\n\nAll projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. The above milestone structure, however, is not required. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above. The evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024\n2. Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024\n3. On-Chain Vote - Sept 12, 2024\n6. Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 4, 2024\n\nThe program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal’s passing. The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process. Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis over the next 10 weeks. KYC with the foundation will then begin and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will need to work closely to ensure a strict payment process.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n**5,180,000 ARB**\n\nUp to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus\n\n75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 2 committee members = 150,000 ARB\n\n30,000 ARB paid up front to Questbook.",

        "body": "## TLDR FOR SNAPSHOT VOTING\n* Previosuly known as Questbook grant program, we are seeking renewal for a third season\n* This third iteration will last 1 year\n* The vote is about renewing the program with the 4 historical domain (New protocols and ideas, Dev Tooling, Gaming, Education+Events) or adding a 5th domain (Orbit)\n* Funding will be $1,500,000 for each of the 4 domains for a total of $6,000,000 excluding opex, plus eventually further $750,000 for the Orbit domain (half budget due to being experimental)\n* JoJo will be the PM, Questbook will be the technological partner, and we will have elections for the 4 domain allocator; for Orbit, if passed, we want to appoint [MaxLomu](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/maxlomu/summary) as domain allocator due to his vision and expertise\n* Assuming this snapshot passes, we will then have a candidacy window period, elections after the Christmas break of the DAO, and then Tally vote toward end of January\n\n## Abstract\nThe Arbitrum Domain Allocator Offerings Grant Program (D.A.O.) has operated for one year across two six-month seasons. The program has evolved and improved based on previous results, growing from its first season, which allocated $250,000 across four domains, to a second season with funding of $1,000,000 per domain.\n\nWe are now proposing a third season that would run for a full year, encompassing the existing four domains (Protocols, Education/Community and Events, Dev Tooling, and Gaming) while potentially adding a fifth domain (Orbit). The vision is to create a modular program where new domains can be integrated over time based on DAO requirements and perceived needs. This new season will also improve tracking of grantee progress after funding and facilitate fast-tracking of exceptional projects into other DAO initiatives, such as Arbitrum Foundation programs and the GCP.\n\nQuestbook will serve as the technical partner of the program, offering their services through the Questbook.app portal.\n\n\n## Season 1 and 2 recap\nSeason 1 of the Grant Program was initiated through an RFC in [April 2023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081?u=jojo), designed to serve four distinct domains: New Protocols and Ideas, Dev Tooling, Education/Community/Events, and Gaming. Following a successful [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65) and [tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) vote along with elections for the four DAs, the program officially launched in October 2023. The team consisted of [JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary), [SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov/summary), [Flook](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/flook/summary), and [Juandi](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/juandi/summary) as Domain Allocators, with [Srijith](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/srijith-questbook/summary) serving as Program Manager.\n\nThe first season operated for six months with a budget of $250,000 per domain, totaling $1 million in funding, and implemented a soft cap of $25,000 per project. In April 2024, the program was [renewed](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98446466630612736687159241204141593794174501692677162686607521796118942563659?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) for Season 2 with the same team but expanded funding to $1,000,000 per domain. The soft cap was increased to $50,000, with proposals exceeding $25,000 requiring evaluation from two Domain Allocators.\n\nSeason 2 has now completed its fund allocation phase and will continue operating at reduced capacity for the next six months to oversee milestone completion and grant disbursement. Bear in mind that Season 2 results are partial from the first 6 months, and it will have its natural end in May 2025.\n\nThe following are the numbers so far achieved:\n\n* **Season 1**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 67\n    * Amount of completed projects: 49 / 73%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 8 / 12%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 6 / 9%\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 4 / 6%\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 207\n    * Amount of completed milestones 178 / 86%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 23 / 11%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $997,793\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $852,781 / 86%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $87,512 / 8.5%\n\n*Note: Uncompleted projects are those currently active but were either unable to complete their proposals within the last six months or pivoted to a different idea. Abandoned projects are from teams that weren't able to operate in the market. Withdrawn projects are those that were approved but decided not to proceed with their grant.*\n*While there was no specific timeline set, we feel Season 1 has come to its natural end, and we are in the process of informing teams and withdrawing remaining funds.*\n\n* **Season 2**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 127\n    * Amount of completed projects: 42 / 33%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 85 / 67%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 0\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 0\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 451\n    * Amount of completed milestones 240 / 53%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 211 / 47%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $2,602,247\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $1,356,181 / 44%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $1,246,066 / 41%\n\nMore details on the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ts3oUeRy5cMp-5ksyld570VhmdjdUEVvtt2VhUYxfc4/edit?gid=1462691949#gid=1462691949).\n\n\n\n## Season 3: overview\n\nIn the last year, and potentially for the next year, the D.A.O. Grant Program has brought and will continue to bring the following value to the DAO:\n\n1. Introductory Grant Program: It fills the gap of Arbitrum Foundation grants (usually starting at $50,000, up to $150,000), serving as an entry-level program in our ecosystem.\n2. Transparency: All applications and judgments are available for everyone to read in the portal. Additionally, discussions with protocols are typically maintained in a public Discord with open access.\n3. Targeted Approach: The program has specialized in four specific verticals deemed key by the DAO\n4. High submission amount: between Season 1 and 2 we managed more than 700 proposals, approving around 200.\n\nWhile these points have always been advocated and envisioned as the natural shape of the program, below is a non-comprehensive list of value propositions that has been provided so far through in the last two seasons of the program:\n\n* Enable new teams and small builders to bootstrap their projects\n* Enable mid and big team to prioritize certain deployment in Arbitrum\n* Support Hackathon and Event winners\n* Provide an alternative funding route alongside the Arbitrum Foundation or direct DAO proposals\n* Support projects building upon targeted DAO initiatives\n* Ensure builder diversity, enlarging indirectly Arbitrum mindshare for local builders.\n\nA few specific examples of what we think can be defined as success stories:\n\n* Season 2 has supported both the [winner](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) and [runner-up](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f30eb1c1eb9145098a15e&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66bbd4ee8868f5130a6ffe57&isRenderingProposalBody=true) of Arbitrum GovHack at EthCC\n* Curia's [Governance Dashboard](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66bdceb58868f5130a8cd78d&isRenderingProposalBody=true), initially [rejected](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x573c74706924ce482080ba44deb77d75e8d6bdb516fbbdee54b78861c1683f1b) by the DAO, has been later approved through the grant program with a 20% cost reduction\n* Pear Protocol, currently trading at $7.5M market cap with a $160M cumulative volume in 60 days in the perp space, received a grant to develop their [API module](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x538&isRenderingProposalBody=true) for market makers\n* Mountain protocol, rwa protocol having around $10M in liquidity in Arbitrum, has [bootstrapped its activity in Arbitrum through a grant ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x4ee&isRenderingProposalBody=true)in Season 1\n* Vyper, a language with an extreme mindshare in the Ethereum community, has seen [support to their compiler in Season 2](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f32a15488d5000f0562b3&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66a4e20af2fef64647207b3d&isRenderingProposalBody=true), which will help securing hundreds of millions in DeFi applications\n* Applications like FairAI's are building on top of initiatives such as LTIPP and STIP.b to improve the [discoverability of projects with incentives](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=663ec3d47d71679fa9a3852c&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n\nIn this new iteration, the DA program will last one year. After two six-month seasons with subsequent renewals, there is sufficient maturity in both the program and the DAO to extend it, reducing the burden on delegates for operational renewal and addressing issues such as gaps between seasons.\n\nFunding will be proportional to Season 2, which effectively allocated $750,000 for each of the four domains for six months: for a one-year program, **the funding for the four domains will be $1,500,000 per domain, for a total of $6,000,000 for the four domains excluding OpEx**. Additionally, after discussions with several delegates and the Foundation, and assessment of the current DAO landscape and working groups, there is interest in a potential fifth domain related to Orbit chains. Acknowledging its experimental nature, the proposal suggests funding this domain with half the amount of other domains: $750,000 for one year.\n\nThe grant structure will remain unchanged. Grantees can request up to $25,000 with a single DA review, and up to $50,000 with two DA reviews. Grants will be paid on a milestone basis, where projects must first complete the milestone, verify it with the DA, and then receive the corresponding portion of the grant. Only in exceptional cases, such as when milestone funds are essential for completion or in situations of economic distress, may the DA, at their discretion, release milestone funds in advance.\n\nUpon completing KYC/KYB, grantees will have up to six months to complete their proposal. If they fail to do so, remaining funds will be retained by the program and either reassigned to new projects or, if the program has naturally concluded, returned to the DAO.\n\nUpon proposal completion, grantees must publish a final report in the Arbitrum forum to inform the general DAO community about their project.\n\nThree months after proposal completion, grantees must complete a survey and publish an update to their final report, aimed at tracking their success, foothold gained in Arbitrum, and adherence to or pivot from their original idea.\n\nBefore completion, a subset of projects will be internally selected by the PM and DAs for fast-tracking through a PM pitch into other ecosystem programs, such as the Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program or the GCP. While this won't necessarily guarantee further grants from these or other entities, it will ensure exceptional protocols can continue their journey and expand within the ecosystem.\n\nWith these modifications, several gaps from previous seasons are addressed:\n\n1. Creating a checkpoint for approved proposals after their final milestone: This will enable better overall tracking of project outcomes.\n2. Integrating exceptional projects into DAO growth programs to establish a clear pathway for continued development within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## Program phases\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibao77we73buy5735xsaeudsadh2j23rpkmclftijsgnwfgin2ndu)\n\nExcluding the initial phases of snapshot discussion, temp check on the proposal, candidacy for DAs, elections for DAs, and on-chain vote, the program is articulated in the following phases:\n1. A first 1 year phase: during these 12 months, funds allocated to the program will be assigned to DAs to the projects that will be evaluated as worth financing. During this phase, the green one in the graph, all the team will operate at full capacity.\n2. A second phase, at low capacity, lasting 6 months: this phase is also effectively already embedded in phase 1. During this 6 months we will assume that there won't be any new fund to distribute from the main phase, and it will be a monitoring one. As stated, grantees, once approved and kyced, will have *up to* 6 months to complete their project. This means that projects approved, for example, in the last legal month of phase 1, will be able to complete their path up to 6 months after the end of phase 1. In this period, the team will work at low capacity, with a 20% cost.\n3. A third phase, potentially extending up to 3 months after the end of phase 2, related to the checkmark of projects after completion. If we consider a project that gets approved in the last month of phase 1, and needs 6 months to arrive to completion (so is completed in the last month of phase 2), we will necessarily have to place the checkmark 9 months after the legal completion of phase 1. Note: there is no opex coverage for this phase, since is effectively based on contacting projects, interviewing them likely with a google form and report in the forum, but only as said for projects that were approved in the last quarter of phase 1 AND that requires 6 months for completion (which is not always the case). This phase will be covered through the team which will have the goodwill of finishing to accompany projects in their path, and could potentially be resolved through the passing of the baton to a new team, or confirmation of the old team, in a season 4.\n\nDuring all of these phases, there will be parallel communication phases related to\n- the communication and reporting of the program in the forum: we need to, indeed, cover this for 12 + 6 + 3 months of the program\n- the communication with Arbitrum Foundation: as stated, upon completion, best of breed projects will be pitched to the AF to have them continue their journey in the Arbitrum ecosystem, either through a grant, or marketing, or any other initiative that the AF might deem necessary, knowing that this internal pitch might not necessarily spark any follow up\n- the communication with GCP, in the same fashion of the AF, once the fund will have their thesis and infrastructure up\n- any communication with any other stakeholder or initiative that might be deemed relevant by the team or the DAO.\n\n## Domains\n\nSo far the program has run with four main domains:\n\n1. New Protocols and Ideas: A general bucket encompassing not only protocols, but also platforms, governance tooling, and other projects not specifically falling into other domains.\n2. Education, Community Growth and Events: A domain focused on physical events and educational material for Arbitrum.\n3. Dev Tooling on One and Nova: A technical domain oriented toward developer tooling and promoting Arbitrum Nova adoption.\n4. Gaming: A domain dedicated to web3 gaming and infra, web3 KOL gaming activities, and all video gaming-related projects.\n\nAll these domains remain pillars of our DAO today, even more so than a year ago. We are, for better or worse (though mostly better), the most accessible DAO in crypto, the first ecosystem to create a gaming fund of the size of GCP, and we have a technology stack that enables permissionless creation of L3s. Our ecosystem's nature and soul, combined with the entry-level grant structure of this program and the diversity we inevitably achieve through it, provides strong justification to maintain all four domains. While most operational changes will be in the framework that moves projects from this program to others, we plan to specify domains based on relevant stakeholders’ feedback (Arbitrum Foundation, OCL, Delegates) to add more specificity and better tailored results.\n\n### Education, Community Growth and Events\n\nThe domain has seen significant attention, receiving the highest number of proposals in both seasons. Through discussions with Foundation members and key stakeholders, two additional focus areas have emerged where the grant program can provide value:\n\nEvents Focus:\n\n* While continuing to serve the broader community, emphasis will be placed on amplifying Arbitrum's presence in key global markets and events\n* This will complement the Foundation's growth efforts in specific regions such as, in random order, SEA, USA, LatAm and others\n* The program will maintain an open approach, not limiting itself to these regions\n* Regular coordination with the Foundation's marketing department will help identify synergies between grantee proposals and events organized by the Foundation or other key ecosystem players\n* The DA will be mindful about any request of grantees for presence of personnel of the Arbitrum Foundation in the events: while this can, in some cases, be accommodated, is not always possible.\n\nDeveloper Relations:\n\n* Increased focus on DevRel content for both One and Stylus\n* Examples include, but are not limited to, video tutorials\n* Goal is to foster technology stack adoption through expanded community-created educational materials\n* This branch can partially overlap with and be covered/complemente by the Dev Tooling domain.\n\nTo reiterate: the domain won’t change its nature to only serve requests such as the one mentioned in the above examples, but might give in some cases more weights in the evaluation as there is value added in coordination with the broad ecosystem. The DA will still retain all its liberty of evaluation.\n\n### Gaming\n\nThe gaming vertical has gained increased attention throughout the year in Arbitrum, partly due to the GCP initiative. Key stakeholders, including OCL, have identified a primary need: Arbitrum Games should begin targeting the web2 gaming industry, creators and gamers.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the grantee budget cap of $50,000 isn't sufficient to attract web2 developers, we can broaden the domain's scope by focusing on user acquisition through initiatives such as:\n\n* Content creation for YouTube and TikTok\n* Twitch streams\n* Other KOL initiatives targeting the web2 gaming segment\n* Grant proposal tuned toward KPI such as amount of reach, target impressions and others\n* Independent publications like newsletters, blogs, and channels.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n* The domain, while expanding, will still maintain its existing focus, which is financing teams to bootstrap or expand web3 games, web3 game related infrastructure and web3 gaming services in the Arbitrum ecosystem while expanding to include these new initiatives\n* Success on the expanded scope will largely depend on selecting a strong candidate or team with specific experience and reach in this segment\n* These requirements will be reflected in the election criteria.\n\n### Dev Tooling on One and Stylus\n\nThe Dev Tooling will undergo changes based on what the Arbitrum ecosystem has achieved, both technologically and in terms of PMF, in the last 12 months.\n\nNova, initially included in the scope, hasn’t seen the forecasted adoption. At the same time we have seen a big conviction bet on Stylus.\n\nWhile it doesn’t make sense to exclude specifically Nova, it can’t be anymore one of the focus of the domain, which will be now called \"Dev Tooling on One and Stylus,\" incorporating the recent Stylus release. There shouldn’t be any consistent overlap with the current year-long \"Stylus Spring\" program for several reasons:\n\n* Different funding amounts (up to $50,000 in DA program vs. potentially $200-500,000 for Stylus Sprint)\n* Different application windows (always open in DA program vs. 8-weeks application period in Stylus Spring)\n* Broader scope (Dev Tooling domain will likely continue to primarily operate on Arbitrum One).\n\nThe rubric will also be modified to put emphasis on Telegram’s tooling such as trading bots, fairly available in other ecosystems but less widespread in Arbitrum.\n\n### New Protocols and Ideas\n\nThe \"New Protocols and Ideas\" domain will remain the most general capture-oriented domain, as it has been in the last two seasons. Its inherent generality enables it to cover both classic ideas, like financing DeFi protocols, and DAO-specific needs like governance tooling. This domain will remain largely unchanged, except for maintaining constant alignment with the Foundation and other stakeholders on what is considered important and valuable when assigning grants. Additionally, there will be attention paid to the evolving narratives driving the broader market.\n\n### Orbit Chains\n\nThere has been growing interest in a possible fifth domain related to Orbit chains. Many delegates have shown interest in or directly requested funding for an Orbit chains program, which is also supported by the existing [working group](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-as-the-home-of-builders-embracing-chain-abstraction/27250?u=jojo).\n\nThe Orbit Chains domain will have the mission to:\n\n* Enable Arbitrum protocols to expand their dApps to specific Orbit chains\n* Deploy technological solutions aimed at addressing current user experience fragmentation\n* Bootstrap solutions built on top of the [2024-2025 Offchain Labs roadmap](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/your-chain-your-rules-offchain-labs-technical-roadmap-to-fuel-arbitrum-innovation-f787f2e85966).\n\nThe Orbit chain domain won’t cover the deployment of new Orbit chains, since this is a mission that is currently facilitated by the Foundation. This doesn’t mean that a project can’t have, in its milestone, the deployment of its own chain if that is part of a broader plan; but this can’t be the main focus of the proposal.\n\nThe rubric and template will be drafted in detail with the elected team member, following the same process used for the other domain rubrics ([1](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66f2dec58868f5130ac75e42), [2](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32), [3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt), [4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)).\n\nAcknowledging that the DAO might consider it premature to launch an Orbit domain, particularly before seeing results from the related working group, the snapshot will provide an option to exclude it from the current program. This domain could then be integrated later during the program's one-year duration.\nAs for the current iteration, we propose [MaxLomu](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/maxlomu/summary) as lead for the Orbit domain. While we can accommodate the DAO's preference for elections in this domain, we believe there would be no better lead than him, given his background and current working group proposal.\n\n## Modularity\n\nSeveral parties have expressed interest in adding new domains to the DA program.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be wise to expand the program further at this time, new domains might be needed at different intervals, as illustrated by the Orbit domain example, where the DAO might require a new domain program six months from now. For this reason, Season 3 is designed to be modular.\n\nIf the DAO votes to allocate capital for a new domain, it can be integrated into the current program by leveraging the existing infrastructure and Program Manager. The costs for adding domains would vary based on specific implementation requirements:\n\n* For domains requiring no additional Questbook expansion and maintaining equivalent PM workload:\n  * Platform costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * PM costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * One new Domain Allocator required\n\nNote that:\n\n* New programs may operate with their own independent teams\n* Integration of the Orbit Chains domain, whether at the start of Season 3 or later, will not incur additional costs\n\n## What does success look like\n\nEvaluating success for an entry-level grant program can be challenging. The evaluation primarily focuses on three key metrics:\n\n1. **Number of Grant Applications**: The program has grown over the past two seasons with increased proposal submissions. We expect to maintain or exceed this level of interest. This KPI should be primarily compared to Season 2's metrics, as Season 1 had both lower funding and a lower cap ($25,000).\n2. **Grant Completion Rate**: As an entry-level program serving primarily small and new teams, the risk of incomplete projects is higher compared to more mature programs. The completion rate will largely depend on DAs' judgment in approving teams they trust to deliver. This metric should also be benchmarked against Season 2's performance for consistent comparison.\n3. **Long-term Project Sustainability**: A new metric will track how many teams are still building on their original project and remaining on Arbitrum three months after grant completion. As this is a new measurement not present in previous seasons, we won't have comparative data unless we retroactively measure Season 2 projects in nine months.\n\n## Election Process\n\nThe election process will follow established best practices as outlined in the [Code of Conduct](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2e701a942a8ed6f9ec8302cea866ab08648eeef0d07170814e3a3c3eb4e48415):\n\n* Two-week candidacy period\n* Candidates (person, entity or team) may apply for only one domain\n* Entities or Teams applying for any domain must designate a single individual as their point of contact\n* One-week snapshot election with shielded option enabled and weighted voting.\n\n## Resignation of DAs and PMs\n\nIn recognition that one year is a relatively long period for a DAO's program, procedures must be established for cases where team members cannot complete their tenure. If a member resigns, they will assist with the transition, and the team will attempt to source a replacement. A snapshot vote will be held with two options: \"Yes, proceed with the new member\" or \"No, hold elections.\"\n\nIf approved, the new member will be onboarded to the team. If rejected, a standard election process will occur over three weeks (two weeks for candidacy, one week for voting). During any transition period where the former member cannot fulfill their duties, the current DAs and PM will temporarily manage the domain, including grantee collaboration, proposal evaluation, and milestone payments. Any compensation due to the departing member during this interim phase will be fairly distributed among contributing team members.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe RFC will request $1,500,000 for each of the four domains \"New Protocols and Ideas\", \"Education, Community Growth and Events\", \"Dev Tooling on One and Nova\", and \"Gaming\", for a total amount of $6,000,000 excluding OpEx. The requested amount will be in ARB and, upon receiving, will be converted into USDC.\n\nEarmarked costs are as follows:\n\n* Questbook Platform: $84,000 total ($7,000/month for 12 months)\n  * Includes platform maintenance\n  * Synapse subscription for KYC/KYB of teams and grantees\n  * DocuSign subscription\n* Domain Allocator Compensation: $422,400 total\n  * $8,000/month for 12 months (four DAs)\n  * Plus $1,600/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n* Program Manager Compensation: $85,800 total\n  * $6,500/month for 12 months\n  * Plus $1,300/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n* Legal Expenses: $30,000 earmarked\n\nTotal operational costs: $622,200\n\nIf the Orbit Chains domain is added as a fifth domain:\n\n* Additional $750,000 to total budget\n* DA compensation of this domain remains unchanged\n* No additional PM or platform costs\n* Total program cost would increase to $727,800.\n\n*Note: If approved, JoJo will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2 at the start of Season 3. Similarly, if any of the current Domain Allocators will participate in the elections and will be re-elected, they will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2.*\n\n## Reporting\n\nA more clear and standardized reporting will take place going forward.

This will be used as a project buffer with funds either deployed in support of the program, recycled into ecosystem development or returned to Arbitrum DAO.\n\nSuccessful completion of these deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:\n\n* Number of active developers\n* Dev Github quality\n* Delegate engagement satisfaction\n* Voter participation\n* Capture-resistance\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**\n\n* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops\n* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way\n* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**\n\n* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows\n* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**\n\n* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**\n\n* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success\n* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “we can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs\n\nWithin web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.\n\n### Centralised Grants Program: Problems\n \n![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)\n    \n* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program\n* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.\n* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding\n* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to “open the door” for those who they know or have worked with before.h.\n\n### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems\n\n![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)\n    \n* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.\n* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas…\n* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.\n* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.\n* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.\n* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.\n\n### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds.\n\nAt its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\n![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)\n    \n> 💡The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n* Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n* Domain expertise and knowledge\n* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission\n* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling\n* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism\n* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n\nThis is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\n\nThis is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n![88d617338384427ed53607b929264bc8b623ef43_2_624x281.png](ipfs://bafkreiaylf4ugerhg5c755rx2ffjydpjcri6sx7mohjrafoiuylihkijfy)\n    \n### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.\n\nWeb3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n### Multisig Management\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.\n\n> 💡 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n### Team\n\nPlurality Labs Team\n\n**Disruption Joe**\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million.

In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\n\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.\n\nIf successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1.

    "summary": "The proposal to establish 'The Watchdog' grant misuse bounty program is recommended for approval due to strong timeline vote support, positive forum sentiment, and lessons from similar past proposals. It aims to incentivize the detection and reporting of misuse of DAO funds by rewarding whistleblowers and establishing a review committee. Despite some concerns about neutrality and KYC requirements, the overall sentiment and voting dynamics strongly favor the proposal.",
