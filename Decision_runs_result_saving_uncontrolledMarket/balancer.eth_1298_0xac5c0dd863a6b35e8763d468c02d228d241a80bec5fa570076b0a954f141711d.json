This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp Protocol. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs.\n>\n>\n>\n> Kelp has more than 185,000 ETH worth of assets restaked.\n>\n>\n>\n> By providing liquidity for the restaked positions, rsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n>\n>\n>\n> *KEP*\n>\n>\n>\n> KEP is a token representation of Kelp's EigenLayer Points, where 1 $KEP = 1 EL Point.\n>\n>\n>\n> Launch Details can be found [here](https://twitter.com/KelpDAO/status/1760722182869799390).\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Kelp is seeking to establish the KEP/rsETH on Balancer as the primary pool for KEP. This pool is expected to experience large trading volume by creating a secondary market for Kelp's EigenLayer Points.\n>\n>\n>\n> Liquidity Providers can expect to receive KEP as well as the normal BAL and AURA rewards.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:**\n>\n>\n>\n> * Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon.\n>\n>\n>\n> 2. **Oracles:**\n>\n>\n>\n> * rateProvider0 (for KEP): 0x0 (none)\n> * rateProvider1 (for rsETH): `0x746df66bc1bb361b9e8e2a794c299c3427976e6c`\n>\n>\n>\n> 3. **Audits:**\n>\n>\n>\n> * Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena.\n> * Sigma Prime Report: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/SigmaPrime.pdf\n> * Code4rena: [Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-11-kelp)\n>\n>\n>\n> 4. **Centralization vectors:**\n> Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n>\n>\n>\n> Our goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.\n>\n>\n>\n> 5. **Market History:**\n>\n>\n>\n> * KEP is to be launched 28th February 2024.\n> * rsETH represents more than 185,000 of restaked ETH and its trading history can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kelp-dao-restaked-eth).\n>\n>\n>\n> 6. **Value:**\n>\n>\n>\n> * This pool is a Core Pool and therefore will generate revenue for the DAO via rsETH derived yield and from the 1% swap fee.\n\n**Pool Details**\n\n> Link to Pool: [0xFf42A9AF956617e4C3532eF2fC7567465EFE4909](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xff42a9af956617e4c3532ef2fc7567465efe4909000200000000000000000672)\n> Link to Gauges: [0xc6b65bc6bF4a5fF4D90fDf7f568cBF8C99419DA1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6b65bc6bF4a5fF4D90fDf7f568cBF8C99419DA1)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xc6b65bc6bF4a5fF4D90fDf7f568cBF8C99419DA1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
