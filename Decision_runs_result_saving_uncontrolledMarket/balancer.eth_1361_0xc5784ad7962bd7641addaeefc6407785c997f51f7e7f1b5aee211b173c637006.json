        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/844\n\n**Summary:**\n> This is a proposal on behalf of GenesisLRT to enable a gauge for genETH/wstETH on Ethereum. genETH is Genesis' Restaked Token, obtained through GenesisLRT’s restaking mechanism and platform.\nGenesisLRT offers a revolutionary process called 'Restaking' that supercharges users’\nETH by enabling them to stake their ETH on not just one, but multiple networks at once,\nthereby maximizing their rewards.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website: https://www.genesislrt.com/\n    • Documentation: https://docs.genesislrt.com/\n    • Github Page: https://github.com/genesislrt/contracts\n    • Communities: https://twitter.com/Genesis_LRT, Discord: https://discord.com/invite/DCTWmhgBXr\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> GenesisLRT offers a revolutionary process called 'Restaking' that supercharges users’\nETH by enabling them to stake their ETH on not just one, but multiple networks at once,\nthereby maximizing their rewards. It applies a novel concept called “EigenLayer” to\nempower users to restake their assets, whether it’s pure ETH or liquid staking tokens\n(LSTs) from their existing stake. This not only earns them extra profits but also bolsters\nthe security of the network. Additionally, Genesis allows users to unlock the restaked\nliquidity with the liquid restaked token genETH.\n\n>With Genesis, users will have the possibility to have a customizable restaking\nexperience by being able to choose his or her operators, validators and AVSs (Actively\nValidated Service). Genesis will ensure that the user will always have the best\nexperience and yields available in the market.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> GenesisLRT aims to enable a gauge for genETH/wstETH to substantially increase the liquidity of genETH, while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** \n- Delegate Voting: Participate in the selection of the best EigenLayerLs Node Operators to boost rewards on restaked assets, and general protocol governance. \n- Choosing validators, operators and AVSs involved in the Restaking process and their respective delegation strategy.\n- The more votes a pool gets, the more JEN token rewards\nwill be allocated to it_ the more TVL a pool gets, the more JEN token rewards will be\nallocated to it.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Still to be deployed. Rate provider - [genETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf073bac22dab7faf4a3dd6c6189a70d54110525c#code)\n\n3. **Audits:** GenesisLRT undergoes security audits and checks to ensure the safety of user funds. Latest by Veridise: [Audit](https://www.genesislrt.com/assets/files/VAR_GenesisLRT_231221-V1.pdf)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** The GenesisLRT Litepaper introduced the vision for Genesis as a decentralized system where independent node operators work to power the growth and development of Web3. Further detailed information may be found here: [Genesis - EigenLayer Docs](https://docs.genesislrt.com/introduction/eigenlayer)\n\n5. **Market History:** No major volatility - [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/genesislrt-restaked-eth)\n \n6. **Value:** The pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for genETH on Ethereum and allow for a healthy stimulation of volume.\n\nPool address: [0x6AA5a6b9257CA6e18b2da94e1a5FbE57ce2947cA](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x6aa5a6b9257ca6e18b2da94e1a5fbe57ce2947ca00000000000000000000067b)\nGauge address: [0x7d631e72eb15285Da57eeaf40a971724A94ced05](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d631e72eb15285Da57eeaf40a971724A94ced05#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x7d631e72eb15285Da57eeaf40a971724A94ced05`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

The BAL gauge will facilitate the process.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** FRAX governance process can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/smart-contracts/governance) and their snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth).\n2. **Oracles:** Rate provider contract for [sfrxETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf752dd899F87a91370C1C8ac1488Aef6be687505), the pool does not rely on additional oracles.\n3. **Audits:** See [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits)\n4. **Centralization vectors:** see [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/overview).\n5. **Market History:** See [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on interest bearing sfrxETH in the pool and so will LPs.

Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens (iLRTs) for each restaked LST. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website: https://www.inceptionlrt.com/\n    • Documentation: https://docs.inceptionlrt.com/\n    • Github Page: https://github.com/inceptionlrt/smart-contracts/tree/master\n    • Communities: https://twitter.com/InceptionLRT, Discord: https://discord.com/invite/gBswunawAn\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> InceptionLRT is an isolated Liquid Restaking protocol for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), enabling the restaking of various LSTs with the initial focus on stETH and rETH. Its core feature is the issuance of Isolated Liquid Restaking Tokens (iLRTs) for each restaked LST. \nThese iLRTs can be freely traded and used in other DeFi protocols while maintaining segregation from the underlying LSTs. This architecture addresses potential risks associated with basket-based LRTs like increased complexity, counterparty risk, and often unclear pool rebalancing rules.\nInceptionLRT is specifically designed to bolster the EigenLayer framework by addressing a critical challenge: the issue of liquidity locking in the protocol. This advancement positions InceptionLRT as a key player in enhancing the fluidity and accessibility of restaking in the DeFi landscape.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> InceptionLRT aims to enable a gauge for instETH/wstETH to substantially increase the liquidity of instETH, while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n>1. **Governance:** ING holders participate in decision-making, influencing the protocol’s direction and policies, including the Node Operators, AVSs and restaking strategies.\nIncentive Allocation: Through gauge weight voting, veING holders direct incentives and rewards towards preferred liquidity, impacting the protocol's dynamics.\nRewards and Participation: Providing ING to liquidity pools like the 80-20 Balancer Liquidity Pools and locking the LP token earns veING, granting access to various protocol.\n>2. **Oracles:** Rate Provider for [instETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x343281bb5029c4b698fe736d800115ac64d5de39#readContract).\n>3. **Audits:** InceptionLRT undergoes security audits and checks to ensure the safety of user funds.

The BAL gauge and core pool status will facilitate the process.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** FRAX governance process can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/smart-contracts/governance) and their snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth).\n2. **Oracles:** Rate provider contract for [sfrxETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf752dd899F87a91370C1C8ac1488Aef6be687505) and for [sFRAX](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xDe3B7eC86B67B05D312ac8FD935B6F59836F2c41).\n3. **Audits:** See [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits)\n4. **Centralization vectors:** see [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/overview).\n5. **Market History:** See [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on interest bearing sFRAX and sfrxETH in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.\n\nLink to pool: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x2feb76966459d7841fa8a7ed0aa4bf574d6111bf00020000000000000000011d\nLink to child gauge: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x758D3297d9D9325EFb6DD424a7B2EdCaB47e309E\nLink to root gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c596E8D1b3Be04a6cAa1B1152b51c495f799a16#code\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x8c596E8D1b3Be04a6cAa1B1152b51c495f799a16`\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`\n\nAdditionally, this pool is requesting `core pool` status as per BIP-457",
