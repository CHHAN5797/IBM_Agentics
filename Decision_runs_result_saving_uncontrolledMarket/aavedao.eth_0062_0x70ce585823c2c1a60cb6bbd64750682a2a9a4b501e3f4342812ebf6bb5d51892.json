        "body": "## **Author: LlamaRisk**\n\n## **Date: 2024-10-02**\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nWe'll keep this short. When we [initially applied](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-llamarisk-as-aave-risk-service-provider) to serve Aave as a risk service provider, our primary goal was to deliver complementary and collaborative work alongside @ChaosLabs, focusing on qualitative analysis, ad hoc research, and legal/regulatory advisory.\n\nFive months later, we are confident that we have fulfilled this commitment, a sentiment that numerous delegates and service providers have echoed. Our work has made a significant impact on safely integrating newly onboarded assets, and we have fostered a great relationship with @ChaosLabs, holding regular meetings, aligning internally, and driving informed decisions. We place high importance on furthering the common mission of all Aave service providers to promote sustainable growth of the protocol, and to that end we have engaged in collaborations and taken steps to join task forces with numerous ecosystem teams.\n\nAlthough most of our work is publicly available through [monthly community updates](https://governance.aave.com/t/llamarisk-monthly-community-update/), we have made several positive contributions behind the scenes. These include advocating for bug bounty programs, improved access controls, and increased transparency for end users. A good example of such activity is our work behind the scenes on WBTC to ensure sensible and compliant steps in its custody restructuring partnership with BiT Global. This presented LlamaRisk an opportunity to showcase its expertise in evaluating regulatory risk and to diplomatically navigate a sensitive situation to protect the interests of Aave and its users.\n\nOur staged onboarding plan has allowed us to manage the allocated budget prudently, with a steady increase in workforce and dedicated resources to Aave. As a reminder, LlamaRisk is a community-led, non-profit organization that aligns with Aave in making the protocol as secure and resilient as possible to bolster its capacity for sustainable growth. All funds are directed towards contributor compensation and infra expenses related to Aave.\n\n## Scope\n\nAs we enter the next engagement phase, we request a six month engagement for a total of $400,000, to be paid either in GHO or aToken stables, at the DAO's discretion. While this represents a 60% increase over our initial budget, it amounts to a marginal increase from our current burn rate, which we have prudently managed as we've expanded our team and substantially increased our contributions to AAVE DAO. The total amount requested for the engagement is  in addition to continuing our current scope, we plan to extend the following services to the Aave DAO:\n\n* **Risk Monitoring**: Liquidity depth monitoring and markets exposure analysis for Aave markets will aid our ad hoc research efforts and inform our team about concerning liquidity trends and inconsistencies in Aave's exposure between individual assets and asset categories. As with all our research and analysis, we will make Aave markets liquidity data and analysis public through an Aave risk portal dashboard for the benefit of DAO contributors and Aave users. This will also allow us to better collaborate with Chaos Labs to identify and proactively respond to evolving market conditions. \n* **Probationary Onboarding Framework**: Typically an asset risk review is conducted prior to onboarding, but especially since Aave may seek to onboard assets with a short history for strategic reasons, an extended 2-month probation period is prudent. LlamaRisk will define and implement a framework for probationary asset offboarding for cases where assets are not satisfying market health and growth expectations. Establishing clear guidelines will also serve protocol teams in setting targets and aligning expectations.\n* **Chain Ecosystem Framework**: While BGD Labs can devote resources toward evaluating chain deployments from a security and technical perspective, LlamaRisk can supplement evaluations from an economic perspective. Our Chain Evaluation Framework will detail available DeFi applications, user behaviors, and ecosystem-wide assets review to identify the market risk associated with the proposed chain deployment. The framework guidelines will benefit chain candidates through the establishment of clear expectations around building liquidity and an ecosystem that is minimally eligible for Aave.\n* **RWA Integrations**: RWAs present an integration challenge and an opportunity to cross the divide between DeFi and TradFi. The challenges mainly revolve around regulatory hurdles and specialized design requirements to satisfy those limitations. We are leveraging our regulatory expertise in collaboration with Chainlink to develop standards for RWA integrations that are compliant and scalable to meet the requirements of the numerous RWAs coming to market. This will involve research into legal structures (including BORGs) to facilitate such integrations.\n* **Legal Research**: Focusing on the MiCA treatment of governance tokens, with a specific emphasis on the amended features of AAVE following the AAVEnomics update. We intend to draft a comprehensive report that will delve into the legal implications of these changes. Additionally, we will closely monitor the mandatory ESMA/EBA guidance issued under MiCA and are committed to producing concise briefs that outline their implications for the AAVE token.\n\nAs all indicators suggest that Aave is entering a new growth phase, we wish to continue bringing value as an independent, pragmatic, and stabilizing voice within the DAO. Many of the brightest minds in our industry serve the Aave DAO; we are enthusiastic about being among your ranks and look forward to growth and ongoing collaboration with all of you.\n\n## Specification\n\nCreate a payment stream of $400,000, either in GHO or aToken stables, to the address `0xE8555F05b3f5a1F4566CD7da98c4e5F195258B65`, a LlamaRisk controlled multisig, for 6 months starting from the end of the previous engagement (Oct 28th, 2024 / block 1730098043)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nLlamaRisk is presenting this ARFC independently and is not compensated by any third party for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Author: Certora\n\n## Date: 2024-20-09\n\n----------\n\n# Summary\n\nWith 2.5 years of continuous collaboration and contribution to Aave’s ecosystem behind us, we’re as excited about the protocol's future as we were on day one!\n\nWe offer an extension of our engagement with the DAO for a total period of 12 months. The scope of our offering is divided into 2 parts for transparency on pricing and operational commitment:\n\n1. Extending the [existing services](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-continuous-security-proposal-aave-certora/15732) for Aave V3, which include:\n\n  1. A full-time dedicated team available to consult, research, and review maintenance work, and new developments.\n  2. Full ownership over governance proposal reviews - reviewing every governance proposal initiated on-chain.\n  3. 24/7 availability for incident response, supporting the technical providers in the investigation and mitigation of emerging bugs.\n\nNote that the scope includes all existing V3 instances and all future EVM-based V3 instances.\n\nThe price for the above scope is $1.7M. ⅔ of the price, $1.15M, will be made in Gho and ⅓, $0.55M, in AAVE.\n\n2. Safeguarding transactions against unknown attacks\n\n  1. We will develop Safeguard, a modified Ethereum client based on geth client for real-time monitoring and invariant checking for Aave V3.\n  2. We will write and monitor the invariants in real time to add another layer of security to the protocol and collaborate with the relevant entities to investigate and mitigate any suspicious transactions.\n\nNote that Safeguard is a complementary security service we provide free of charge for all existing AAVE V3 instances and all future EVM-based V3 instances.\n\nPrice Explanation\n\nLast year, we reduced our prices from $2.7M to $1.5M to reflect the bear market. This year, we suggest a small increase to cover the rise in our costs.\n\nOur regular annual price for professional services is $2.7M. We decided to reduce the price by 37% to $1.7M, to reflect our commitment to Aave’s security.\n\nAs in previous years, we request a ⅔-⅓ price breakdown of stablecoin and AAVE, respectively. As service providers and DAO members, we are strong believers in the alignment of long-term players with the protocol. Over the years, not a single AAVE token we received was sold, and the governance power was put to work through delegation to both ACI and StableLabs, which we track closely.\n\n# Background and Motivation\n\nIn March 2022, we presented [a proposal to serve as a DAO security provider](https://governance.aave.com/t/continuous-formal-verification/6308?u=certora), collaborating with the other technical contributors to help Aave deploy the finest and most secure product on the market. In the next six months, we collaborated with both BGD Labs and Aave Labs on several high-profile projects, including the AAVE token V3, governance cross-chain bridge, and Gho token.\n\nSince then, we have continuously served the DAO as a security provider, assisting with dozens of new feature deployments and protocol improvement upgrades ([Sept 2022 - Sept 2023](https://governance.aave.com/t/security-and-agility-of-aave-smart-contracts-via-continuous-formal-verification/10181/19?u=certora), [Sept 2023 - Sept 24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RoJPYxxf_9MAlJ6hWdl5JRHHwMW8aXGjTBGX2c3PQv0/edit?usp=sharing)), preventing several critical bugs from going live and assisting with mitigation of live bugs upon emergence.\n\nIn addition to conducting security reviews and formal verification, we also:\n\n1. Conducted several focused research and investigation efforts of components and features within the ecosystem, reporting to the developing entities about the results and recommending actions to be taken.\n2. Led 6 community efforts to review and formally verify new and existing Aave code. This included extensive education of the independent researchers community on the protocol and ecosystem as a whole.\n3. Took full ownership of on-chain governance proposal reviews, reviewing so far 153 proposals, finding 4 bugs since February.\n\n  1. We’re also continuously working with BGD Labs to improve their AIP review tooling - [Seatbelt](https://github.com/bgd-labs/seatbelt-gov-v3).\n  2. In addition to developing a complementary tool that helps highlight potential failure points and ensure the robustness of the layered review process.\n\n4. Assist with incident response investigations and mitigations.\n5. Following successful voting, on August 2024 we admitted our roles as signers for both the governance guardian and protocol emergency guardian.\n\n  1. We will continue to act in full trust of the DAO and in collaboration with the rest of the contributing parties to train and act according to the DAO’s best interest.\n\nWith the current engagement coming to an end, we propose our services for the fourth time, offering new contribution channels to the ecosystem in addition to the existing ones.\n\n# Scope\n\nWe present the suggested scope for the following year:\n\n* Year-round availability of a dedicated team for review of new code. This includes manual reviews and [formal verification](https://medium.com/certora/certora-technology-white-paper-cae5ab0bdf1) of smart contracts, as well as the use of additional tools as necessary.\n\n* 24/7 availability for incident response investigations and mitigation. Of course, this is in full collaboration with the relevant developing entities and BGD Labs, the DAO's security coordinator.\n\n* Full responsibility for reviewing every AIP that goes on-chain, preventing any faulty or malicious proposals from being executed and ensuring the highest-standard procedures are met.\n\n* We will develop an invariant-based monitoring system, called Safeguard, with invariants specifically tailored for Aave. The invariants will be written by Certora, assisted by BGD Labs for Aave V3 related components and Aave Labs for Gho related components. Alerts, results and data will be shared with BGD Labs as the system’s security coordinators.\n  * Since development is still in the early stages and it’s still undetermined when Safeguard will be up and running in stable form, bringing value to the DAO, we offer this at no additional cost on a best-effort basis.\n* We will continue to develop our governance proposals review tool to improve the overall tooling for the DAO in this domain.\nThe tool is currently in an alpha version and used solely by Certora. However, on December 1st, we’re expecting to release a beta version to the other service providers to get their feedback and feature requests. In a later stage, we plan to release the tool for public use.\n\nThe annual price for the project is $1.7M: $1.15M is paid in Gho vested linearly over one year, and $550,000 is paid in AAVE tokens vested linearly over one year. A 30-day termination is possible after a vote.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe payload will create 2 payment streams to the address 0x0F11640BF66e2D9352d9c41434A5C6E597c5e4c8 for a duration of 365 days starting from the end of the previous engagement (Sept. 11, 2024).\n\n* Create a payment stream of $1.15M Gho to 0x0F11640BF66e2D9352d9c41434A5C6E597c5e4c8 for a total of 365-Delta days.\n* Create a payment stream of $0.55M worth of AAVE to 0x0F11640BF66e2D9352d9c41434A5C6E597c5e4c8 for a total of 365-Delta days.\n\nWhere Delta is the number of days from September 11th until execution.\n\nPrice of AAVE will be determined using a 30-days average.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nCertora is presenting this ARFC independently and is not compensated by any third party for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Author: Chaos Labs\n\n## Date: 2024-10-04\n\n----------\n# Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes to renew our engagement with the Aave DAO. We will provide our full suite of risk management products and services, covering all of Aave, including V2, V3, and GHO, across all current and future deployments.\n\nOur current annual engagement is set to end on November 13th, 2024.\n\n# **Background**\n\nIn November 2022, Chaos Labs formally joined the Aave DAO as a service provider specializing in risk management and parameter optimization. \n\nDuring this time, we have consistently demonstrated our unwavering dedication to the DAO, covering all aspects of the protocol across all deployments and providing the community with proactive risk parameter recommendations alongside reactive analyses and risk-mitigating strategies in light of significant market events. Chaos Labs has initiated over 230 ARFCs and posts, and actively engaged with more than 770 posts, including parameter optimization, onboarding of new assets and new deployments, deprecation of V2 and migration to V3, GHO growth, and community support during major market events.\n\nThroughout our engagement, the protocol incurred minimal bad debt, even during significant market events, including those on August 6, 2024, which resulted in zero bad debt.\n\n💡 A comprehensive summary of Chaos Labs’ activities over the past contract year is available in our monthly community updates here.

Our methodologies are rooted in an integrative approach, offering protocol robustness and protecting funds from market risks through dynamic risk parameter recommendations. We provide a holistic approach encompassing software and services to mitigate risks in volatile markets, countering economic attacks on the protocol and ensuring the secure preservation of user funds.\n\n## Scope\n\n### **Risk Parameter Optimization**\n\nUsing our state-of-the-art risk simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a highly skilled team of data scientists and researchers, we deliver in-depth analyses and strategic recommendations for optimizing risk parameters. Our cutting-edge simulations utilize real-time protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to rigorously stress-test the protocol, uncovering potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for enhancement. This advanced approach provides a detailed understanding of the factors influencing protocol health and stability, enabling us to offer data-driven recommendations that maximize protocol revenue while safeguarding user funds and mitigating risks.\n\nOur coverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.\n\n### **Risk Oracles**\n\nEnhance the capabilities of Edge Risk Oracles, developed by Chaos Labs, to better meet Aave's specific requirements, enabling more efficient and dynamic adjustments to risk parameters. This will streamline the risk management process, minimize the need for manual interventions, and significantly improve the protocol's operational efficiency and security.\n\nCurrently, this initiative is under [governance review](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-generalized-risk-stewards-agrs-activation/19178) for the Lido Instance, with plans to expand coverage to additional parameters and deployments in the future.\n\nAs part of this initiative, we will enhance our product by introducing a dashboard that monitors Risk Oracle updates, enabling the community to track historical changes and assess the impact of parameter optimizations over time.\n\n### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWe offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol’s health.\n\nAs part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.\n \n![ff4cb055395f8634be7c381a29e3f8016a5c65cc.png](ipfs://bafybeig7ommgsbubnp7vwr6qvruoxey7252powzpruxmkmbrzxxfkuzray)\n    \n### Risk Stewards and Guardians\n\nWe act as Risk Stewards, carefully managing risk while adjusting supply and borrow caps according to predefined rules. This enables us to continually raise caps, fostering protocol growth without compromising safety. A current [governance proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-generalized-risk-stewards-agrs-activation/19178) aims to expand the Risk Stewards' authority to encompass a broader range of risk parameters, allowing for more agile and timely adjustments based on market conditions. Additionally, we serve as signers on the Aave Protocol Guardians, ensuring protocol security in critical situations, and as GHO Stewards.\n\n### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3\n\nChaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the ‘Background’ section.\n\nAs we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2.\n\nGiven the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.\n\n### **Protocol Growth**\n\nChaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n\nAs we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol’s expansion and sustainability.\n\n### GHO\n\nChaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:\n\n- **Parameter Optimization** - We will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals.\n- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics** - We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.\n- **Facilitator’s Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - We will continue to enhance our risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.\n\n# Chaos Team Support\n\nAs part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.\n\nOur team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response. In the event of any incidents or issues, our team will be on hand to provide timely and effective incident response, minimizing the potential impact on the protocol and its users.\n\n**Ongoing and Proactive Risk Management**\n\nThis includes detailed analyses of new asset onboarding, assessing the potential risks and benefits of launching in new markets, and providing a thorough understanding of parameter recommendations, including qualitative data and position analysis.\n\n**Incident Response**\n\nThis includes supporting various events, including liquidity changes, asset depegs, price volatilities, etc. Our team provides ongoing support in these events, including market monitoring and alerting, ad-hoc risk analysis, and recommendations on risk-mitigating actions.\n\nOur team of experts brings a wealth of experience in risk management and data analysis, enabling us to provide the insights and recommendations necessary to navigate even the most challenging market conditions. By working closely with the community, we can provide the support and guidance necessary to promote Aave’s long-term success and sustainability.\n\n# Communications:\n\n- Our team will share our recommendations and analyses through dedicated governance forum discussions, maintaining transparency and facilitating effective communication with the community.\n- We commit to providing a monthly update post, highlighting completed work and outlining our future focus areas.\n- We are consistently available for community calls and regularly schedule check-up calls with Aave delegates. These calls primarily focus on addressing risk-related inquiries, offering insights into existing proposals, and gathering general feedback.\n\n# Terms\n\n- 12-month engagement, November 13th 2024-November 13th, 2025\n- $2M, streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n    - $1,000,000 in GHO\n    - $1,000,000 in aUSDT\n\n# Specification:\n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (`0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0`) as the recipient.\n\nRegarding technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 1,000,000 aUSDT and 1,000,000 GHO for a 12-month duration.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Gearbox, and more. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, we are targeting a Snapshot vote.\n2.

        "body": "![IMG_4368](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkHeXxqNkg.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nTokenLogic proposes to renew our engagement with the Aave DAO  for 1 year from the 15th December 2024 when our current stream ends.\n\nTokenLogic is to provide the following services to the DAO. \n\n- Treasury and Runway Management;\n- Analytics and Performance Metrics;\n- GHO's growth across DeFi and CeFi; and,\n- Support Aave protocol parameter optimisation.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## What to Expect\n\n### Treasury and Runway Management\n\n**Asset Management & Financial Security**\n\nA central area of focus for the Finance Services Provider is to ensure that the DAO’s expenses and strategic initiatives are funded efficiently and without delay. Through the Steward role, or the standard governance process when required, TokenLogic will prioritize maintaining the DAO’s financial stability by ensuring a runway that exceeds six months of its burn rate while optimizing capital efficiency.\n\nKey components of this objective include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds across networks;\n* Providing AAVE & GHO Protocol-Owned-Liquidity (POL);\n* Allocating assets for capital efficiency, integrating yield bearing assets to the treasury;\n* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3, and between Aave v3 markets;\n* Swapping assets to align expenses with holdings.\n\n### Analytics and Performance metrics\n\nTokenLogic is establishing itself as the definitive hub for all Aave Protocol and GHO-related data via the [Aave Portal](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/). This initiative will be continuously developed and expanded throughout the year, providing access to key metrics on protocol performance, health, GHO dynamics, and market analysis.\n\nTransparency, analytics, and reporting are at the core of this effort, ensuring a clear understanding of the protocol’s financial status and overall performance. The Aave Portal will serve as an important tool for informed decision-making and in-depth analysis of the Aave ecosystem.\n\nTo further engage and educate the community, this initiative will be complemented by detailed threads/articles released throughout the mandate, promoting awareness and understanding of the platform’s developments.\n\n### GHO Adoption\n\n**Oversight**\n\nThe year 2025 will mark the second year of GHO, solidifying its strength and utility within the ecosystem. This milestone year is set to be a pivotal period of expansion for GHO, as it continues to expand to other networks and remains a cornerstone of the protocol’s revenue model.\n\nAs GHO Stewards, TokenLogic will oversee critical configurations, including the Borrow Rate, GSM Caps and Fees, ensuring optimal functionality and sustainability. In our role as Treasury Managers, we will strategically manage GHO swaps to maintain a robust and stable peg, reinforcing GHO’s position as a key asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nWe will continue to spearhead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), with a primary focus on managing liquidity, introducing POL from the Treasury, coordination GHO's launch on other networks (excl. Gnosis) and driving integrations across diverse protocols.\n\nOur key responsibilities include:\n\n- Strategically adjusting liquidity incentives to ensure robust market depth;\n- Designing and implementing direct liquidity incentive programs;\n- Leading initiatives to enhance GHO’s utility and adoption;\n- Optimizing the deployment of the DAO’s strategic voting assets;\n- Supporting future GHO facilitator programs;\n- Deploying aToken GSMs;\n- Deploying GHO liquidity from the Treasury;\n- Facilitating GHO integration into centralized exchanges, fund management platforms, and the broader DeFi ecosystem; and,\n- Support teams seeking to attain a line of credit within the upcoming Emergence instance.\n\n**Parameter Configuration**\n\nTokenLogic will continue to provide detailed insights into GHO's performance and provide parameter recommendations that prioritise price stability whilst balancing the DAO's growth ambitions. \n\nStrategic focus will be placed on managing the borrow rate and peg relationship to maintain the resilience of the peg by retaining funds within the GSMs, whilst promoting the ongoing use of GHO within evolving market dynamics.\n\nThe Aave Portal will provide insights into the impact of the parameter adjustments to curate an environment that promotes sustainable growth, adoption and aligns with Aave's broader financial goals. \n\nThe TokenLogic team will collaborate closely with other service providers to create balanced, effective solutions that benefit the protocol as a whole.\n\n### Aave Protocol\n\nThe evolution of the Aave protocol, including updates to Aave v4, the deployment of Umbrella, and the launch of new Aave markets, will bring transformative changes to the protocol’s operations. Our proposal focuses on providing the financial planning and management essential for navigating these developments and ensuring smooth integration within the broader ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, we will support the adaptation of Aave’s tokenomics to meet the requirements of Umbrella and the introduction of new staking pools. Through proactive collaboration, strategic guidance, and consultation, we are committed to ensuring these updates are implemented seamlessly and positioned for long-term success.\n\n# Terms\n\n* 12-month engagement, December 15th 2024 to December 15th 2025; and,\n* 1,000,000 GHO streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n\n# Specification\n\nTo support funding the streams, the following is to be performed:\n\n* 0.75M GHO deposited Prime instance;\n* 0.75M aEthUSDC swapped to GHO; and,\n* GHO from swap sent to Treasury.\n\nCreate the following stream allowing TokenLogic to withdraw GHO from the Prime instance.\n\nStream: 1,000,000 GHO over 365 days\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nThe stream shall commence the next block from when the previous stream finishes.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond the Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic does provide data analytics services to Gearbox. This commitment does not interfere with our responsibilities to the Aave DAO. \n\nWe conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $2M.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn November 2023, Chaos Labs’ engagement with Aave DAO was [unanimously renewed](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/360/), underscoring our ongoing commitment and the expanded scope of our engagement with Aave, which has evolved significantly with Aave's expansion now across over 10 deployments.\n\nThis renewal was done during the bear market, prompting us to propose a community-friendly deal at a lower-than-market cost, given the challenging market conditions and being mindful of the broader economic environment. This was aligned with the feedback from major Aave stakeholders and delegates. However, the expansion of Aave to multiple chains, in addition to the increased volatility and activity across DeFi and crypto, has significantly increased our scope and workload, necessitating additional resources to maintain the high level of service required. \n\nAs dedicated risk contributors, Chaos Labs adopts a holistic approach to managing the spectrum of responsibilities within Aave's ecosystem, including V3, GHO, and the continued offboarding of V2. Our commitment encompasses risk management, data science, analytics, and parameter recommendation, among other critical functions. An amendment to our compensation is essential to reflect better the resources committed, the depth of our engagement, and the substantial value we bring to the Aave community.\n\nConsidering improved market conditions and Aave’s growth over the past several months, we believe the DAO is now in a position to revise our compensation to more accurately reflect the current scale and impact of our engagement and allocated resources.\n\n### Enhancing Aave's Risk Management Framework\n\nThe proposed compensation amendment is not merely a financial adjustment but a continued investment in our collaboration. With additional funding, Chaos Labs will be poised to:\n\n- **Deploy Additional Resources:** Enhance support for existing and future Aave markets, ensuring comprehensive risk management across all deployments.\n- **Develop and Optimize Risk Oracles:** Focus efforts on the continued development of the Chaos Risk Oracle specifically for Aave’s needs, enabling more efficient and dynamic risk parameter adjustments. This will further streamline the risk management process, reducing the need for manual interventions and significantly boosting the protocol's operational efficiency and security.\n- **Expansion of Risk Monitoring and Alerts:** Our real-time monitoring and alert services are delivered via the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). We're committed to enriching these services with more comprehensive analytics and alerts, enhancing visibility and enabling users to meticulously evaluate ecosystem risks and the health of the protocol through intuitive dashboards and data visualizations. The deployment of Risk Oracles will introduce additional data, providing the community with an improved grasp of risk levels and updates to protocol parameters.\n\n### Collaborative Expansion with a Second Risk Service Provider\n\nFollowing Gauntlet's resignation as the second-risk service provider, we strongly support the idea of bringing on another service provider to complement our existing scope of work. As part of our engagement, we are committed to dedicating the required resources to assist with the onboarding process and ongoing collaborations, ensuring a seamless integration that enhances Aave's risk management capabilities without duplicating efforts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe requested compensation amendment is key for Chaos Labs to sustain and expand its support for Aave. It will enable us to allocate additional resources effectively, develop innovative solutions like the Risk Oracle, and continue our mission to enhance Aave's security and efficiency. We are committed to our partnership with Aave and believe that with the community's support, we can continue setting the standards for risk management in the industry.\n\n## Specification:\n\nWe request an additional $400K for the remainder of our current engagement, bringing the total annual compensation to $2M. \n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 400,000 aUSDC or GHO. \n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and more. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP).\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
