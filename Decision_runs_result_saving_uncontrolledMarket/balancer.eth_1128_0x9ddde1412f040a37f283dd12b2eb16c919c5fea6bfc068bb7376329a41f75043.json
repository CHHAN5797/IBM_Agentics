After over a year of development and testing, the V3 upgrade is now live on Mainnet. StakeWise V3 is the (Gnosis) Safe of ETH staking, a free public good that aims to fully democratize the staking ecosystem and greatly improve the decentralisation of staked capital. Any entity can offer trustless, non-custodial staking-as-a-service via an open marketplace that gives stakers the ability to delegate to their preferred operators/staking solutions. For more details about StakeWise V3, please refer to the [StakeWise V3 Announcement](https://stakewise.medium.com/stakewise-v3-announcement-9e4fe73abdf2).\n\nStakeWise V3 features a liquid staking token, osETH, that any staker can mint to access DeFi. osETH minting is optional and can be done on-demand, for times when a liquid staking token is needed. The liquidity and integrations for osETH are provided by StakeWise DAO, creating a ready-made liquid staking ecosystem for any operator to plug into. The osETH token has in-built slashing protection due to its overcollateralisation and accrues yield from a highly diverse set of node operators. osETH is a new token that is launching with StakeWise V3 and, consequently, there is no historical price data to refer to.\n\nThe protocol is governed by StakeWise DAO, a [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) DAO with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n## Motivation\n\nosETH will be the main LST for StakeWise moving forward and the osETH-ETH Balancer pool will be the primary liquidity venue. A gauge is necessary to help bootstrap the pool’s TVL.\n\n## Specifications\n\n**1. Governance** \nThe StakeWise DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token. The majority of the protocol’s smart contracts are immutable (incl. osETH). Contracts that are upgradable require a successful DAO vote followed by the approval of a Vault admin/owner to ensure users of the protocol retain full control over contract upgradeability.\n\n**2. Oracles** \nStakeWise relies on an Oracle network to accurately report validator balances to the protocol smart contracts. StakeWise has 11 leading commercial operators all acting under SLAs to ensure the Network runs efficiently (more information can be found [here](https://docs-v3.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oracles)).\n\n**3. Audits** \nHalborn and Sigma Prime ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)), alongside a public audit competition hosted by [Hats Finance](https://twitter.com/HatsFinance/status/1712166174459347001).\n\n**4. Centralization vectors**\nNo, both the StakeWise DAO and the Oracle network are decentralised.\n\n**5. Market History**\nNone, osETH is a newly deployed token.\n[Balancer pool link](https://app.balancer.fi/#/1/pool/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635)\n[Gauge link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc592c33e51A764B94DB0702D8BAf4035eD577aED)\n\n**6. Value**\nThis new Balancer pool will be the primary source of liquidity for the token.\n\n**Note:** The owner of the Pool is set to Balancer DAO and the Yield Protocol Fee has been disabled on this pool, thus not making it eligible for Core Pool status.\n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xc592c33e51A764B94DB0702D8BAf4035eD577aED`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

The purpose of this gauge is give pufETH holders a place to keep their liquidity and not be susceptible to rate arbitrage over time, while earning yield on wstETH and via Balancer's core pool infrastructure\n>\n>\n>\n> This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329).\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> *pufETH*\n>\n>\n>\n> * [Website ](https://www.puffer.fi/)\n> * [Documentation](https://docs.puffer.fi/)\n> * [Github Page](https://github.com/PufferFinance)\n> * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/puffer_finance)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Puffer is a native liquid restaking protocol (nLRP) designed to optimize the potential of restaking, built on Eigenlayer. It offers a comprehensive framework for stakeholders, including Stakers and Node Operators (NoOps), to engage in decentralized validation while enhancing rewards and safeguarding Ethereum's ethos.\n\nThe protocol's design encompasses various components:\n\n1. Protocol Features:\n  * Permissionless operation allows anyone to become a validator on Puffer, promoting accessibility.\n  * Native Restaking introduces the first liquid restaking protocol on Eigenlayer.\n  * Ethos Alignment ensures the protocol's self-capping mechanism to protect Ethereum's integrity.\n  * Explosive Growth potential for the protocol's native asset, pufETH, irrespective of validator queue lengths.\n2. NoOps Advantages:\n  * Capital Efficiency requires less than 2 ETH to operate a validator, encouraging wider participation.\n  * Slash Protection through anti-slashing hardware support mitigates risks.\n  * MEV Autonomy empowers NoOps to tailor their MEV strategy, enhancing Ethereum's resilience.\n3. Rewards Mechanism:\n  * Liquid Staking allows stakeholders to stake any amount of ETH, promoting flexibility.\n  * Restaking Rewards integration with Eigenlayer amplifies rewards for participants.\n  * Validator Tickets incentivize participation and create new markets within the ecosystem.\n  * Liquid Rewards ensure immediate liquidity for NoOps' execution rewards.\n\n>The Puffer Flywheel relies on collaborative efforts between Stakers and NoOps to drive growth while maintaining Ethereum's credibility. Governance oversees the creation and management of restaking modules, ensuring alignment with protocol objectives.\n\nThe process involves:\n\n* Staking ETH to mint pufETH tokens, providing a redeemable receipt for restaked ETH.\n* Registering a NoOp Validator by depositing validator tickets and collateral.\n* Provisioning ETH to NoOps' pending validators, ensuring fair servicing of protocol modules.\n* Earning PoS and Restaking Rewards based on validator performance and AVS execution.\n* Exiting Validators involves validating proof of exit and compensation for potential penalties.\n\nOverall, Puffer offers a robust ecosystem for stakeholders to participate in decentralized validation, optimize rewards, and contribute to Ethereum's decentralization and security.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> As pufETH grows in popularity and is able to generate yield for the holders, Balancer's tech utilizing rate provider oracles remains the optimal solution for liquidity providers retaining their yield. This will prove competitive over the long haul giving independent holders the option to choose between various Dexes for where to support their yield bearing assets. Balancer will also be providing incentives via their core pool mechanics. \n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:**\n> Puffer is decentralized in nature but is under construction in governance terms. See this portion of their [documentation](https://docs.puffer.fi/protocol/governance). \n>\n> 2. **Oracles:**\n>\n>\n>\n> * wstETH: [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72d07d7dca67b8a406ad1ec34ce969c90bfee768) is a legacy rate provider. \n> * pufETH: [0x71f80e2CfAFA5EC2F0bF12f71FA7Ea57c3D0c7Af](https://etherscan.io/address/0x71f80e2CfAFA5EC2F0bF12f71FA7Ea57c3D0c7Af#readProxyContract) was reviewed [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/PufEthRateProvider.md). \n>\n>\n> 3. **Audits:**\n>\n>\n> * pufETH has undergone several audits which are all outlined in their [github repo](https://github.com/PufferFinance/pufETH/tree/main/audits).\n>\n>\n>\n> 4. **Centralization vectors:**\n> Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting. Even those are only possible through multiple signers, no singularity. \n>\n>\n>\n> 5. **Market History:**\n>\n> * pufETH holds more than 1 billion USD worth of ETH and its trading history can be found [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pufeth).\n>\n>\n> 6. **Value:**\n>\n>\n> * pufETH holders are able to provide liquidity, leverage long term yield flywheels and a pairing with wstETH for higher capital efficiency, without increased underlying values suffering arbitrage. Balancer is able to solidify itself further with every partner in the LRT/LST market. This pool is a Core Pool and therefore will generate revenue for the DAO.\n\n**Pool Details**\n\n> Link to Pool: [0x63E0d47A6964aD1565345Da9bfA66659F4983F02](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x63e0d47a6964ad1565345da9bfa66659f4983f02000000000000000000000681)\n> Link to Gauges: [0x0B9Ea598757c7D03FB1937cc16bdD2C9D416ff80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0B9Ea598757c7D03FB1937cc16bdD2C9D416ff80)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x0B9Ea598757c7D03FB1937cc16bdD2C9D416ff80`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Holders of tETH earn real yield in excess of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage while still being able to use tETH for DeFi activities. \n\nThe Treehouse Protocol team proposes a Balancer Gauge for the tETH-wstETH pool on Ethereum with no emissions cap. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n\n* Website - [Treehouse | Decentralized Fixed Income Layer](https://treehouse.finance/)\n* Documentation - [Treehouse Finance Docs](https://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol) \n* CoinGecko - [tETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/treehouse-eth)\n*  Github Page - [Treehouse - gaia](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia)\n* Discord - [Treehouse](https://discord.com/invite/treehousefi)\n* Twitter - [x.com](https://x.com/TreehouseFi)\n* Gauge deposit contract - [tETH/wstETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862)\n* Protocol Audits - [Treehouse audits](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nTreehouse is a protocol that is building the decentralized fixed income layer for digital assets. Its main product offerings, tAssets and the Decentralized Offered Rate (DOR), were developed to address a critical gap in the fixed income digital assets market and set a standard for decentralized reference rates.\n\ntETH, the first tAsset deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, is a liquid staking token (LST) that converges the fragmented on-chain ETH interest rates market. Holders of tETH earn real yield exceeding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage across various lending and borrowing protocols, all while retaining the ability to use tETH for other DeFi activities.\n\nSince its launch, the tETH vault has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140 million worth of ETH within just a month and a half.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nTreehouse Protocol is working to establish the tETH-wstETH Gauge on Balancer to enhance the liquidity of tETH. Increased liquidity facilitates smoother entry and exit for traders and investors, which is essential for the overall usability and appeal of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) within the DeFi ecosystem. This liquidity boost not only supports market efficiency but also attracts more participants to the Balancer ecosystem, where the tETH-wstETH pool will generate yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** All ownable contracts are secured with a 5/7 multi-sig. Only the tETH contract is upgradable for future expansion plans.\n\n2. **Oracles:** [tETH-wstETH rate provider](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c53f86d9a6b01821f916802a7606e9255dfe4e2) is based on wstETH as a base asset, it is not compatible with any pools aside from a wstETH pairing for the intended use of a rate provider.\n\n4. **Audits:** Treehouse Protocol has been audited by entities such as Fuzzland, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits and the reports can be seen in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n5. **Centralization vectors:** The centralization vector primarily involves the execution of actions in the strategy contract which are done by a multi-sig appointed by the contract owner. However, all action contracts are well-defined and the executors can only perform the whitelisted actions included in the strategy contract.\n\n6. **Market History:** tETH has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140M worth of ETH since its launch on 10th September 2024. The tETH-wstETH Balancer pool has been in inception since 23 October 2024. More information about tETH and the Treehouse Protocol ecosystem can be found on the [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/treehouseprotocol/treehousefi).\n-[tETH-wstETH pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x1d13531bf6344c102280ce4c458781fbf14dad140000000000000000000006df)\n-[tETH-wstETH pool gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862)\n \n8. **Value:** The tETH-wstETH pool on Balancer is designed to be a key source of liquidity for the token on the Ethereum network. By pairing tETH with wstETH, the pool aims to provide a seamless trading experience while also offering enhanced rewards for liquidity providers. This structure is intended to optimize both liquidity and profitability within the ecosystem. In addition, users who stake their tETH-wstETH LP tokens will be able to earn points from our current ongoing points program.\n\n**Transaction Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
