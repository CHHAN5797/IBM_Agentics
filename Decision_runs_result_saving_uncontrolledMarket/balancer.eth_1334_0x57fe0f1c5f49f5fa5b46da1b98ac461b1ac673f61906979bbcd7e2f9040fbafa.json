        "body": "gm Balancer Community! Cameron here from Linea; we are excited to share an updated proposal on a potential Balancer deployment.\n\n## Intro\n\nPrior to Linea mainnet, [we proposed deploying](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-333-deploy-balancer-on-linea/4782) Balancer on the network. It was not the right time for a successful collaboration. However, since then, the Linea core team has been working on shipping new tech, onboard top partners, and growing the ecosystem.\n\nLinea offers EVM equivalence, scalability, and reduced transaction costs while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees through Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The network has seen consistent growth, with current TVL at ~$605.5 M on the network per[ L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/linea), and ~$334M in tracked protocols, according to [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Linea).\n\nNow is the perfect time to revisit this proposal on growing Balancers' presence on the network.\n___\n\n## Proposal Details\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis proposal asks the Balancer community to support deployment on the Linea Network and exploration in enabling incentives.\n\n### Motivation\n\nOur motivation is threefold:\n\n1. *Participation in the Surge, liquidity campaign*\n2. *To support the growth of Key partners*\n3. *Position Balancer as core network infrastructure and innovate on future product developments*\n\n#### 1 | Participation in the Surge\n\nThe Surge program is a points based activation focused on growing liquidity and will go live in *1-2* *weeks*. It aims to bootstrap protocols like Balancer, enhancing the ecosystem by distributing points for active liquidity. This will ensure the expansion of available assets through DeFi use cases built on Linea.\n\nPoints, represented as non-transferable *ERC20* tokens, will help measure user contributions towards the network's decentralization. By encouraging additional liquidity, we anticipate creating a flywheel effect that bolsters both new use cases and overall network volume.\n\nLinea is committed to including the Balncer protocol in the Surge program within the first 1-2 weeks of going live. *(deployment dependant)*\n\nYou can read more about the Surge below:\n- [Overview](https://docs.linea.build/use-mainnet/linea-surge/linea-surge-overview)\n- [Point Incentive Design](https://docs.linea.build/use-mainnet/linea-surge/linea-surge-model)\n\n#### 2 | Supporting Key Partners\n\nLinea is proud to partner with key protocols. The network's primary focus is expanding our liquid restaking token ecosystem. An example of this effort is our collaboration with RENZO, which has led to [ezETH](https://lineascan.build/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5) growth of over $100M USD. Although there are existing AMM solutions on the network, there's a notable demand for Balancer pools from prominent LRT firms, bridges, and stablecoin issuers.\n\nThis demand highlights a unique opportunity to establish significant liquidity on Balancer from the outset. Moreso, leveraging point incentives through the Surge program can catalyze growth across diverse use cases, amplifying the impact of this deployment.\n\n#### 3 | Product Integrations\n\nLinea's strategic positioning to the Consensys product suite, including the decentralized infrastructure network *(DIN)* and MetaMask, opens up various collaboration opportunities in the short term *(< 6 months)* and long term *(> 6 months)* ✨🦊🟧\n\n**Short term,**  Given Balancer's critical role in MetaMask Swaps on other networks, we anticipate it will also emerge as a primary route for swaps on Linea. Further, we would like to keep Protocol Contributors up to date with our collaboration with the MetaMask Portfolio - as we aim to create a hub of Web3 activities for users.\n\n**Long term,** the Linea growth team is committed to working closely with key stakeholders on integrating with upcoming Consensys products. While specifics are non-public, our goal is to bring new user experiences to the ecosystem, by leveraging our product suite.\n___\n\n## Other Information\n\n### About Linea\n* [Linea ](http://linea.build/)\n* [Linea Block Explorer](https://lineascan.build/)\n* [Linea Docs](https://docs.linea.build/)\n\n### Key Infrastructure\n\n* [Safe](https://safe.linea.build/welcome)\n* [RPC Endpoints](https://docs.linea.build/build-on-linea/tooling/node-providers)\n* [Messaging services & Bridge providers](https://linea.build/apps?types=bridge)\n\n### Timeline/Next Steps\n\nWe encourage discussion and will facilitate conversation with the community. If this proposal passes, we will work closely with contributors on a timeline that aligns with Balancer contributors on a deployment.",

        "body": "**Introduction**\n\nGood day Balancer governors 🙂\n\nI would like to propose a Balancer deployment onto Mode Network. Mode is a new L2 in the Superchain that has been live for 8 weeks and has over 240m dollars of TVL on chain and growing rapidly. 165m is deployed into dApps which is a very productive ratio for an L2. Balancer live within Mode would allow for more efficient trading execution and liquidity provision for users within the ecosystem. We have a focus on yield bearing assets like ezETH and weETH and Balancer would be a great home for their liquidity as more and more users bridge over their assets. If the DAO chooses to deploy, Balancer will be a key pillar in our dApp ecosystem and we would love to have your unique protocol as part of the family on Mode.\n\n**About Mode**\n\n[DeFillama](https://defillama.com/chain/Mode)\n[L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/mode)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/modenetwork)\n[Mode Docs](https://docs.mode.network/)\n\nMode is a DeFi focused L2 that is building out an ecosystem of quality dApps to create new onchain economies for users to engage with. We aim to be the yield hub of the Superchain. Mode is an optimistic roll up with the ability to have a modular approach to our technology stack. We are very quick to move onto new yield opportunities and will make sure Balancer is part of these campaigns as we grow together. Balancer provides a very efficient design for liquidity on some of our most important assets like liquid re-staking tokens. We are happy to support the bootstrapping period with liquidity and 2x Mode points to incentivize community engagement in providing liquidity.\n\n**Goals**\n\n* We propose Balancer deploy as soon as possible to be positioned as a key pillar within our ecosystem. \n\n* We will support your deployment with liquidity and incentives to support Balancer's deployment and growth as Mode grows. \n\n* We would also like to include Balancer as a core piece of technology in our accelerator to encourage developers to build innovative products on top of Balancers liquidity. \n\n* If deployed we will highlight Balancer on our ecosystem page so users can easily find the application.\n\n* There are several dApps within our ecosystem that would like to integrate Balancer if you choose to deploy within our ecosystem and we would be happy to facilitate these integrations with haste.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBalancer is a key pillar in DeFi and has the opportunity to tap in to our rapidly growing ecosystem to continue its growth across L2s. We would love to support you and get this deployment live.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/519\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/537\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDiscord: overnight-fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time. Our token has a cross-chain functionality with the help of Axelar.\n>\n>\n> Launch Price: $20\n> Presale Price: $20\n> OVN Tokenomics: [Overnight Tokenomics ($OVN)](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/overnight-tokenomics)\n> Presale Information: [Overnight Presale Information](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/ovn-presale)\n> 25% of OVN from Private Presale unlocked on Oct 2. and the remaining 75 will be linearly vested for 4 weeks.\n>\n>  Additional Information:\n> - We cancelled public presale and just used the money raised from private presale to bootstrap liquidity on DEXes. \n> - We have launched at 20m FDV.\n> - We are already live on Aerodrome and Velodrome Finance. We also incentivized huge amount of bribes on Aerodrome (7400$) and Velodrome ($5,700) (For Sept. 28 - Oct. 5)\n> - We have also provided 22.5k OP for our Beefy Boost Program that will be distributed in over 2 weeks.\n> \n> - The rate providers was also reviewed by the integrations team and deemed safe.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n> \n> We aim to create a competitive environment that rewards participation and ensures the most efficient allocation of resources. We believe that veBAL voters are sophisticated and discerning and they will prioritize the community’s best interest. Complexity is often a byproduct of innovation. Our past experiences teach us valuable lessons, enabling us to build more robust systems.\n> \n> While 80/20 pools have been associated with locking, the beauty of the DeFi space is its adaptability. Our objective is to leverage the pool structure for its inherent benefits, not merely conform to traditional use-cases. The goal is to amplify liquidity and ensure stability, rather than exploit emissions. We’re using the pool to its fullest potential to cater to the evolving needs of the market. As also noted, the proposed bribe per week represents a significant boost in Aura’s bribe market, should all bribes be channeled in here.\n> \n> The absence of a defined market cap or trading history doesn’t undermine the intrinsic value of the coin or its future adoption potential. The proposed gauge allocation, especially the 2% caps, is informed by a forward-looking strategy, ensuring that it aligns with the expected bribes and accrued yield.\n> \n> The gauge allocation is in recognition of the potential this new coin brings. Traditional metrics, like trading history, might not fully capture the inherent value and projected adoption. We’re operating in a rapidly evolving landscape; hence, a forward-looking approach is crucial. Coingecko’s preview status doesn’t reflect the groundwork and strategic partnerships that underscore this project.\n> \n> The proposal aims to push the boundaries, capitalize on new opportunities, and ensure the best outcome for the community. We trust the veBAL voters to recognize the merit and long-term vision of this initiative.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?

This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/WETH 50/50 pool] on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n**Oracles:**\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\n**Audits:**\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pd)\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting,\n\nOvertime, our goal is to migrate Renzo to utilize decentralized infrastructure.\n\n**Market History:**\nFrom 0 to 100, Renzo launched on EigenLayer Mainnet 1-month ago and has witnessed explosive growth. TVL is nearing +$90M USD, with +33k ETH restaked, and over +4,500 unique depositors.\n\nRenzo’s remarkable growth and strong community backing underscore its prominence servicing users with liquid restaking on EigenLayer. The ezETH/WETH pool on Balancer will mark its inaugural support on a DEX.\n \n \n![veBAL gauge.png](ipfs://bafkreihp6ndnucaokydajbmb5dma6skebx4wffdbcmfotxyrjzrxpf5zaa)\n    \n\n**Value:**\n\nRenzo recently closed a successful seed round in December 2023, raising $3.2 million in equity with a 1:1 Token Warrant. The post-round valuation stands at an impressive $25 million, showcasing strong support for Renzo’s innovative liquid restaking protocol.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2’s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects. \n\nAbove all, Renzo is committed to building the most successful liquid restaking ecosystem on EigenLayer, delivering rewarding experiences for all restakers and holders of ezETH.\n\n- [Add Pool Gauge Info] https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8B309a75f0D64ED632d45A003c68A30e59A1D8b\n- Rate Provider Review https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/4/files\n- The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n- gauge(address):0xa8B309a75f0D64ED632d45A003c68A30e59A1D8b\n- gaugeType(string): Ethereum\n\nAdditionally, this pool is requesting core pool status as per BIP-457",

    "ai_final_reason": "- The timeline voting metrics show unanimous and stable support for the 'Yes' option, indicating strong community backing early and throughout the voting period.\n- Market response during the proposal event window was positive with significant price and TVL increases, supporting the economic benefit of the deployment.\n- Forum sentiment is mostly supportive or neutral, aligning well with the vote outcome, indicating the decision mirrors community views.\n- Similar adjacent proposals also succeeded with positive lessons, reinforcing confidence in deploying on emerging ecosystems like Fraxtal.\n- Negative and cautious comments highlight resource management concerns but do not outweigh the overall positive impact and strategic advantage.\nTherefore, the recommendation is to approve deployment to Fraxtal, reflecting both community sentiment and long-term protocol benefit.",
