        "body": "Non-Constitutional\n\nAbstract\nTLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",

        "body": "Category: Constitutional - Process\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n\nSection 3 of the Constitution 10 describes this council in more detail.\nInitial Setup Transparency Report 3 details the current members of the council.\nSection 4 on the Constitution outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\nExecutive summary\nThis vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\nA smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and under multiple security audits.\nThis vote is meant to temperature check with the DAO both the process that will be conducted for the elections, as well as the smart contract system that will enable them.\nA successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader Arbitrum governance architecture.\nImplementation Status\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is currently under audit and is available for full review in: GitHub - ArbitrumFoundation/governance at c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched in, the full audit report will be made available in the codebase soon. A Code4Rena audit competition has also been commissioned for the election system and can be viewed at Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production\n\nBackground\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution alongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum’s smart contract suite:\n\nConstitution of the Arbitrum DAO 2 (esp. sections 3 10 and 4) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\nDAO Governance Architecture 5 - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the reader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n\nOpen Zeppelin Governor - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\nGnosis Modules 1 - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\nHigh-level Election Overview\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to the specification laid out in the Constitution, is split into:\n\nElection stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\nUpdate stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\nElection Stages\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\nNominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\nCompliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\nMember election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\nUpdate Stages\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nSecurity Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\nL2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\nIndividual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\nSecurity Council Election Flow\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2bk2mmknletnshsvxbohkbszppbkb3wdntpnraj7x2gwgx2rgqq)\n    \nElection Stages in detail\n1. Nominee selection (7 days)\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration, candidate endorsement:\n\nElection creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\nCandidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\nEndorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\nFallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\nImplementation details\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n\nCustom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n\nA new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\nCandidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.\nDelegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n2. Compliance check by the Foundation(14 days)\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organisation being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\nImplementation details\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n\nCalling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n3. Member election (21 days)\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n\n0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n\nSplit voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\nImplementation details\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit from Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can trigger a new member election:\n\nCall the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n\nA custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\nThese additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\nThe custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\nUpdate stages in detail\n1. Security Council manager update\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n\nRemove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\nAdd a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\nAddress rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members as well as explicit approval from the member carrying out the rotation.\nImplementation details\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n2. Timelocks and withdrawal\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n\nL2 timelock (3 days),\nL2 → L1 withdrawal (~7 days),\nL1 timelock (3 days).\nYou can read more about these stages in the governance docs 1. The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\nImplementation details\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n3. Individual council updates\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis safes:\n\nArbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nArbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\nEthereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nNova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will replace them.\n\nImplementation details\nTo do this the existing Upgrade Executor contracts on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom Governance Action Contract 2 will be used to call the specific OwnerManager addOwnerWithThreshold and removeOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\nAdditional affordances\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\nThe DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favour and 5/6 of cast votes are in favour. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nConstitution Updates\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution’s text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\nUpdate timeline for the election\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n\nFrom T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nFrom T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n\nAt T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n\nNew timeline. A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\nLess than 6 eligible nominees. The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\nInstallation time. We need to remove the phrase ‘immediately join the Council’ to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user’s right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 → L1 message.\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the Constitution with the following text:\n\nNominee selection (T until T+7 days): Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n\nCompliance process (T+7 until T+21 days): All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nMember election (T+21 until T+42 days): Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n\nAt T+42 days: The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\nFinal update to the Constitution text.\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report  linked in the discussion",

        "body": "## Abstract\nHome to some of the best smart contract security researchers in the market and one of the strongest Developer Relations teams in the industry - professionals in Cyfrin come from backgrounds like Chainlink, Compound, Alchemy, Aragon, WorldCoin, Microsoft, Google, and other popular FinTech companies.\n\nThrough this proposal, Cyfrin would like to request $2M to improve and foster the security and longevity of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe will do this through launching the Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund dedicated to sponsoring audits for Arbitrum projects.\n\n## Motivation\nBlockchains solve global issues no other technology today has been able to solve: verifiable accountability, unbiased data exchange, trust without intermediaries, online ownership, permissionless transactions, global identities, to name a few…\n\nYet, until Web3 is safe, it is not scalable.\n\nIn July, total losses in the DeFi sector breached $77B according to a report from CryptoSlate. In 2022 alone, DeFi experienced hacks resulting in losses of over $3.1B. In 2023, a staggering $2.3B has already been stolen, indicating a trajectory higher than the previous year.\n\nThis is a security problem, a best practices problem, and a branding problem - rightfully keeping away institutions and users from a world-changing technology. Not solving this makes any effort of making web3 mainstream, vain.\n \n![7dbb9b4b71e82d06bc9ed50d172fbd4f740875d5.png](ipfs://bafkreig3zhjhipa7wcbmrhahe3smkhj6ytridrczvc4gizwkkkliyordde)\n    \nEvery time there is a hack on an Arbitrum project, both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the entire industry, suffer.\n\nGetting this right increases adoption at scale. Value exchange technologies without developers capable of using them appropriately have a hard time succeeding. Value exchange technologies with developers and protocols lacking security best practices create an unsafe environment for everyone participating.\n\n– The future of crypto hinders on projects prioritizing smart contract security.\n\nCyfrin commits to leveraging our team of industry experts to strengthen, support, and secure Arbitrum’s ecosystem and its developers.\n\n## Rationale\nLeveraging our auditing, engineering, and educational skill sets, the Cyfrin team will keep projects built on Arbitrum and its users safe. Through this proposal, Cyfrin aims to contribute to the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem through attracting incoming TVL for the Arbitrum ecosystem, gain user trust, and show traction to potential future investors.\n\nLaser-focused on Web3 security, Cyfrin is a market leader in smart contract audits. Cyfrin offers everything from private audits to competitive public and private audits, as well as a multi-phase auditing approach we’ve designed to ensure stronger security guarantees.\n\n![eef6f8ad9af263c4f7d23396654d6993e05d7dcd.png](ipfs://bafkreigtdj7fs7vq3fy2jdavaghommp3ha5vrtd4727gvrqhmwipf6uptm)\n\nAdditionally, you may find case studies for Oku Trade and SudoSwap to learn more about how Cyfrin works.\n\nSome testimonials from clients:\n\n“It was a pleasure to work with the Cyfrin team. Their approach to security and meticulous testing is exceptionally thorough. Additionally, their intimate knowledge of the Chainlink protocol made them particularly useful for our audit.” - Getty Hill, Oku Trade Founder\n\n“Working with Cyfrin feels like a true partnership — they are just plain good at what they do and above all are as motivated as anyone to move our industry’s security practices forward” - Beanstalk\n\n“Working with Cyfrin was a good experience, they kept in touch throughout the entire audit, and also followed up post-launch. Competitive with the best of the firms.\" - 0xmons from Sudorandom Labs\n\nThrough this proposal, we’re asking Arbitrum to fund a Security Enhancement Fund to audit projects built on its infrastructure. The fund will allocate funds to private, competitive, or multi-phase audits for projects built on Arbitrum.\n\nCyfrin will power the long-term success of Arbitrum protocols, so protocols feel safer going to market and users more comfortable interacting with the Arbitrum chain.\n\n## Key Terms\nAudit: An audit is a service where a security researcher reviews a codebase in depth with the intent of finding potential vectors for exploitation. Once completed, a report is presented to the protocol to fix any potential vulnerabilities found.\n\nPrivate audit: A team, consisting of usually 2-3 security researchers, spends weeks looking at a protocol’s codebase with the aim of finding the most critical exploit vectors in a codebase, as well as perform architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, etc.\n\nPublic Competitive Audit: An audit where hundreds, if not thousands, of security researchers review a codebase and compete for funds in a set reward pool based on the complexity of vulnerabilities found, its impact, and its uniqueness.\n\nPrivate Competitive Audit: An invite-only audit where a protocol invites top-performing auditors to review their code and compete in community driven audit competition.\n\nMulti-Phase Audit: a new, innovative model known as the Diverge-Converge Multi-Phase Model. Crafted to maximize the quality of audits, a critical aspect in the Web3 space, by strategically incentivizing auditors and ensuring that the protocol codebase goes through at least three comprehensive auditing phases, enhancing the protocol’s ultimate security.\n\n## Specifications\nThe entirety of the funds will be allocated towards funding security reviews for protocols, including the costs to run the audits, hire auditors, promote contests, bring judges, do customer support, and competition moderation.\n\nThe Fund will match up to 60% for the audit requested. The remaining amount will have to be paid by the project itself requesting for funding. This is mostly to weed out projects just looking for a free audit, ensuring we’re truly enabling long-lasting impact for the ecosystem.\n\nThe one exception to this rule is projects who are already deployed on Arbitrum and who can prove a high number of active users, total value locked, or who provide user retention and stickiness across the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole. Establishing the details of what “high” means in this case will be a task of the Allocation Committee once formed.\n\nThese audits may come in the form of competitive audits, through our CodeHawks platform, private audits through our security research team, or through our multi-phased approach combining the above.\n\n## Audit Types\nCompetitive Audits\nCodeHawks, one of the leading competitive auditing platforms in the market and home to some of the top security experts in the industry, enhances the security of protocols through community-driven smart contract security reviews.\n\nOn CodeHawks, hundreds of auditors study, test, stress, and review the same protocol’s codebase for a defined amount of time - finding bugs and potential exploit vectors. Auditors then submit the findings to the platform for judge review and monetizing based on the vulnerabilities uncovered.\n\nPrivate Audits\nPrivate audits, an option tailored to yet-to-be deployed, and already-live protocols. A hand-in-hand relationship between protocol’s engineering team and our security research squad is formalized to uncover vulnerabilities and support developers with state-of-the-art best practices guidance.\n\nThrough constant communication, the protocol’s engineering team is able to revise vulnerabilities as soon as they’re found - ensuring the team can start working on fixes immediately. Auditors also provide architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, specific knowledge like formal verification, code smells, testing feedback, etc.\n\nMulti-phase Audits\nDesigned for large and more complex protocols, the Multi-Phase audit approach has the stronger security guarantee of them all since it encourages the protocol to go through several audit phases before completing the final report.\n\nTo learn more about the Multi-Phase Audits, review here. \n\n![94de3d610083fec1fdc4d0cd35c1720832865f5b.png](ipfs://bafkreiauxpn2v4ymg4djs22mshbdtzucp73zr62byswrmto5dzr7fzqloq)\n\n## Allocation Committee\nThe Allocation Committee is the group responsible for determining which projects should receive audit funding. Cyfrin will lead the charge of setting this Committee up within 2 weeks of proposal approval.\n\nThe multisig account for the Allocation Committee will contain 5 people (3 from Arbitrum’s side, 2 from Cyfrin). Each team (Cyfrin and Arbitrum) will select who from their organizations will represent them in the Allocation Committee within 10 days of proposal approval.\n\nOnce composed, the committee will determine any additional eligibility criteria and share them with the community before opening up the application funnel. The application funnel should open within a maximum of one month post proposal approval.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee is responsible for defining the appropriate application process and reviewing applications on a recurrent basis. The process for reviewing these applications, as well as how often the Committee meets will be determined by the members based on the amount of applications received and their complexity.\n\nWe saw the community gather together under the STIP proposal and would like the same community participatory process to guide the direction of how the fund allocates the distribution. It’s a discovery process that we will run, partnering with Arbitrum to validate findings and iterate repeatedly.\n\n## Eligibility criteria for protocols applying to the Security Enhancement Fund\nThe Security Enhancement Fund aims at improving the security of all projects that have already deployed or will be deploying into the Arbitrum chain.\n\nAny protocol that adds value to the Arbitrum ecosystem across DeFi, Gaming, DAOs, or social projects, real world assets tokenization, track and trace solutions, or any other track, bringing a healthy and sustainable contribution to the ecosystem, is welcomed to apply.\n\nProjects should have already deployed to Arbitrum mainnet to apply, although exceptions can be made for:\n\nProtocols who commit to deploying on Arbitrum within 6 months of the audit - if this is the case, the code being audited must be deployed exclusively on Arbitrum for 6 months before launching elsewhere. The Allocation Committee will determine when taking such a risk is worth the assessment.\n\nProtocols who already have deployed and gained traction on other chains, looking to deploy to Arbitrum as well - if this is the case, information regarding the protocol’s TVL, active user base, and Arbitrum strategy should be shared in the application for review by the Allocation Committee.\n\n## Ineligible Projects\nIn an effort to keep the Arbitrum ecosystem secure and sustainable, we comply and leverage Arbitrum’s guidelines 2 to determine which projects are ineligible to apply for the Security Enhancement Fund.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee may establish additional guidelines for ineligible projects.\n\n## Security Enhancement Fund Distribution\nThe 100% of the funds from the Security Enhancement Fund will be used to audit Arbitrum projects.\n\nThe fund allocation per project will cover 60% of the protocol audit, expecting the protocol to cover the rest. The reasoning behind this is to ensure only protocols serious about their long-term growth get audited. However, an exception of sponsoring 80% of the audit could be made for unique situations as established by the Allocation Committee, like for a protocol amounting for large ecosystem growth or a large protocol deploying to Arbitrum.\n\nThis makes it extremely convenient for protocols built on Arbitrum to enhance the security of their codebase and protect users’ assets.\n\nAudit prices are aligned with industry standards and calculated based on the complexity of the codebase under review.\n\nFor competitive audits, the prize pool is calculated as approximately $30 multiplied by the number of lines of code in the code base.\n\nFor private audits, the cost is calculated as $60,000 multiplied by the number of weeks required by the auditors to read, understand, and review the code base in scope. The time required for each audit is evaluated before the security review by the lead auditor assigned to the project and will be made publicly available to the community.\n\nProtocols are permitted to undergo one or multiple smart contract security reviews per protocol update. The number of reviews is determined based on the codebase size, as indicated below:\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with less than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 1 per type.\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with more than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 2 per type.\n\nnSloc is an objective measure and industry that stands for Normalized Source Code. Calculated reducing all multiline functions declarations to a single line, removing all comments and empty lines and counting the remaining number of lines of code.\n\nWhatever allocation we don’t spend, at the end of the year we will return to the DAO for further use.\n\n## Steps to implement\nWithin the next year, the Cyfrin team commits to:\n\n1. Technical implementation of creating the Allocation Committee’s multisig and define its members\n2. Allocation Committee details eligibility requirements and allocation criteria\n3. Define and implement process for protocols to apply for audits alongside the Allocation Committee\n4. Review applications and start distributing funds strategically for protocols who meet the criteria\n5. Pair auditors with protocols\n6. Kick-off auditing process\n7. Amplify the Security Enhancement Fund as a great reason for projects to choose Arbitrum as their L2 of choice, as well as promotion of the protocols Cyfrin audits\n8. Final report to protocols\n\n– Keep in mind, this process may vary depending on whether the protocol is undergoing a private, competitive or multi-phase audit.\n\n## Team\nPatrick Collins: Cyfrin’s CEO and former Lead of Chainlink DevRel, Patrick revolutionized the industry onboarding hundreds of thousands of developers into web3 with its courses and speeches, with more than 3 million views on his courses and ~160.000 subscribers across platforms.\n\nAlex Roan: Cyfrin’s CTO, Alex is a veteran Web3 developer who has contributed to core DeFi infrastructure such as Chainlink and Compound - securing billions of dollars in value.\n\nHans Friese: Cyfrin Lead Auditor and Co-founder, Hans is one of the world’s top auditors, consistently ranking at the top within competitive auditor leaderboards 2. He is also the founder and Lead Engineer of Solodit, the most used vulnerability aggregator tool for auditors.\n\nDon Dodge: tech veteran with a past in Google, Microsoft, Groove, Napster, AltaVista, and more. Startup investor, advisor, and board member.\n\nMark Scrine: previously the Strategic Lead for Proof of Reserve at Chainlink Labs and led a number of their biggest integrations. These included protocols such as TUSD, Matrix Port, Avalanche Bridge, BackedFi, and Swell Network.\n\nDeveloper Relations & Marketing: Our industry leading DevRel team will work together with the Arbitrum’s community to promote, educate, and onboard auditors into the Cyfrin ecosystem, advocating for audit quality for protocols. Additionally, through Cyfrin’s Education platform, our DevRel team is brewing the next generation of software engineers into the space with Arbitrum as their L2 of choice. Composed of 6 people total, here’s an example of some of the leaders in our team:\n\nVitto Rivabella, formerly leading Developers Experience at Alchemy, the popular Web3 infrastructure provider, and Alchemy University, educating tens of thousands of Web3 developers. Web3 educator, investor, developer, public speaker and a former VFX supervisor.\n\nJuliette Chevalier, former Lead of Developer Relations at Aragon and Co-founder of Surge Women, an organization bridging the educational gap between women and crypto products. She is also a key contributor to various DAOs, angel investor, software engineer, and public speaker.\n\nCommunity Manager: Our Community Manager will foster peer-to-peer relationships and manage technical support for the students going through the Arbitrum courses - a vital resource for community members seeking assistance and supporting CodeHawks auditors to do their best work.\n\nDesign: Our design team will create visually engaging and user-friendly materials, enhancing the overall learning experience for the Abitrum developer community and CodeHawks auditors.\n\nCodeHawks Team: The CodeHawks team together with Cyfrin will run, promote, judge, support and moderate the competitions and the community, onboarding and assisting the protocols looking to onboard on Arbitrum. Once the team has made sure the protocol respects the eligibility criteria, they will manage the entire cycle from start to finish. This includes sales (answering to active inbounds, and protocols suggested by the community), contest details, marketing, judging, and final report submission.\n\nAudit Team: Our team of security researchers are experts across a variety of fields like DeFi, oracles, Web3 social, and more. They come from the industry’s top auditor leaderboard and are dedicated entirely to the private audits.\n\n## Cost\nThe budget for this proposition totals $2 million.\n\nThe entirety of the funds is dedicated towards the sponsoring of audits for protocols deployed or deploying on Arbitrum.\n\nThe entirety of the funds will be expected upon proposal approval to maintain a rapid response to audit requests and safeguard protocol integrity.\n\nUpon the onchain approval of the proposal, these funds will be transferred to the Allocation Committee’s multi-sig, as set up by Cyfrin containing the 2 Cyfrin Committee representatives. The multi-sig’s first transaction will then add the 3 Arbitrum representatives before transferring any funds to protocols.\n\nAdditionally, Cyfrin suggests the Allocation Committee reimburses the DAO quarterly in the event that the minimum expected capital for that quarter ($500,000) isn’t spent within that time period. This will also enable a tangible oversight mechanism for the DAO to ensure Cyfrin is doing the expected work.\n\n## Why $2M?\n\nAt an average cost of $60,000, sponsored at 60%, $2M would cover anywhere from 20-25 audits in the span of a year.\n\nAlthough the cost of an audit varies widely based on codebase size, complexity, and audit type, audit prices typically range between $30,000-$100,000, with an average audit being ~$60,000.\n\nAssuming the Fund covers 60% of the audit, $2M are estimated to cover anywhere from 20-25 audits within the span of a year. Additionally, 70% of the fund will be used to cover existing protocols on Abitrum, with the remaining 30% used to cover new protocols launching on the chain.\n\n– Important to note that in order to have the best possible security for a protocol, projects often go through 2 or more audits - including private and competitive audits. Particularly for complex projects already holding a high TVL, a multi-phase audit is highly advised to decrease the chances of an exploit to an absolute minimum.\n\nConsidering Arbitrum is believed to have 1.2M total commits and over 1,100 Arbitrum repositories, with over 450 active developers, this fund would cover ~10% of Arbitrum’s development.\n\n https://www.developerreport.com/ecosystems/arbitrum\n\n## Framework on payments, reporting, and oversight\n\nCyfrin pledges to publish financial reports to the DAO to uphold transparency and accountability every quarter, outlining expenditure details, audits funded, decisions made, and progress updates. These reports will be posted in the Arbitrum DAO’s forum for the DAO to periodically review.\n\nSnapshot has a maximum character limit.

        "body": "Note: This proposal has been posted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created program to distribute up to 75,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through the January 31, 2024. It asks all participating grantees to self report data, and dashboards, summarizing grant performance.\n\n**Motivation**\nThis provisional framework aims to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed (1 19, 2 7, 3 4, 4 5).\nThe goals of the program are to:\n•\tSupport Network Growth: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n•\tExperiment with Incentive Grants: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n•\tFind new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n•\tCreate Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n**Rationale**\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n**Specifications**\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 75,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n \n![8b05a5d34faf8659a144f1d35081a89ae83e237e.png](ipfs://bafkreiaizvrpzwo5bn6lxl5ikdywhfakyphtdukgkywpuzpvlrokaaj2oe)\n     \nFollowing a successful Snapshot Temperature Check, the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check will be designed to both achieve consensus and approve funding across four options, where each vote will distinguish support of up to X ARB through the end of January 31, 2024:\n•\tFor up to **25M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **50M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **75M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tAgainst.\n\n**Financial Proposal**\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n•\tA ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and application template 37 as articulated in this document.\n•\tApproval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n•\tA 25,000,000, 50,000,000 or 75,000,000 ARB distribution to the program Multisig.\n•\tA 32,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\no\t20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n\tDraft and review of multiple iterations of incentive proposals.\n\tModeration of community calls and working group telegram.\n\tCoordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\no\t12,000 ARB Multisig Signers (A new version of the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig 17 - 2K per signer).\n\n**Multisig Setup**\nA new multisig will be created with the signers from the original pl-ARB multisig, under the name of the Arbitrum DAO. The new multisig will include two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1.\tClawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2.\tStreaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n**What are the Eligibility Requirements?**\n\nGrant Requirements:\n•\tGrantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n•\tGrantees must not farm their own incentive programs.\n•\tGrantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n•\tGrantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard or alternatively in a report.\n•\tGrantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n•\tGrantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n•\tGrantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n•\tGrants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n•\tGrantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n•\tGrantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n•\tGrantees must apply using the approved program application template 15.\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n•\tAny use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n•\tFailure to comply with data reporting standards.\no\tGrantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n•\t•\tDashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n•\t•\tMore granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\no\tIf dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n**Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines**\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there’s no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n•\t**Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $1.5M TVL.\n\t.>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $4M TVL.\n\t.>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n\t.> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n\tMeets one of the following criteria\n\t.> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n\t.> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\n*Grants greater than $1M ARB will be asked to include milestone-based funding tranches in their application.\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n**Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?**\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\nCycle 1\n1.\tApplication Period (1 Week):\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application Template 20.\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2.\tReview Period (1 Week):\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3.\tVoting Period (1 Week):\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the PL-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\nCycle 2\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n**Timeline**\n[See image above]\nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 09, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\n\nCycle 1\nSep. 16, 2023 - On-Chain Vote and Application Period\nSep. 23, 2023 - Review Period Begins\nSep. 30, 2023 - Voting Round Begins\nOct. 07, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\nCycle 2\nOct 07, 2023 - Application Period 2 Begins\nOct 14, 2023 - Review Period 2 Begins\nOct 28, 2023 - Voting Round 2 Begins\nNov. 04, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\n**Overall Cost**\nUp to 75,032,000 ARB.\n\n**Outstanding Questions and Concerns**\n\nWhat happens if the budget is exceeded?\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 75M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\nWhat will happen to excess funds?\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\nWhat is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of allowing incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\nWhat are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?\n•\tCommunity Support: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n•\tNetwork Activity: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n•\tCommunity Awareness: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n•\tIncentives Data: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n**Forum Link **\n\nThis snapshot is replication of the forum post.

This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:\n\n* Number of active developers\n* Dev Github quality\n* Delegate engagement satisfaction\n* Voter participation\n* Capture-resistance\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**\n\n* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops\n* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way\n* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**\n\n* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows\n* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**\n\n* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**\n\n* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success\n* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “we can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs\n\nWithin web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.\n\n### Centralised Grants Program: Problems\n \n![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)\n    \n* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program\n* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.\n* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding\n* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to “open the door” for those who they know or have worked with before.h.\n\n### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems\n\n![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)\n    \n* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.\n* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas…\n* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.\n* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.\n* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.\n* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.\n\n### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds.\n\nAt its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\n![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)\n    \n> 💡The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n* Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n* Domain expertise and knowledge\n* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission\n* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling\n* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism\n* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n\nThis is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\n\nThis is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n![88d617338384427ed53607b929264bc8b623ef43_2_624x281.png](ipfs://bafkreiaylf4ugerhg5c755rx2ffjydpjcri6sx7mohjrafoiuylihkijfy)\n    \n### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.\n\nWeb3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n### Multisig Management\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.\n\n> 💡 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n### Team\n\nPlurality Labs Team\n\n**Disruption Joe**\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million.

In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\n\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.\n\nIf successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1.
