        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1225\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to enable uncapped Balancer gauge for inETH/wstETH pool on Optimism.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n• Website: https://www.inceptionlrt.com/\n\n• Documentation: https://docs.inceptionlrt.com/\n\n• Github Page: https://github.com/inceptionlrt/smart-contracts/tree/master\n\n• Twitter: https://x.com/InceptionLRT\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nInceptionLRT is an omnichain liquid restaking protocol offering both Native and Isolated restaking to users. Powered by the Flash Unstake mechanism and supported by node operators with DVT Technology, InceptionLRT aims to become the most complete liquid restaking protocol in DeFi. The isolated architecture combined with the flash unstake feature solves the only drawback of isolated LRTs - liquidity fragmentation! inETH is the native LRT that users get by depositing ETH.\n\nstETH is a rebase token by Lido that also represents staked ether but instead of the exchange rate accumulation method, the staking rewards are given as extra stETH. Effectively, stETH always stays pegged 1:1 with ETH and stETH token balances are updated when the oracle reports the change in the total (initial deposit + staking rewards) every day. wstETH is the wrapped version of regular stETH which allows for stETH accumulation in the contract and turns the rebase model of stETH into the C-token model of other LSTs.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nSubstantially increase the liquidity of inETH on Optimism.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** ING holders participate in decision-making, influencing the protocol’s direction and policies, including the Node Operators, AVSs and restaking strategies.\n\nIncentive Allocation:\n\n2. **Oracles:**\n\n[inETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x210ABdFD989f3eE5C08614a8f4e096Cf8408f5DF)\n\n[wstETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xef42D000a3e85C4e71C57e2C6A1E600e86f5a91B)\n\n3. **Audits:**\n\nInceptionLRT undergoes security audits and checks to ensure the safety of user funds. Latest: https://docs.inceptionlrt.com/security/audit-reports\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:**\n\nThe InceptionLRT Litepaper introduced the vision for Inception as a decentralized system where independent node operators work to power the growth and development of Web3.\n\n5. **Market History:**\n\nMarket history and protocol information can be found here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/inception-restaked-eth\n\n6. **Value:**\n\nThe pool is intended to be a major source of liquidity for inETH on Optimism and allow for a healthy stimulation of volume.\n\n**Contracts:**\n\n[inETH contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5A7a183B6B44Dc4EC2E3d2eF43F98C5152b1d76d)\n\n[inETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x210ABdFD989f3eE5C08614a8f4e096Cf8408f5DF)\n\n[wstETH contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb)\n\n[wstETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15)\n\n[Pool link](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x0ccb0c34d4898dfa8de3ece9d814074e60adefd0000000000000000000000142)\n\n[Pool contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0ccb0c34d4898dfa8de3ece9d814074e60adefd0)\n\n[Child gauge on Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x476F2DedF358eB87c4C22DFaf5e511f68e0272e0)\n\n[Root gauge on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x24E9A49Ffd2B2189940E802e62f318382fAB395c)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`\nwill interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x24E9A49Ffd2B2189940E802e62f318382fAB395c`\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",
