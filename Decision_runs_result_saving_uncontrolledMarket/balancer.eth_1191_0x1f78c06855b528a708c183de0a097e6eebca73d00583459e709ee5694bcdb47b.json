Its main product offerings, tAssets and the Decentralized Offered Rate (DOR), were developed to address a critical gap in the fixed income digital assets market and set a standard for decentralized reference rates.\n\ntETH, the first tAsset deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, is a liquid staking token (LST) that converges the fragmented on-chain ETH interest rates market. Holders of tETH earn real yield exceeding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage across various lending and borrowing protocols, all while retaining the ability to use tETH for other DeFi activities.\n\nSince its launch, the tETH vault has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140 million worth of ETH within just a month and a half.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nTreehouse Protocol is working to establish the tETH-wstETH Gauge on Balancer to enhance the liquidity of tETH. Increased liquidity facilitates smoother entry and exit for traders and investors, which is essential for the overall usability and appeal of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) within the DeFi ecosystem. This liquidity boost not only supports market efficiency but also attracts more participants to the Balancer ecosystem, where the tETH-wstETH pool will generate yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** All ownable contracts are secured with a 5/7 multi-sig. Only the tETH contract is upgradable for future expansion plans.\n\n2. **Oracles:** [tETH-wstETH rate provider](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c53f86d9a6b01821f916802a7606e9255dfe4e2) is based on wstETH as a base asset, it is not compatible with any pools aside from a wstETH pairing for the intended use of a rate provider.\n\n4. **Audits:** Treehouse Protocol has been audited by entities such as Fuzzland, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits and the reports can be seen in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n5. **Centralization vectors:** The centralization vector primarily involves the execution of actions in the strategy contract which are done by a multi-sig appointed by the contract owner. However, all action contracts are well-defined and the executors can only perform the whitelisted actions included in the strategy contract.\n\n6. **Market History:** tETH has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140M worth of ETH since its launch on 10th September 2024. The tETH-wstETH Balancer pool has been in inception since 23 October 2024. More information about tETH and the Treehouse Protocol ecosystem can be found on the [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/treehouseprotocol/treehousefi).\n-[tETH-wstETH pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x1d13531bf6344c102280ce4c458781fbf14dad140000000000000000000006df)\n-[tETH-wstETH pool gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862)\n \n8. **Value:** The tETH-wstETH pool on Balancer is designed to be a key source of liquidity for the token on the Ethereum network. By pairing tETH with wstETH, the pool aims to provide a seamless trading experience while also offering enhanced rewards for liquidity providers. This structure is intended to optimize both liquidity and profitability within the ecosystem. In addition, users who stake their tETH-wstETH LP tokens will be able to earn points from our current ongoing points program.\n\n**Transaction Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n> 2. **Oracles:**\n>\n>\n>\n> * ‘rateProvider0’ for weETH: [0x5a7A419C59eAAdec8Dc00bc93ac95612e6e154Cf](https://basescan.org/address/0x5a7A419C59eAAdec8Dc00bc93ac95612e6e154Cf)\n> * ‘rateProvider1’ for wstETH: [0x3b3dd5f913443bb5E70389F29c83F7DCA460CAe1](https://basescan.org/address/0x3b3dd5f913443bb5E70389F29c83F7DCA460CAe1)\n>  * both rate providers are Chainlink feeds and [whitelisted](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/29855a56d89abcf3c91243e2f2ee4729c68e29cd/rate-providers/registry.json).\n>\n>\n>\n> 3. **Audits:** Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports).

Its mission is to bring DeFi into the Bitcoin ecosystem, driven by an ecosystem-centric approach and supported by seasoned DeFi experts and industry-leading partners.\n\nBy abstracting complexities, PumpBTC facilitates effortless collaboration between users and Babylon. Users can stake into Babylon with a single action through PumpBTC, immediately receiving liquidity tokens without waiting periods.\n\nInspired by the \"pump\" meme culture in the Bitcoin community, PumpBTC aims to help BTC holders maximize yields through Babylon's liquid staking - essentially rebuilding WBTC/BTCB with native yield.\n\nThe historical price of pumpBTC can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pumpbtc\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pumpbtc/\n\n### Motivation\n\nPumpBTC is launching further strategic pools.\n\n### Specifications\n\n#### Governance\n\n#### The governance token has not been released yet.\n\n#### Oracles\n\nRedStone:[ 0x85C4F855Bc0609D2584405819EdAEa3aDAbfE97D](https://app.redstone.finance/app/feeds/?search=pumpBTC&page=1&sortBy=popularity&sortDesc=false&perPage=32)\n\n##### Audits\n\n* [BlockSec Security Audit Report for PumpBTC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kUmOPM8J63JmzM20H1Cg38oAfPRBJwLy/view?pli=1)\n* [Quantstamp Security Audit Report for PumpBTC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWQlC4iZenwHrjNOsBdKyVkFbEaUnwD-/view)\n\n#### Centralization vectors\n\nNo centralization vectors.\n\n#### Value\n\nThe balancer pool is one of the few LRT pools on Ethereum and is aimed at providing liquidity to the growing community. Additionally, pumpBTC will always be pegged 1:1 with WBTC, and users can instantly withdraw at any time.\n\n##### Market History\n\nMarket history and protocol information can be found here on the PumpBTC Dune dashboard - https://dune.com/pumpbtcintern/pumpbtc-summary\n\n##### Value\n\nThe WBTC-pumpBTC pool on Balancer is intended to serve as one of the primary liquidity sources for the token on Ethereum. The pairing of WBTC with pumpBTC will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.\n\n##### Contracts\n\npumpBTC on Ethereum: `0xf469fbd2abcd6b9de8e169d128226c0fc90a012e`\n\nWBTC/pumpBTC Base pool on Balancer: https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x2238ab6c8c58473a5e81b86ec352322fb3f5edd80000000000000000000006de\n\n##### Specification\n\n* Mainnet Gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0xDFaD195F91e1591ae8Eb4c1c7183185CeF58864D\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`\nwill interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xDFaD195F91e1591ae8Eb4c1c7183185CeF58864D`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

The calibration was improved over the previously deployed, equivalent pool that was whitelisted [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-691-enable-gauge-for-gyd-wsteth-e-clp-arbitrum/5956).\n\n**Specification**\n \n>1. **Governance:** The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n>\n>\n>2. **Oracles:** \n> * ‘rateProvider0’: wstETH rate provider on Arbitrum: [0xf7c5c26B574063e7b098ed74fAd6779e65E3F836](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7c5c26B574063e7b098ed74fAd6779e65E3F836)\nand relevant [review ](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/wstethRateProvider.md).\n> *  ‘rateProvider1’: GYD rate provider on Arbitrum: [0x72F6Da3b4bd0Ab7028F52339Ee3B1f94fffe2dD0](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x72F6Da3b4bd0Ab7028F52339Ee3B1f94fffe2dD0).\n>\n>3. **Audits:** Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production since November 2022.\n>\n>4. **Centralization vectors:** No centralization vectors.

        "title": "[BIP-680] Enable weETH/wETH Gauge w/ 10% cap [Arbitrum]",
        "author": "0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17",
        "body": "PR with Payload:\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1247\n\n**Summary**\nThe [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-wETH pool on Arbitrum, with a 10% emissions cap. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n```\n• Website - https://www.ether.fi/\n• Documentation - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper\n• Github Page - https://github.com/etherfi-protocol\n• Discord - https://discord.com/invite/zqGzcuQWvD\n• Twitter - https://twitter.com/ether_fi\n```\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool.\n\nETH staked through the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, while also being natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols.\n\nThe eETH contract has been live since June 2023, with eETH launching to the open market on November 15th, 2023, and has approx. 2M ETH held within it. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token, eETH, is aligned to the price of ETH.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is looking to seed a weETH/wETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for weETH on Arbitrum. Incentivising a Balancer pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Arbitrum. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the L2 DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) executives and key stakeholders of the protocol. \n2. **Oracles:** - The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however as the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.\n\n* The exchange rate feed for weETH-ETH on Arbitrum has been deployed by Chainlink.\n\n3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) protocol are found on the GitBook page - [Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. \n5. **Market History:** - eETH was first deployed November 15, 2023. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) Dune dashboard - https://dune.com/ether_fi/dune-dashboards-portal \n6. **Value:** - The weETH/wETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum. The pairing of eETH with wETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.\n\nweETH on Arbitrum: 0x35751007a407ca6FEFfE80b3cB397736D2cf4dbe\n\nweETH/wETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf13758d6edd1937dcb3f4fe75889b579d400299a\n\nChild Gauge: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x30b1c88144313D561ae6763d953B68fba1AB78b5\nRoot Gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0xF22c4C0093a13c193A3162d5B50bC92a8ECB58ef\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xF22c4C0093a13c193A3162d5B50bC92a8ECB58ef`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
