Integrate BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and updated risk service provider recommendations.\n3. Submit the ARFC for a Snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 Base (upon Mainnet launch)\n\n## **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Rocket Pools is expanding its support for rETH across the L2 ecosystem, first Optimism, now Arbitrum and soon Polygon. There are currently only Chainlink Oracles for Arbitrum and Ethereum. Thus, this publication presents listing rETH on Arbitrum ahead of Optimism.\n\nA new rETH liquidity pool and gauge has been created on Balancer v2 Arbitrum for rETH/bb-a-wETH. This pool will deposit wETH into Aave v3 on Arbitrum. Incentives are expected to follow soon. This publication is early and provides risk service providers adequate time to review the asset listing parameters whilst liquidity continues to grow.\n\nLST collateral types drive material borrowing revenue to Aave as users deposit the LST and borrow the corresponding network token. This is most evident on Ethereum where the LST- and wETH-yield-maximising loop is the source of the vast majority of wETH borrowing demand.\n\nBy providing LST diversification, Aave presents itself as a neutral platform offering users the choice between various LSTs. An added benefit of offering a variety of LSTs is the respective communities may elect to compete for user acquisition via Aave through offering incentives. This is currently happening on Aave v3 Polygon and Aave’s TVL has meaningfully increased from a relatively small base.\n\nRocket Pool offers Aave v3 users on Arbitrum an alternative to wstETH.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?**\n\nLlama does not receive any payments from Rocket Pool.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token ?**\n\nRocket Pool strives to embody the core ethos of Ethereum and DeFi, specifically the non-custodial, trustless nature that allows self-sovereignty to truly thrive. This leads to reduced Counter Party risk relative to other LST providers.\n\nRocket Pool stakers deposit ETH into the deposit pool, enabling a node operator to create a new Ethereum Network validator. You can stake as little as 0.01 ETH.\n\nIn doing so, users are given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH is deposited, and when the user deposited it. The ratio includes rewards that Rocket Pool node operators earn from:\n\n* The Ethereum network itself\n* Priority fees from block proposals\n* MEV rewards from block proposals\n\nrETH is a staked, interest earning wrapper of ETH that can be exchanged at any time. rETH is not a rebasing token and therefore represents a straight forward integration prospect for Aave.\n\nSince the Beacon Chain rewards, priority fees, and MEV rewards will constantly accumulate, this means that rETH's value effectively always increases relative to ETH. The rETH/ETH exchange rate is updated approximately every 24 hours based on the Ethereum network rewards earned by Rocket Pool node operators.\n\n![|602x436](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sMlYJ-qPHfY2tYHe1Mhs1wJksUHoMuahfUR_vD-nFYn3vVC34buszhgTZv8oSjGQVTKUsGLm1jzBlkLCoR1bN_gGG6QWZyxiXkHFeFvxympIK7fw8zOjmGqI-Qsw-ErQBhruZk_eby90o8WwKgescPc)\n\nFor details on how to stake ETH with Rocket Pool, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/). For those readers keen to learn more about rETH taxation implications, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token).\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nBy listing rETH as collateral, users benefit from staking rewards whilst taking out a loan.\n\nSimilar to other LSTs, there are a range of yield maximising strategies and lower carry cost leveraged trading strategies that users could deploy. Given the typically low borrowing cost for LSTs, users are able to borrow the LST and participate in yield strategies beyond the Aave protocol.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nRocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH development.\n\nRocket Pool is designed to cater to two main user groups; those that wish to participate in [tokenised staking using rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-2-5-tokenised-staking-48601d52d924#92b0) using as little as 0.01 ETH and those that wish to stake ETH and run a node in the network to help generate a higher return on investment than staking outside of the protocol due to commissions earned.\n\nFor more information on these two groups that make up the protocol, we'd highly recommend [reading article one in our explainer series](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd) that goes into great detail on how users can participate, be it via tokenised staking or running a node in the protocol.\n\nThe core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party. This is a principle directly linked to Ethereum and ETH itself, and a mindset used at every stage of the process as Rocket Pool has evolved.\n\n![|602x216](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fqwfASEawOZPpIGTuda282owPW_7OJNQ2sK-XLi1Bq4Y09EpnHnfcehIr7n-3jHDqu02Iw676wV8RwPq0KcoUn9V1wtRRXGDF-wCRDdRO5_atRmJ2x2UjjkDRlv9zbOV2hcV1-hcevUGvulZOzLIGJI)\n\n**5. How is the rETH token currently used ?**\n\nThe distribution of rETH is spread thinning across many addresses. According to Arbiscan, the largest holding is only 3.13% of supply on Arbitrum.\n\nrETH is new to Arbitrum and because of this, there are only a few extrinsic use cases. Providing liquidity on DEXs is one of the main use cases to date on mainnet and we expect this to be mirrored on Arbitrum. The new rETH/bb-a-wETH pool will soon receive incentives and will bootstrap a second liquidity pool complementing the existing Uniswap v3 pool.\n\nWith supporting liquidity and an oracle derived from DEX and CEX liquidity across several networks, Aave is positioned to be the dominant rETH lending/borrowing liquidity pool on Arbitrum. For reference, there is currently [$20.03M](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) of rETH deposits on Aave v3 Ethereum.\n\nFor further insights into how rETH is integrated across the ecosystem, please refer to this Rocket Pool community-maintained Defi Opportunities publication.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. rETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\n* The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities\n\n**8.

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave v3 MVP deployment on Scroll mainnet\n\nAuthor: Lea - Partnerships Lead at @Scroll_zkEVM\n\nDate: 2023-05-30\n\n----\n\n### Simple Summary:\n\nProposal to deploy an Aave v3 MVP to Scroll mainnet with limited assets onboarding and conservative risk parameters in order to allow Aave to establish a strategic position in the Scroll ecosystem while limiting risk exposure.\n\n### Background:\n\nThis Temp Check proposes the deployment of a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) version of Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet. Scroll mainnet will go live beginning of August this year and intends to onboard Aave V3 as one of the first DeFi dApps in the eocsystem. Scroll is an EVM-equivalent zk-rollup with the primary goal to provide scalability to Ethereum in the most robust and secure way. We guarantee this by being open source from day 1, a strong in-house security team paired with rigorous audits, third party provers upon our mainnet genesis block and a gradual decentralization of our sequencer network.\n\n### Motivation:\nAave will be given a prominent role in the early Scroll ecosystem and will be able to establish a strategic presence early on. Aave will be in good company of 150+ projects going live shortly after mainnet launch and will be able to harness a vibrant new ecosystem that expands across the globe.\n\n### Specification:\nThe proposal will detail the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet with three collaterals (WETH, USDC, wstETH) and one borrowable asset (USDC). We consulted Gauntlet and Chaos Labs for preliminary risk parameters and if this proposal is to pass, we will get further input on risk parameters for the listed assets at the ARFC phase.\n\n| Risk Parameter |WETH|wstETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | YES | NO | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES |\n| Emode Category | eth-correlated | eth-correlated | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 80%  | 82.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 82.5% | 85% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 5% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 15% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 80% | 45% | 90% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 4.8% | 4.8% | 4% |\n| Slope2 | 80% | 80% | 60% |\n\nTo limit risk exposure to the DAO, we commit 500,000 USD in $AAVE staked to the Aave Safety Module to provide additional security guarantees.\n\n### Disclaimer\nWe consulted both @Gauntlet and @ChaosLabs for this MVP proposal. The information provided above about preliminary risk parameters is based on public sources and previous comparable parameter proposals. It cannot be guaranteed that it is or will stay accurate. Neither Gauntlet nor Chaos Labs have been compensated by Scroll.\n\nThis TempCheck has been prepared to gauge initial feedback from the community and promote further discussion. The presented risk parameters will be finalized in the ARFC phase pending a positive outcome of the Temperature Check Snapshot\n\n### Next Steps\n**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet.\n\n**ARFC:** If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP:** If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n### Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Cronos proposes to deploy Aave V3 to the Cronos chain and to incentivize liquidity in order to help fulfill the promise of a multi-chain future.\n\nCronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. An open-source Layer 1 chain launched under the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  umbrella, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp (Web3) user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos, the majority via a centralized exchange. Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project: as [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  customers, as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem, and/or as [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  project supporters. These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3. For them, Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of self-custody, Ethereum and DeFi.\n\nThe cross-chain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3, resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users. Therefore, Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3.\n\n**Technical specifications of the network**\n\n*Network specifications*\n\n[Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/)  is an open-source project launched by  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  that brings together many  [open-source initiatives](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/blob/main/go.mod#L22)  of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).\n\nCronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called  [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/charts)  , as well as on  [Defillama for TVL data](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos)  .\n\nAt the protocol level, Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validator’s voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocol’s staking token. There are currently 26 live validators, with room for more. The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds, low transaction fees (usually below 1 USD) paid in CRO token, and small environmental footprint.\n\nUsers and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSON-RPC  [endpoints](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  . They can deploy any EVM-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, and can use all the usual end-user and developer tooling: MetaMask, Etherscan block explorer ([Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/) ), Gnosis Safe, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.\n\nThe Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations, specifically the Chainlink oracle, The Graph indexer, and commercial and JSON-RPC endpoints for Dapps (in addition to the existing  [free ones](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  ). These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project. A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022. Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects.\n\nThere are several bridges between Cronos and other networks :\n\n* [Live] Fast withdrawals from and to the  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  app and exchange.\n* [Upcoming] Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology, currently in testing and planned for imminent launch.\n* [Live] IBC transfers from and to the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  chain, Cosmos Hub, and Terra, with more IBC-compatible chains on the roadmap.\n* [Live] EVM smart contract-based transfers from and to BSC, Polygon, and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges, with more to come.\n* Security review of additional bridges is under way.\n\nCronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  [contributors](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  ,  [validators](https://cronos.crypto.org/partners)  , and  [Dapp developers](https://cronos.crypto.org/ecosystem)  . This includes 2 large AMM/DEXes, VVS Finance (1.4 B$ TVL) and MM Finance (320 M$ TVL).\n\nThe  [roadmap](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254)  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations, further connectivity and interoperability, best-in-class tooling and infrastructure, further protocol governance decentralization, dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps, and longer term plans to increase scalability.\n\n*Aave V3 implementation*\n\nAs part of this proposal, Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol, given that Cronos is fully EVM-compatible. Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer (implementation under way).\n\nThe Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVM-based cross-chain bridges (such as Connext and others, subject to further testing and security review) for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens.\n\n*Metrics and references*\n\nChain data as of Feb 15, 2022:\n* 26 live validators.\n* 15+ M transactions to date (no transaction pumping!)\n* 150,000 to 200,000 transactions per day, with potential to increase by 5x to 20x in the short term.\n* 350,000 unique wallets.\n* More than 120 Dapps deployed in the last 3 months, including VVS (DEX, 1.4 B$ TVL), MM Finance (DEX, 320 M$ TVL), Tectonic (decentralized lending, 275 M$ TVL), and others.\n\nAudience data\n*  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cronos_chain)  : 130k followers.\n*  [Telegram](https://t.me/Cryptoorg_Chain_Announcements)  : 7k subscribers.\n*  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pahqHz26q4)  : 19,000 members.\n\nLinks\n*  [Cronos website](https://cronos.crypto.org/) \n*  [Particle B ecosystem development program](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-ecosystem-grants-7a4a2de3b721) \n*  [Blockchain explorer](https://cronoscan.com/) \n*  [Particle B accelerator](https://www.particleb.com/) \n*  [Cronos integration documentation](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html) \n*  [Github](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  repository\n*  [Overview of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/nodes/)  node architecture\n\n**Proposed list of initial collaterals**\n\nThe proposed list of initial collaterals is: CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, ATOM, LUNA, DOT.\n\nAs indicated above, Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment.\n\nCronos already supports the  [following cross-chain assets](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#integration-guide-for-cronos-mainnet-beta)  : CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, SHIB, DOGE, ATOM, LINK, ENJ, ELON, TUSD, LUNA, DOT, BIFI, with more to come. Additional native tokens include VVS, TONIC. These tokens have between 10 M$ and 700 M$ of liquidity on Cronos. Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M$.\n\nThe proposed tokens have more than, or close to, 2 M$ daily volume each. With respect to DEX statistics, see  [VVS analytics](https://vvs.finance/info)  for history and liquidity per token.\n\n**Incentives**\n\nParticle B, the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain, has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development. A portion of these funds will be allocated to end-user incentives, commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos.\n\nIn our experience, the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions, hence the exact programs and amounts (expected to be worth several M$) will need to be refined over time.\n\n**Audits and security**\n\nCronos mainnet was launched in November 2021 and has not experienced outages so far.\n\nAn audit of relevant components of the underlying Ethermint codebase (  [crypto](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/crypto)  ,  [JSON RPC](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/ethereum/rpc)  ,  [Ante handler](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/app)  ,  [EVM state transition](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go)  ) was commissioned by Foris Ltd and completed by Kudelski Security. It is published in the Cronos Github repository ([link](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/tree/main/docs/audit)).\n\nA bug bounty program is  [published](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/)  , with a bounty of up to 1.3 M$.\n\nThank you for your support !",
