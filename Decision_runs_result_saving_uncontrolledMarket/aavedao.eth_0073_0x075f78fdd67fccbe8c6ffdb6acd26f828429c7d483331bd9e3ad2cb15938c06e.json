        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] GHO Gas Token Framework\nAuthor: @aavelabs\nDate: 2025-02-27\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis framework outlines a general approach for utilizing GHO as the gas token of a network. The framework is designed to be adaptable for any network looking to use GHO in this capacity. Unlike bridging GHO as an ERC-20 token, this framework establishes a structured approach to integrating GHO as a gas token through a native bridge.\n\nThe framework uses the canonical network bridge for minting GHO as a gas token. It also explores extensions such as integrating messaging protocols like Chainlink CCIP to align with the existing [GHO cross-chain strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-cross-chain-launch/17616). Additionally, a wrapper contract on Ethereum allows the GHO implementation to be upgraded and extended for future innovations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nStablecoins offer a fast, efficient, and stable means of transferring value on blockchain networks. Decentralized stablecoins like GHO add transparency and censorship resistance. Using GHO as a gas token makes it a core part of the network’s transaction layer, allowing it to function as a standard economic unit. This creates predictable pricing for gas fees, particularly in low-fee networks where transaction costs are often subsidized.\n\nThe decision to use a canonical bridge as the primary liquidity pool is based on the unique requirements of deploying GHO as a gas token rather than as a bridged ERC-20, and ties security of token bridging to the underlying network bridge. Messaging protocols generally work with ERC-20 transfers, meaning a custom implementation would be required for network gas tokens. A native bridge allows for a more streamlined approach, embedding gas token bridging into the network’s primary liquidity bridge and does not introduce new attack surfaces or security assumptions.\n\nThe framework can be made compatible with Aave’s broader GHO cross-chain strategy by integrating messaging protocols into the native bridge, aligning with the existing cross-chain implementation, where Chainlink CCIP is the canonical messaging layer for GHO as an ERC-20 token.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe framework defines the architecture for adopting GHO as a gas token across L2 networks. It outlines how the native bridge operates as the primary liquidity pool for GHO minting, embedding security and liquidity management directly into the network’s base infrastructure. The approach limits fragmentation across multiple bridges and reduces dependency on external liquidity providers. Future governance decisions could introduce more granular controls over bridging frameworks to refine security and liquidity strategies.\n\n![Aave Governance Post - Launch](ipfs://bafkreifha2iuewownclabkvxm6ve4ik6blx66iodazlqg3ubrfu5gckzce)\n\n\nInstead of locking the framework into any specific messaging protocol, the design remains modular, allowing for future integrations. If messaging protocols become natively supported by canonical bridges, governance can set parameters to manage liquidity distribution and bridging constraints.\n\nThe [GHO Wrapper contract](https://github.com/aave/gho-wrapper) on Ethereum mainnet provides flexibility for upgrades and extensions without modifying the core bridge infrastructure. The contract has been audited by [Pashov Audit Group](https://www.pashov.net/). It allows for upgrading implementations of the underlying GHO token or supporting additional innovation in the future. This modular design makes it possible to introduce new functionalities without disrupting the existing bridge and minting architecture.\n\nSourcing liquidity on the destination chain requires careful consideration of how GHO is introduced and maintained in the network. GHO is minted on Ethereum and bridged to the destination chain as needed, meaning liquidity only enters circulation when the remote facilitator puts it into use. This follows GHO’s cross-chain strategy, where all liquidity originates on Ethereum.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis framework lays the groundwork for adopting GHO as a gas token across multiple networks. It provides a structured approach to liquidity management while allowing for future expansions, including governance-controlled messaging integrations, modifications to bridging on Ethereum, and mechanisms to enable liquidity to be pre-minted on destination chains. The Aave community is invited to contribute to refining this framework.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.",

This expansion will utilize Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). After extensive discussions concerning the cross-chain token model, the bridge, and potential networks, we are presenting this vote which gives final snapshot approval on the whole strategy, based on previous discussions and risk parameters provided by Chaos Labs.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe current accessibility of GHO, primarily through minting on the Ethereum mainnet or via secondary markets, significantly limits its potential reach and utility within the DeFi landscape. Transitioning to a cross-chain model will enhance GHO’s accessibility and liquidity, appealing to a broader userbase. Additionally, integrating with alternative chains could greatly improve the overall user experience by offering faster transactions and reduced costs, thus making GHO a more attractive financial tool. This shift also presents new opportunities within the ecosystem of each network, allowing access to a wide array of integrations with other protocols and tools, further enriching GHO’s utility and appeal.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nBelow are the main actions to address, and the AIP will provide full implementation and details. For a detailed overview of specifications see the ARFC post [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-cross-chain-launch/17616#specification-3).\n\n1. Implement a lock-and-mint model for cross-chain GHO Token, where all liquidity is originated from Ethereum.\n2. Deploy an upgradable version of GHO Token on Arbitrum network.\n3. Integrate GHO Token with CCIP TokenPool contracts utilizing lock-and-release pool on Ethereum and mint-and-burn pool on Arbitrum.\n4. Enroll CCIP TokenPool on Arbitrum as GHO Token Facilitator.\n5. Add GHO into the Arbitrum Aave pool as a borrowable asset.\n6. Configure CCIP TokenPool Rate Limits and Aggregate Rate Limits.\n\n# **Next Steps**\n\nOnce the community votes with a successful snapshot, prepare for AIP.",

        "body": "## Summary\nThis Snapshot aims to officially capture the community's agreement on adopting Chainlink Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to initiate the GHO cross-chain strategy. The details of the rollout plan and the configuration of risk parameters remain subjects for future governance discussions.\n\n## Motivation\nThe current limitation of GHO, which is primarily accessible only via minting on the Ethereum mainnet or through secondary markets, represents a significant constraint in its potential reach and utility across DeFi. We believe the future of GHO is to become a multichain asset where users can interact across various networks using GHO. Moving cross-chain increases the accessibility and liquidity of GHO for a larger spectrum of users.\n\nThe current moment is ideal for GHO to venture into new frontiers, and to facilitate this, it is essential to employ a solution that empowers users and stimulates growth. CCIP stands out for its high-speed and cost-effective token bridging, extensible compatibility to both EVM and non-EVM networks, ease of integration, and robust risk mechanisms. Aave Labs suggests implementing a canonical, unified cross-chain strategy for GHO using Chainlink's CCIP.\n\n## Specification\nAave Labs proposes using Chainlink [CCIP infrastructure](https://docs.chain.link/ccip) to move GHO across blockchain networks. This will allow the seamless transfer of the GHO token between source and destination networks. CCIP transfers tokens by locking/burning on the source chain and then releasing/minting on the destination network. Cross-chain GHO uses a combination of lock/release and mint/burn models, backing the aggregated liquidity across chains with locked GHO on Ethereum. Every destination chain will have a canonical version of the GHO token and an Aave Governance controlled facilitator with a specific bucket capacity.\n- Transferring GHO from Ethereum to another chain: GHO tokens get locked in a vault contract on Ethereum, GHO tokens get minted via Facilitator on the destination chain.\n- Transferring GHO from another chain to Ethereum: GHO tokens get burned via Facilitator on the other chain, GHO tokens get released from the vault contract on Ethereum.\n- Transfering GHO from one chain to another (none of them are Ethereum): GHO tokens get burned via Facilitator on source chain, minted via Facilitator on destination chain.\n\n![examples-ccip.png](ipfs://bafkreih46kvo7rrl4ylyobxyiqxis2kvplo7tqd223fje5zm2nooeut3eu)\n\nEach network will have a canonical version of GHO and a facilitator, controlled by Aave Governance, that will manage facilitator buckets and onboard GHO liquidity from Ethereum. The liquidity on each network will depend on the bucket capacity of the Facilitator and CCIP configuration (e.g. [rate limit](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/architecture#token-pool-rate-limit)). The total amount of liquidity across chains is always less than or equal to the amount of GHO tokens locked on Ethereum.\n\n## Next Steps\nOnce the community signals its consent for the implementation of CCIP to initiate the cross-chain strategy for GHO, the subsequent actions will be undertaken:\n- Initiate technical implementation process\n- Perform a thorough technical review to select the optimal networks for deployment.\n- Formulate a strategic rollout plan for the GHO cross-chain approach, in partnership with Risk Providers.",

        "body": "## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 13/09/2024\n\n# Summary\n\n[Superlend](https://www.superlend.xyz/) is building a lending and borrowing aggregator platform that allows users to manage their positions across multiple chains and protocols, always accessing the best APRs for lending and the lowest rates for borrowing. The Superlend project was Initially conceived during the [Etherlink Accelerator in Singapore](https://medium.com/etherlink/the-future-of-defi-insights-from-dca-in-singapore-d543477cdbe6) as a lending and borrowing platform on [Etherlink](https://www.etherlink.com/).\n\nSuperlend's goals include launching their own dedicated money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, while also integrating Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem, such as on Ethereum, Base, and Polygon, into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they are planning to deploy an instance of Aave V3 that will exclusively support ETH and ETH-correlated assets (such as LRTs and LSTs), similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. These deployments and integrations will enable users to seamlessly manage their positions within the robust and secure Aave framework, while also allowing Superlend to offer innovative cross-chain liquidity management features. Additional details for the Arbitrum proposal will be provided in the future as they finalize the risk parameters and asset selection. Leveraging Aave's well-audited and secure infrastructure allows them to accelerate their development without compromising on security, avoiding the complexities and costs associated with building from scratch.\n\nIn recognition of the value provided by the Aave community, Superlend proposes a revenue-sharing model, committing to share 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave V3 codebase has established itself as a cornerstone in the DeFi ecosystem, renowned for its reliability, security, and quality. Successful projects like the Spark Protocol and RealT further affirm Aave's technology and reputation. Superlend's objectives are twofold: launching their own innovative money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, and integrating the various Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (such as those on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to deploy an instance of Aave V3 focused exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to the Lido instance that Aave has deployed on Ethereum. By doing so, they aim to provide users with a cohesive experience that leverages the strength of Aave's framework while also showcasing the unique features and innovations that Superlend can bring to the market.\n\nOne of Superlend's other motivations for deploying on Etherlink and Arbitrum-like chains using the Aave V3 codebase is to enable a feature for their aggregator that allows users to keep their USDC in the best APY protocol across chains with a single click. After extensive testing with the LayerZero-like cross-chain protocol Across+, as well as flash-loan scripts, they discovered that integrating an Aave deployment with the Portal feature activated, along with a third-party bridge provider, could allow users to move their USDC positions from Compound on Arbitrum to Aave on Optimism seamlessly. In this scenario, Superlend markets can serve as a \"temporary station\" where liquidity is parked for a few seconds during the transfer. Before making such a feature live, they would, of course, share it first in the forum and seek feedback when it's ready.\n\nSuperlend's vision aligns with deploying \"friendly\" forks of Aave V3, customized for specific use cases and ecosystems, and integrating these Aave V3 deployments by the Aave DAO as a prominent part of their aggregator. Keeping the open-source ethos at the forefront, they believe it is fair and respectful to seek the Aave community's approval first, ensuring a mutually beneficial path forward for both Aave and Superlend.\n\nAs Aave continues to explore areas like off-chain collateral and new developments such as GHO, projects like Superlend have the opportunity to add value and drive the adoption of Aave's technology. Their proposal to deploy an Aave V3 fork on Etherlink and Arbitrum represents a strategic opportunity to extend Aave's influence within the rapidly evolving cross-chain DeFi landscape. In appreciation of this opportunity, they propose a revenue-sharing model to ensure mutual benefit from this collaboration.\n\nSuperlend has confirmed plans to allocate a portion of its community token supply towards a potential airdrop or distribution specifically for stkAAVE holders, and they wish to leverage the existing set of holders and delegates, aligning with AAVE DAO's governance model. Specific details will be announced closer to the event. Currently, Superlend's priority remains product development and refinement.\n\n# Specification\n\n### Market Deployment\n\n- **Aave V3 Codebase:** Superlend will deploy their money markets on Etherlink and Arbitrum using the Aave V3 codebase. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to focus exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. Additionally, there could be a second market on Arbitrum dedicated to USDC or similar assets to support their cross-chain liquidity management feature, which would use the Aave Portal feature. These markets will operate independently from their aggregator platform but will be fully integrated within the Superlend ecosystem. These deployments are integral to both their goal of launching innovative Superlend markets and their broader strategy to integrate the existing Aave V3 markets deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (e.g., on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator.\n    - Test their proposed deployment that they have live on Etherlink testnet [here](https://testnet.superlend.xyz/).\n    - Find the addresses of their deployed contracts on the testnet [here](https://www.notion.so/Testnet-deploy-sequence-addresses-fd6c3707ece94aabab61d8498a638775?pvs=21).\n- **Revenue Sharing:** Superlend proposes sharing 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO, provided that their quarterly revenue exceeds $200,000. These contributions will be made on a quarterly basis.\n\n### Governance and Risk Management\n\n- **Governance Model:** Initially, the markets will be governed through a 5/8 multi-sig model. As the project matures, they plan to transition to a more decentralized governance structure, aligning with the principles of Aave's governance model.\n- **Risk Management:** Superlend has partnered with [ChainRisk](https://www.chainrisk.xyz/) for continuous risk parameter tuning and will onboard additional partners as needed to ensure comprehensive risk management for these markets.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on the ARFC, escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is favorable, Superlend markets will be deployed on Etherlink and Arbitrum, adhering to the revenue-sharing and governance commitments outlined.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] BUIDL GSM\nAuthor: @aavelabs\nDate: 2024-09-04\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis Temp Check proposes to build and deploy GHO Stability Module (GSM) to support reserve allocation and management features enabling third party integrations, specifically supporting integration into the BlackRock BUIDL 90 infrastructure.\n\n## Motivation\nThe primary purpose of GHO Stability Module (GSM) is to ensure the stability of GHO in scenarios of increasing or decreasing demand, effectively providing 1:1 convertibility between GHO and the other asset within the specific GSM. In the case of GHO:USDC, this can result in a surplus of USDC that in current deployed implementation remains idle.\n\nAave Labs proposes to build a new instance of GSM that supports external integrations and related control mechanisms, specifically supporting BlackRock’s BUIDL. With this implementation GSM can be more capital efficient while maintaining the high standards of backing as USDC is backing the GHO.\n\nBUIDL 25 is deployed on the Ethereum network, providing onchain access to traditional financial assets managed by BlackRock Financial Management Inc., with BNY Mellon as custodian, Securitize as transfer agent, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the appointed fund auditor. BUIDL offers a novel approach to the digital asset space by combining the reliability of traditional financial mechanisms with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology.\n\nBlackRock has partnered with Coinbase, Anchorage, Fireblocks, and Digital Bank NA as infrastructure providers, and with Circle for the onchain USDC redemption fund, ensuring instant liquidity for onchain participants.\n\nBUIDL is priced at $1 per token and pays daily accrued dividends directly to holders wallets in the form of new tokens each month. The fund allocates 100% of its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, allowing holders to earn yield while holding the token on the blockchain. BUIDL holders can transfer their tokens 24/7/365 to other pre-approved holders. Additionally, fund participants have flexible custody options, allowing them to choose how to hold their tokens.\n\nThe BUIDL fund currently has over $500 million in issuance 10, with Circle providing a $100 million USDC redemption fund that guarantees conversion from BUIDL back into USDC for use in the USDC GSM. As of now, the redemption fund has $74.7 million USDC available.\n\nThis GSM implementation sets the technical ability for the Aave DAO, essentially expanding yield sources into real-world assets (RWAs), and increasing the partnership opportunities with BlackRock. Additionally, it provides a hedge against fluctuating yield opportunities in DeFi markets.\n\n## Specification\nThe proposed GSM instance that will run in parallel with already existing GSMs, will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO, utilizing the USDC surplus to mint BUIDL tokens. Thanks to instant redeemability between USDC and BUIDL, the GSM can mint and burn BUIDL in exchange for USDC based on user demand, ensuring a seamless experience similar to the existing GHO:USDC GSM. Swap fees will be accumulated in GHO, and dividends will be paid monthly in BUIDL.\n\nArchitecture may or may not integrate a USDC buffer to compensate the gas redemption cost of BUIDL for small swaps, subject to further evaluation.\n\nThe GSM contract code requires modifications to support GHO <> USDC conversions and dividend reception. Additionally, BUIDL holders must be registered/allowlisted, meaning the GSM itself must also be registered.\n\nA detailed specification will be shared during the ARFC phase.\n\n## Next Steps\nIf Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.",
