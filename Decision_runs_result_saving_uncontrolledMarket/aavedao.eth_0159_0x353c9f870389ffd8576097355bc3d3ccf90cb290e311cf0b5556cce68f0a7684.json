        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Launch aUSDC GSM on Ethereum\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-10-18\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying a new aUSDC GHO Stability Module (GSM) and migrating USDC from the existing GSM on Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAfter a successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb800d3ab766305fd57389101bc475f0220a8bd47699b0f850eec115f31ca22ee), the existing USDC GSM is to be replaced with an aUSDC GSM. Migrating to an aUSDC GSM is expected to improve the overall investment prospects of GHO by introducing a new aToken revenue stream for the DAO. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 19.56.00](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1H0cN3J1g.png)\n\nWith 8M of USDC from the existing GSM deposited into Aave v3, it would represent less than 10% of the available liquidity in the USDC Reserve. With sufficient growth upside remaining for the aUSDC GSM on Ethereum, the DAO can increase the amount of USDC backing GHO. In addition, separate instances of non USDC aToken GSMs can be deployed to diversify GHO's collateral across other reserves on Aave.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 19.22.47](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByubX43kkx.png)\n\nThe existing GSM implementation has USDC exposure capacity set at 8M units. When combined with another 8M of USDT, this represents over 10% of GHO's supply not generating any revenue for the DAO. The GHO Stewards elected to not pursue increasing the Exposure Capacity of USDC and USDT to encourage new GHO entering circulating supply via the main market. As a result, GHO traded above peg and it tooks several weeks for newly borrowed GHO to enter circulating supply.\n\nWith the introduction of yield generating assets within the GSM, the GHO Stewards are much more likely to increase the Bucket Capacity and Exposure Capacity of the aToken GSMs to support newly minted GHO entering circulating supply. This is expected to enable GHO to grow more freely whilst partially mitigating GHO trading above/bellow peg. In addition, the more capital is accrued there, the better safeguarded from an extended de-peg GHO is. GSM protects deviations on both sides\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below details the configuration of the aUSDC GSM.\n\n| Parameter                | Value  | \n| ------------------------ | :----: | \n| Bucket Capacity (GHO)     | 16.00M |\n| Exposure Capacity (USDC) |  8.00M |\n| Price Strategy           |  1:1   |\n| Freeze Lower Bound       | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound       | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee             |  0.00% |\n| Burn GHO Fee             |  0.20% | \n\nThe Exposure Capacity is to be increased by the GHO Stewards upon successful upgrade/migration.\n\nThe previous version of the USDC GSM is to be disabled and all liquidity migrated to the new version.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

While these two capacity increases fall under the Direct-to-AIP process, other future increases are not pre-approved and follow the ARFC process.\n\nTo facilitate the streamlining of GHO adoption on Arbitrum and other deployments beyond Ethereum, this publication proposes adjusting the following parameters to be included within the Direct-to-AIP process. \n\n* GHO Reserve Borrow Rate\n* CCIP Bridge\n* GHO Stability Module(s)\n* GHO Reserve funded exclusively from new facilitator on Ethereum\n\nThe Direct-to-AIP governance process enables the DAO to implement upgrades faster and more closely track market conditions. AIP votes will still be required until such time as the GHO Steward role is fully extended to support the new parameter adjustments not currently covered by the Risk Steward role.\n\nFor clarification, the following parameter adjustments are to continue following the ARFC process:\n\n* Safety Module emission rates\n* New GHO deployments\n* GHO Reserve Factor\n\nNote, risk parameters such as Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and the ability to freeze a reserve are already approved as Direct-to-AIP with the implementation performed by the Risk Steward role.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis publication grants approval to adjust the following GHO related parameters via the Direct-to-AIP process.\n\n* GHO Reserve Borrow Rate\n* CCIP Bridge\n* GHO Stability Module(s)\n* GHO Reserve funded exclusively from new facilitator on Ethereum\n\nThis proposal covers the recent GHO on Arbitrum deployment and also, future GHO deployments beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy USDC and USDT GSM On Arbitrum\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-06-30\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying a USDC and USDT GHO Stability Module (GSM) on the Arbitrum network. The two GSMs are to be maintained by the GHO Stewards.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe GSM provides stability to the GHO peg by enabling assets to be exchanged within a defined price band. Deploying a GSM on the Arbitrum network enables swaps to be filled without unnecessarily creating an arbitrage opportunity between networks. \n\nWith the LTIPP ARB grant coinciding with GHO being launched on Arbtirum, the Aave DAO can stimulate demand for GHO whilst also restricting the Bridge Facilitator mint cap to encourage users to mint GHO via the GSMs. User will also be able to swap USDC and USDT for GHO via aggregators that have integrated the GSM. This will lead to USDC and USDT being deposited into the GSM.\n\nWith a healthy balance of USDC and USDT in each respective GSM, the Bridge Facilitator cap can be raised more aggressively and a GHO Bucket Cap with Facilitor role can be introduced to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. \n\n# Specification\n\n\nThe below outline the proposed changes to be included in the governance proposal submission.\n\n## Ethereum\n\n### Arbitrum Focused Facilitator\n\n| Parameter  |     Value      | \n|    ---     |     :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units  | \n\n### CCIP Bucket Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|    ---     |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n## Arbitrum\n\n### CCIP Facilitator Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|     ---    |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n### GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the USDC and USDT GSMs that will be updated by the GHO Stewards post launch.\n\n| Parameter                         | Value   | \n| ------------------------             | :----:     | \n| Freeze Lower Bound        | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound        | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee                   | 0.05% |\n| Burn GHO Fee                  | 0.20% | \n| Supply Cap                       | 1.00M  |\n\nAny deviation from the above will be shared in the comments section below prior to the AIP being submited for vote.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

The current instance of the GSMs issue GHO into circulating supply and offer no additional revenue beyond the fee for interacting with the GSM. To date, both GSMs have generated a combined 21.9K USD in fees. \n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidxpse554hufcrksjc2you63l3abqnublk4h4cyg6inwdsquvomdy)\n    \nWith only 16M of combined USDC and USDT in the GSMs, the opportunity cost of holding aTokens in the GSM to date is 138.5k for the Aave DAO. However, during more recent times when GHO has been trading above peg and both GSMs have reached there Exposure Caps, the daily opportunity cost in lost yield is ~1.6k, which is equivalent to ~575k when annualised.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifay4gngo2u65tapm7brryjh22qrrt7smxbitkqlj6sjl7ezxrnma)\n    \nThe proposed GSMs will enable funds held within the GSM to earn yield and for this yield to go the DAO's treasury. Due to the enhanced capital efficiency, the USDC Exposure and GHO Bucket Capacity of the GSM can be sized based upon the lesser of the following:\n\n* Preferred amount of USDC exposure; or,\n* Available exit liquidity in the USDC reserve.\n\nEither of the above options, compares favourably when determining GSM parameters relative to configuring the Exposure Capacity for peg stability. If additional capacity is needed, a USDT aToken GSM can be deployed. \n\nThe aToken yield acts as a proxy for Borrow Rate on the Aave v3 market. Meaning GHO Minted from the GSM generates aUSDC yield and GHO Borrowed on Aave v3 generates interest. The aUSDC revenue is available every block as it accrues, unlike the interest accruing from GHO debt which Aave only receives if the user repays their loan.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposed instance of the GSM is intended to replace the existing USDC GSM, will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO and utilizes the USDC surplus to mint aEthUSDC tokens. \n\naEthUSDC is instantly redeemable for USDC within the main Aave v3 deployment on Ethereum. The GSM can mint and burn aEthUSDC in exchange for USDC based upon user demand. \n\nSwap fees will be accumulated in GHO and surplus aEthUSDC will be claimable. A bot will be deployed to periodically claim the revenue to the DAO's treasury. \n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkU3-Tp6R.png)\n\nA detailed specification will be shared during the ARFC phase.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Lido Instance - wstETH Slope1 & Uoptimal Update\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-09-16\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes improving the capital efficiency of the wstETH Reserve on the Lido instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum by increasing Uoptimal from 45.00% to 80.00% and reducing the Slope1 from 3.50% to 2.25%.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal recommends revising the wstETH borrow rate ahead of the introduction of Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) and the creation of several new eModes on the Lido instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum.\n\nThe upcoming Liquid eModes upgrade will allow a single asset to be included in multiple eModes. As we onboard various LRTs, our goal is to promote the use of wstETH as a debt asset to enhance the returns of the wstETH/wETH yield strategy.\n\nBy increasing the Uoptimal of the wstETH reserve, we can significantly improve its capital efficiency. Strategists using LRTs as collateral and borrowing wstETH to generate yield will be able to borrow a larger portion of the wstETH that in turn generates a wstETH deposit yield.\n\nThe wstETH deposit yield will offset the wETH borrowing costs. Depending on market conditions, this could lead to a future proposal that fine-tunes the wETH and wstETH Slope1 parameters to balance the wETH deposit yield, revenue, and the performance of the wstETH/ETH yield strategy. Optimizing these parameters is expected to significantly reduce the payback period on the Lido instance and improve the DAO’s overall return on investment.\n\nA separate proposal will provide details on the new eMode configurations being introduced to the Lido instance of Aave v3. This publication focuses specifically on optimizing the wstETH Uoptimal to improve capital efficiency in preparation for LRT onboarding.\n\nWhilst several teams are expected to offer incentives for strategies involving LRT collateral and wstETH debt, general market conditions are not sufficiently buoyant to support retaining the current 3.50% Slope1 parameter.\n\nWhilst we expect strong demand for wstETH debt from users wanting to leverage farm LRT point incentives. Our research indicates sufficient demand emerges when the Slope1 is within the 2.00% to 2.50% range. As a result, this publication proposes reducing the Slope1 from 3.50% to 2.25%.\n\nBy revising the Slope1 and Uoptimal configuration for the wstETH reserve, we expect LRT deposits to drive significant AUM growth for the Lido instance.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe Lido instance wstETH Slope1 and Uoptimal are to be revised as follows:\n\n|Description|Current|Proposed| Change   |\n| --------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |\n|Slope1     | 3.50% |   2.25%|  -1.25%  |\n|Uopitimal  | 45.00%|  80.00%|  35.00%  |\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will implement proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "The proposal aims to deploy a new GHO Facilitator on Ethereum to support GHO expansion across multiple networks, starting with a 5M GHO deposit into Aave v3 on Arbitrum.
