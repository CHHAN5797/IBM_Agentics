        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Increase GHO Borrow Rate\n## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n## Date: 2023-08-23\n---\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes an increase in the borrow rate of GHO from the current rate of 1.5% to 2.5%. The aim is to address the peg deviation of GHO and ensure its growth and trustworthiness in the market.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nGHO has witnessed a rapid growth, reaching a circulating supply of 22M in just a few weeks since its launch. One of the primary reasons for this growth, especially in the current adverse market conditions, is the GHO borrow rate set below the market price of stablecoin borrows. This low rate, combined with the current lack of holding venues and the inability to use GHO as collateral, has made single-side liquidity provision in stableswaps, such as Balancer pools, [one of the most sought-after strategies.](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity)\n\nWhile deep liquidity and growth are desired as a go-to-market strategy for GHO, the peg deviation of GHO (currently around $0.975) is affecting its growth and trust in the market. A consensus short-term solution to this issue is to slightly raise the GHO borrow rate from 1.5% to 2.5%. This rate remains attractive for borrowers and is still below the market average rates. However, by reducing the discount, it is anticipated to have a positive effect.\n\nThis proposal is particularly relevant in the context of the potential [sDAI onboarding integration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sdai-aave-v3-onboarding/14410). This integration is expected to add short-term sell pressure on GHO, especially with the current borrow rate, which could further harm the GHO peg.\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Asset**: GHO\n- **Contract Address**: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f\n- **Current Borrow Rate**: 1.5%\n- **Proposed Borrow Rate**: 2.5%\n- **New discounted Borrow Rate**: ~1.75%\n\n## Disclamer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, implement the proposed changes to the GHO borrow rate.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The proposed risk parameters for LUSD will mirror those currently in place for USDC on the same pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by users of the Liquity Protocol. It has demonstrated its resilience and maintained a stable peg, even in volatile market conditions. By adding LUSD as a collateral asset on the Aave V3 ETH pool, we can offer our users more options for their DeFi activities. Furthermore, the integration of LUSD could potentially synergize with the GHO, enhancing liquidity and further reinforcing the stability of the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed risk parameters for LUSD on the Aave V3 ETH pool are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 77% |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 80% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 4.5% |\n\nThese parameters are identical to those currently in place for USDC on the Aave V3 ETH pool.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173/13) program, the ACI has not been compensated by any third-party to present this ARFC.\nAt the time of writing, the author does not hold LQTY tokens but owns some LUSD.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP for final approval and implementation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] TUSD Offboarding Plan Part II\nAuthor: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative  \nDate: 2023-09-17\n--\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC proposes the continuation of the [TUSD offboarding plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-tusd-offboarding-plan/14008) from Aave V2 by adjusting its risk parameters, mirroring the approach taken in the \"[ARFC] BUSD Offboarding Plan Part III\".\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of stablecoins offboarding of the Aave V2 market.\nTUSD is proposed to adopt the \"final stage\" offboarding parameters to incentivize repayment and withdrawal of liquidity in Aave V2 Pool\n\naBUSD will be withdrawn and converted to BUSD.\n\nThis ARFC also aims to authorize the ACI to publish regularly \"withdraw aToken\" mechanical AIPs that have low governance value. Part of the success of these offboarding plans relies on maintaining the available liquidity low, adding pressure on borrowers, and incentivizing repayment or, if there's a lack of reaction, accelerating HF decay to create liquidations.\n\nWe believe that once the governance approves the offboarding plans and once an asset reaches the \"final\" stage of interestStrategy curve, there's little to no governance value in going through the snapshot phase each time. A direct-to-AIP approach seems sufficient. \n\n## Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters Adjustment\n\nThe risk parameters for TUSD on Aave V2 will be adjusted as follows:\n\n| Parameter              | Previous Value | New Value |\n|------------------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)    | 0%             | 0%       |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 75%       | 65%      |\n| Liquidation Bonus      | 10%            | 10%      |\n| Reserve Factor         | 95%            | 99.9%    |\n| uOptimal               | 20%              | 1%       |\n| Base Rate              | 0%              | 100%     |\n| Slope 1                | 10%              | 70%      |\n| Slope 2                | 200%              | 300%     |\n\n## Disclamer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If community consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage\n3. if snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value (USDT) | Proposed Value (USDT) | Current Value (USDC) |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| LTV       | 0%                   | 74%                  | 74%                  |\n| LT        | 0%                   | 76%                  | 76%                  |\n| LB        | 0%                   | 4.5%                 | 4.5%                 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the ARFC Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This would be achieved by integrating sDAI, an ERC-4626 Vault token that includes the DSR yield, into the Aave protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DSR is a variable rate set by MakerDAO governance that allows DAI holders to earn savings by locking their DAI into the DSR contract. Recently, MakerDAO governance plans to increase the DSR rate to 3.49%. By integrating the DSR into Aave via sDAI, we can allow Aave liquidity providers to benefit from the DSR rate without additional cost to the Aave DAI borrowers.\n\n## Specification\n\nAt the protocol level, when a user deposits DAI, the protocol will wrap their DAI in the form of sDAI and deliver aDAI to the user. When a user borrows DAI, the protocol will unwrap the stored sDAI, deliver DAI, and accrue the debt amount in DAI.\n\n![image|1920x1563, 40%](upload://fQNJl46MrGPtwEuH6Trg6zzyqNP.jpeg)\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis integration will have the consequence of increasing the gas cost of using DAI in Aave for every user. The exact impact of these gas cost increases should be reviewed and considered by the community during the ARFC stage of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK receives positive feedback and a Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, the next step would be to draft an ARFC\ndetailing the technical implementation of this integration.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not paid by makerDAO or any third party to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "The proposal seeks to increase the GHO borrow rate from 2.5% to 3% to strengthen the GHO peg and enhance protocol revenue. Voting timeline metrics show unanimous early and stable support for 'YAE'. Forum sentiment is mixed but leans positive in favor of the rate increase, recognizing it as a necessary step to maintain peg stability and protocol health. Historical similar proposals also passed with positive market and TVL reactions, supporting this approach.",
    "key_arguments_for": [
      "Increasing the borrow rate helps strengthen the GHO peg, improving price stability.",
      "Higher borrow rates generate additional revenue for the protocol.",
      "Maintains GHO borrowing competitiveness relative to other stablecoins.",
      "Provides a coordinated approach with other initiatives to support GHO."
    ],
    "key_arguments_against": [
      "Frequent parameter changes may reduce borrower confidence and trust.",
      "The borrow rate is operational and ideally should be automated, not governance-controlled.",
      "Increases may hurt GHO growth in the short term.",
      "Some users experience a loss of trust due to the variable 'fixed rate' promise."
