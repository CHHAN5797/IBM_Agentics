This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH.\n\nLSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.\n\nOnboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.\n\nAave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.\n\nRocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem.\n\nSpecification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal.\nIncreasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions.\n\nthe ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators.\nRocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH\nrETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH.\nThe rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time.\nSimply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.\nWithout a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.\nRocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold.\nAbstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nrETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.\nrETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.\nrETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.\nrETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.\nrETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years.\nThe Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021.\nrETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2\nThe Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool — Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2\n5. How is the rETH token currently used?\n\nBalancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M\n\nUniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity\n\nrETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI\n\nimage\nimage\n1231×203 17.2 KB\nIt’s likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding.\n\nSee the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\nrETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\nThe Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities.\n8.

Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.\n\nBorrowable - Yes\n\nWe are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aave’s markets.\n\nLT - 74%; LTV 67%\n\nWe recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we’ve identified above.\n\nLB - 7.5%\n\nWe recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH.\n\nRF - 15%\n\nLPF - 0.1\n\nDebt Ceiling - NA\n\nSupply Cap - 10K\n\nBorrow Cap - 1200\n\nOur analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets.\n\n| Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap |\n| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |\n| rETH   | NO             | YES        | YES                | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A         | 10K       | 1200      |\n\n\n## Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor\n\nrETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later.\n\nParameter | Recommendation\n--------- | -------------\nBase | 0\nSlope 1 | 0.07\nUoptimal | 0.45\nSlope 2 | 3.0\nReserve Factor | 0.15\n\nUnder these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI). From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Polygon v2 to v3 Liquidity Migration \nAuthor: TokenLogic @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2023-03-18\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nTokenLogic presents an opportunity to help kick start the migration from v2 to v3 by capitalising on the favourable conditions presented by the imminent multi-token liquidity mining program on the Polygon v3 market.\n\n# Abstract\n\nOn Polygon, there are two Aave deployments in production and the majority of the liquidity is deposited into the obsolete v2 deployment. With Chainlink expected to monetise oracles, v2 partially frozen and several communities about to distribute rewards on v3, this publication seeks to further encourage the migration of users from v2 to v3.\n\nWith SD, LDO, stMATIC and MaticX rewards to be flowing across the v3 deployment imminently, Aave is presented with an incredibly unique set of conditions that offer an ideal opportunity for further encouraging the onboarding of users onto the v3 deployment. The lion share of TVL on Polygon v2 could be migrated with simple changes presented within.\n\nThis publication provides initial parameter changes supportive of encouraging the migration of funds without putting any users' positions at risk of liquidation. Users with debt positions are encouraged to migrate to reduce borrowing costs and users with deposits are encouraged to migrate to receive a higher deposit rate.\n\nThis initiative is open for discussion and will be changed to reflect the evolving discussion in the comments section below. The key consideration here is the oversized upside realized by acting early during the liquidity mining campaign.  \n\n# Motivation\n\nIn recent months, Llama’s has coordinated across several teams to bring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and rewards to the Polygon v3 deployment. Stader Labs is currently distributing SD rewards, with Lido DAO and Polygon Foundation expected to commence distributing LDO, MaticX and stMATIC rewards in the very near future. Next week, cough.\n\nNormally, with rewards being distributed across the Aave v3 deployment, usage and therefore deposit rates are expected to increase. However, on this occasion, incentives are not expected to be applied to stable coin deposits and the higher deposit rate on stable coins will need to be demand driven. \n\nCurrently, Aave v2 offers higher deposit rates and higher borrowing rates on 2 of 3 major stable coins. Table 1 below compares the three main stable coins. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoyNytW.png)\n\nFor stable coin deposit rates to increase on v3, the liquidity mining will be reliant on wMATIC, stMATIC and MaticX deposits being used as collateral to borrow stable coins. With this approach to liquidity mining, some demand for borrowing stable coins is expected on v3, but it is not certain and it creates the need for further action from the Aave community to encourage migration.\n\nThis proposed upgrade, coinciding with the lucrative incentive campaign on v3, is intended to further encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3 by reducing the v2 deployments capital efficiency. V2 will remain very much functional and supportive of communities to migrate to v3 on their timeline. \n\nFor reserves where the utilization is less than the Uoptimal value, this proposal seeks to update the Uoptimal parameter to be the midpoint between current utilization and Uoptimal value. This will lead to higher borrowing costs, estimated to be around 35% higher (borrow interest 2.37% to 2.96%) on average for the main stable coins, and if the RF is not adjusted, will lead to higher deposit rates. By increasing the RF, from 10% to around 30%, the additional interest that would have been received by depositors will be redirected to Aave’s Collector Contract. As a result, deposit rates will not meaningfully change on v2 and borrow rates increase.\n\nIf/when the liquidity mining on v3 leads to higher borrowing cost, if no action is taken on v2, v2 will offer the lowest borrowing rates. For assets like wETH, BTC and AAVE being used as collateral to borrow stable coins there will be no incentive to migrate to v3. By increasing borrowing rates on v2, the v3 deployment will remain more competitive when utilization on comparable reserves are similar, see Table 2. In fact, the v3 deployment can have higher utilization and still offer a lower cost of capital which gives v3 a competitive advantage over v2, see Table 3.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/csUT2wP.png)\n\nIf just the RF was increased on v2, then deposit rates on v2 would reduce and borrowing which is already slightly more expensive relative to v3 would remain unchanged, thus providing no additional incentive for borrowers to migrate. This is especially true for those that have deposited wMATIC, wETH or wBTC and borrowed stable coins. Thus the need to increase borrowing costs on v2 relative to v3.\n\nBy decreasing the Uoptimal value, the capital efficiency of the reserves is reduced and with each redemption/deposit (removal of liquidity) the borrowing rate will be more sensitive as the gradient of the first portion of the interest rate curve is slightly steeper. Each larger redemption, withdrawal of liquidity, will cause borrow rates to increase that bit more than otherwise which continues to encourage migration over time.\n\nTo continually adjust the Uoptimal lower would be a rather aggressive approach towards migrating users. Until the timeline around when Chainlink intends to begin charging for oracles, future changes may focus on reducing the deposit rate by adjusting the RF over time. For frozen assets, adjusting the RF appears to be the most effective way forward as it was shown to be successful when applied to FEI.\n\nAs rewards being distributed on Aave v3 are finite (bear market) and for a limited amount of time (3 months), the time to initiate the migration from v2 to v3 is now. With any luck, the rewards will lead to a lot of funds migrating and this proposal then ensures v2 offers higher borrow costs relative to v3 which further encourages migration. There is a risk here that the borrow cost increase proposed in this proposal is too subtle. However, this is not intended to be a mass migration push proposal but instead a smaller change that compliments the v3 liquidity mining program to Aave benefit. \n\nFollow up proposals can further adjust Upotimal values once utilization on reserves like USDT have reverted back to more normal conditions.\n\n### Uoptimal Parameter\n\nThis publication splits the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal values. Ie: If utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%, the midpoint between the existing utilization and Uoptimal value.\n\n### Slope 2 Parameter\n\nBy reducing the Uoptimal parameter, the gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100% is lowered. In order to maintain the current gradient, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher. In the image below, Slope 2 changes from 75% to 150% in response to the Uoptimal parameter being reduced from 80% to 60%. Notice how the red and blue lines are parallel during the second leg of the curve, this is because they have the same gradient. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ojX6SLn.png)\n\n### Reserve Factor\n\nAs a portion of the interest paid by borrowers is directed to users who provide liquidity, by increasing the borrow rate, the deposit rate also increases assuming the reserves utilization remains unchanged. To counter the higher deposit rate, which encourages more deposits, the RF is increased.  This redirects  interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors. The table in the Specification section outlines how each RF is adjusted to keep the deposit rate mostly unchanged despite the higher borrow rates. \n\nDue to abnormally high USDT usage, 84.51% at the time of writing, this proposal suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs. The justification for this is to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, such that it encourages migration whilst avoiding reducing the Uoptimal such that borrowing cost increases substantially by shifting utilizing onto the more stepper portion of the yield curve. When utilization drops by a material amount, it would be prudent to reduce the Uoptiomal value in line with other stable coins. \n\n# Specification\n\nTable 4 below presents the current asset configuration on Polygon v2.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/An2aWJq.png)\n\nBased upon the methodology presented above, Table 5 details the parameter changes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2gqgoQr.png)\n\nDo note, the parameters to be changed have been rounded to nearest whole number and no Uoptimal was increased.\n\nPior to any AIP submission the numbers should be updated in line with the strategy to avoid any un-favourable parameter configurations. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nCommunity discussion, whereby any service provider or contributor can elect to work with the author on the implementation. The main intent here is for Aave to make the most of the rewards distribution programs that are about to add to Stader Lab’s existing reward program.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if a risk service provider could confirm the above will not adversely affect users, which hopefully will resonate with delegates within the community.\n\nThe key with this proposal is time, as rewards on v3 will last only a finite amount of time. The author believes the changes presented here within, thought of as a one-off, or opportunistic, will lead to the migration of the majority of most liquidity. The liquidity mining campaign coordinated by Llama should be capitalized upon. \n\n# Disclosoure\n\nTokenLogic is publishing this proposal as the scope falls outside of Llama’s core role within the Aave ecosystem, that said, at TokenLogic we are more than happy for any contributor to progress this proposal. There are no payments to TokenLogic, direct or indirect, relating to this forum post. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Proposal\nWormhole is a leading cross-chain interoperability protocol, allowing generic messaging over 22 heterogenous blockchains 1 and soon to be many more.\n\nSince launch on mainnet in August 2021, 160 million messages have been transmitted with 2 million messages 1 currently generated a day between asset transfers and messaging. The sheer load of messages that Wormhole processes in a 24 hour period is comparable to an L1 and signals its high reliability.\n\nWormhole has nineteen guardians comprised of the leading PoS validators 1 who jointly attest to messages. Each guardian holds equal weight in governance and consensus. Wormhole requires over two-thirds of the 19 guardians to gain consensus and pass verification, thus we assume that at least one-third of our guardian set is trustworthy.\n\nHashflow is a decentralized exchange platform designed for interoperability, zero slippage, and MEV-protected trades. Hashflow works by connecting professional market makers directly to traders using a request-for-quote (RFQ) model.\n\nHashflow uses DeFi-native RFQs to fetch quotes from market makers who are responsible for managing liquidity in the pools. Market makers are required to cryptographically sign quotes that remain unchanged for the duration of the trade. This ensures that the price is guaranteed and cannot be front-run or sandwich attacked. It also protects traders against slippage if there is significant price movement between the time it takes to validate the transaction on the source chain and relay the payload on to the destination chain.\n\nHashflow leverages Wormhole’s generalized message-passing to communicate between source and destination chains.\n\nWe propose a custom protocol utilizing Wormhole’s generic messaging for cross-chain communication and Hashflow’s cross-chain DEX to facilitate collateral transfers when backing aTokens (detailed below). Generic messaging unlocks Wormhole as a neutral interoperability layer on which protocols can serve users across most chains today. Wormhole has been integrated with Hashflow, which leverages a request-for-quote (RFQ) model for efficient liquidity provision, depth, and order execution quality. Users request a quote to sell some amount of asset X on the source chain and buy some amount of asset Y on the target chain without incurring slippage on the quoted price. Institutional market makers compete on price and depth for order execution and provide a signed quote to the user, which the user includes as calldata when sending the trade transaction on the source chain. With over $11.75B in lifetime trading volume and aggregate average daily volume of $25M from traders directly using the platform and through the aggregators 1inch Network, Open Ocean, Odos, and Zerion, Hashflow has been battle-tested and is a logical starting choice for these cross-chain collateral transfers. Users pay no trading fees for this cross-chain swap but are responsible for the associated gas fees when bridging their aTokens and might incur an implicit fee in any price-differences between the collateral asset on the source and destination chain. Additionally, Wormhole currently does not charge any fees for token bridging.\n\nPending Aave V3 deployments on the specific L1s/L2s, the protocol can support Aave on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and BNB. To start, we suggest piloting Portals on Arbitrum as a burgeoning deployment and ecosystem.\n\n## Integration\nA custom protocol (”Protocol”) utilizing Wormhole and Hashflow for a Portals integration could function as follows for a given source and target chain:\n\nUser uses the Protocol front-end built on Wormhole to transfer aTokens to the Protocol contract.\n\nProtocol front-end will fetch a signed quote from Hashflow which will be used as a payload to perform the cross-chain swap\nProtocol front-end will allow the user to review the quote before confirming the transaction\nUser’s aTokens are then escrowed in the Protocol on the source chain.\nFollowing the transfer of aTokens, the source chain Protocol contract calls the withdraw function in the Aave Pool contract on the source chain, which transfers the user’s previously escrowed aTokens from the Protocol contract to the Aave Pool contract and then transfers the user’s underlying collateral from the Aave Pool contract to the Protocol contract.\n\nThe contract then submits the signed quote to Hashflow’s cross-chain router to swap the user’s source-chain native collateral to the target-chain native collateral, sending this collateral to the target chain Protocol contract.\n\nNext, the target chain Protocol contract calls mintUnbacked 2 function in the target chain Aave Pool contract followed by the backUnbacked function to atomically mint aTokens to the user on the target chain and back these aTokens.\n\nTo prevent the collateral risk to the Protocol on the source chain and to allow for seamless atomic liquidations on the target chain, we suggest that Aave prevent users from bridging aTokens used as collateral on the source chain and prevent the use of the unbacked aTokens as collateral on the target chain until they’ve been backed by the bridge.\n\n## Technical Specifications\nIs the entity a Bridge?\n\nWhile users can bridge assets using applications built atop Wormhole, Wormhole is primarily a generic interoperability protocol, enabling users and developers alike to use and build complex, composable applications on top of Wormhole.\nCan anyone provide liquidity to the protocol?\n\nN/A\nIs liquidity incentivized?\n\nNo, at this time liquidity is not incentivized.\nIs there a fee model for participants?\n\nThere are currently no fees when participants use Wormhole.\nDoes the entity plan to provide available liquidity into Aave protocol?\n\nTBD\nLink to analytics dashboard of protocol (Liquidity, assets, networks, volume).\n\nhttps://wormhole.com/stats/ 1\nhttps://wormhole.com/explorer/ 1\nhttps://app.hashflow.com/dashboard\nIf applicable, link to the user-focused dapp of the entity.\n\nhttps://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer\nhttps://wormhole.com/ecosystem/\nhttps://app.hashflow.com/ 1\nLink to technical documentation\n\nhttps://book.wormhole.com/\nhttps://docs.hashflow.com/hashflow/product/bridgeless-cross-chain-swaps\nProposed Portals Asset Minting Caps\nOn all networks that Aave V3 is deployed on and Wormhole supports, we propose conservative Portals minting caps of $0.5M, $1M, and 50 ETH respectively for USDC, USDT, and ETH to begin with but aim to increase this over time subject to governance. The protocol will charge users a nominal 3bps fee to bridge over their aTokens, of which the Aave DAO will be entitled to 50%.\n\nScreenshot 2023-02-22 at 3.27.46 PM\nScreenshot 2023-02-22 at 3.27.46 PM\n1436×168 6.53 KB\nBenefits to AaveDAO\nAave is at an inflection point, with a sizable but closing head-start on its multi-chain deployment and usage. With the launch of V3 on Ethereum, it is timely to pilot Portals, enabling seamless flows of capital from the liquidity hub of Ethereum to the other V3 deployments. For AaveDao’s longterm success, it’s imperative that the DAO fosters these multi-chain deployments while still in the lead as the tight integration of aToken assets into DeFi creates a strong moat. Additionally, with tens to hundreds of millions of TVL and volume in Hashflow and Wormhole, we see Portals as an natural way to onboard Hashflow and Wormhole users into the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Audits & Security\nList of relevant security audits of the Wormhole network\n\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Ethereum Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Solana Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Terra Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Guardian\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Solitaire\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Ethereum Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Solana Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Terra Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Guardian\nAugust 2022 - Kudelski: Algorand Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - OtterSec: NEAR Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - Trail of Bits: Solana Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - Trail of Bits: CosmWasm Contracts\nUnderway audits can be found here\nList of relevant security audits of Hashflow\n\nOctober 2022 - Quantstamp\nOctober 2022 - Certik\nNovember 2022 - OpenZeppelin\nSecurity Properties\n\nThe Wormhole dependency in the implementation above is in the core messaging layer, relying on the standard trust assumption of the PoA consensus with 19 guardians where more than two-thirds are required to reach consensus and verify a message. These guardians are made up of some of the largest and most reputable staking providers in crypto. This level of operational security diversity is a useful property in preventing wholesale compromise of the Guardian Set due to operational failures of a single or small number of organizations. More information on Wormhole security practices can be found here.\n\nHashflow relies on Market Makers for providing quotes, and Wormhole for ensuring that the cross-chain messages are correctly passed. The former is a transparent process (the user can see these quotes ahead of execution), whereas the latter falls back on Wormhole’s security properties.\n\nThe logic of creating new unbacked aTokens on the target chain, withdrawing collateral on behalf of the user on the source chain, and backing users’ unbacked aTokens on the target chain lies in the Aave protocol, falling back on Aave’s security.\n\nHas the Entity experienced outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks? On which Networks?\n\nWe recognize that Wormhole has earned some press for the hack in February of this year. Since then, Wormhole continues to add multiple security layers 1 to help prevent/mitigate the effects of smart contract bugs like the one responsible for that hack:\nThe first of these, Governor, allows each Guardian to set limits on the notional value of any transfer originating on a supported chain within a specified time period. The Governor allows Wormhole Guardians to provide optional value movement protections to token bridges built on Wormhole. This protection allows Wormhole Guardians to govern (or effectively rate-limit) the notional flow of assets from any given token bridge chain. This safety feature allows Guardians to limit the impact of any security issue any given chain may have from affecting other connected chains. The Governor allows the setting of daily limits of notional flow and also has an ability to set a fixed finality delay for transactions over a specific size for each supported chain.\n\nFurther layers of security to prevent incorrect withdrawals of funds is the Cosmos-based Wormhole Chain, which enables Guardians to independently verify if the source chain has sufficient funds to do cross-chain transfers, and an emergency shutdown module, allowing a quorum of Guardians to temporarily pause value movement through Wormhole.\n\nAdditionally, Wormhole has a $2.5M bounty program on Immunefi.",

        "body": "## Summary\nChaos Labs proposes to expand the scope of its engagement with Aave to include proactive risk analysis and management of the v2 markets while encouraging and supporting a safe migration to the upcoming Ethereum v3 deployment.\n\nThe current engagement is focused on providing risk analyses and parameter recommendations across only v3 markets ([Discussion link](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025)). With the recent volatility in the markets and attempted exploit through the CRV pool, our resources have shifted to supporting Aave v2 on Ethereum, as well, to ensure protocol stability and security.\n\nWe wanted to put this a community vote and formalize coverage and expectations around Chaos’ work on this instance and support during the launch and transition towards v3 on relevant protocols.\n\n## Background\nChaos Labs was approved as a risk partner for Aave v3 earlier last month and have begun work to launch the [Community Parameter Recommendations](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025/19)  in the coming weeks covering all relevant v3 markets across LTV, Liquidation Threshold, Liquidation Bonus, and Supply/Borrow Caps with other metrics coming shortly thereafter.\n\nAs liquidity in DeFi has dried up and volatility in non-pegged assets has increased, the risk situation for Aave v2 has become a greater concern to the community, with more surface area to be covered. It was not our intention to cover v2 during this engagement, as we were heads down and focused on v3. As the market volatility picked up, Chaos was asked (both publicly and privately) for our analysis of the state of the protocol to support and help minimize the risk of additional bad debt accrued to the protocol. Through the forum discussions around the appropriate risk response to the existing market factors, we aligned with the community that not all markets needed to be frozen, and there was a path forward with mitigated parameters, which we stepped in to propose in order to allow the community to have a voice both in the forums and via governance votes. All have passed with a significant show of support.\n\nWe are still iterating and publishing the amended parameters for v2 in line with those early proposals and have begun discussions analyzing the most appropriate path to transition usage to v3.\n\nThrough our first month as a contributor, we have coordinated with other DAO contributors to submit several risk proposals, including:\n\n- [v3 Supply Cap Recommendations for Uncapped Assets (Fast-track)](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf40a7b4a6ecd5325553593f0f9fdc8ba04808573fdf76fc277aee52b5396a588)\n- [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool (AIP 125)](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=125)\n- [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LT and LTV (2022.12.01)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897)\n- [V3 Borrow Cap Recommendations (Fast-track) (2022-12-05)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-borrow-cap-recommendations-fast-track-2022-12-05/10927)\n- [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LTs and LTVs for Long Tail Assets (2022.12.04)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lts-and-ltvs-for-long-tail-assets-2022-12-04/10926)\n\nAdditionally, we have published research on a number of topics to help inform community discussion:\n\n- [v2 Liquidation Threshold impact analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-recommendations-for-aave-v2-eth-2022-11-22/10757/30)\n- [BTC vs. WBTC Oracle Analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/wbtcs-and-others-pricing-mechanism-on-aave/10825/6)\n- [Chaos Labs Asset Protection Tool](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-asset-protection-tool)\n\nAave v2 is the only instance of the protocol live on Ethereum mainnet today, while the development for v3 to launch is ongoing. Usage capabilities of Aave v2 have been curtailed significantly, first by freezing several assets and subsequently unfreezing a portion of them to allow for supplying of “risky assets” and enabling borrows for well-structured “pegged assets.”\n\nThe transition to Aave v3 on mainnet will not be entirely seamless and will require the support of all contributors and community members to ensure it goes as smoothly as possible.\n\n## Proposal\n#### Scope\n\nBased on the work done to date in a short time frame and the amount of work ahead to transition from v2 to v3 on Ethereum, Chaos Labs is proposing to extend the scope of the original engagement to support parameter optimization on v2 as well as conduct relevant risk analyses during the transition planning.\n\nOur priority with this added scope would be to methodically update parameters, protect existing user funds, and mitigate new potential risk factors on v2 while ensuring the capital efficiency of v3 is a more attractive option for new users.\n\nThis includes topics and considerations such as:\n\nMethodically amending asset parameters to incentivize new users to open accounts on v3\nInitiating coordination with third-party protocols building on top of v2 to assist in transition planning, communications, and timing\nHelping analyze incentive (both treasury- and parameter-managed) schemes to incite account transitions\nContinued analysis of the impact of market events and risk scenarios for the DAO\nThis work will be in conjunction with our existing v3 responsibilities and should not materially impact timelines for delivery during the coming months.\n\n### Duration: \nWe propose this engagement to align with the 6-month anniversary of our original engagement, thus covering the remaining 5-month period. The intent is to bridge the transition from v2 to v3 during this period with a finite end date and not continue on indefinitely. If there is still material TVL on v2 at the end of this period, we will discuss the appropriate next steps and maintenance/monitoring expectations with the community.\n\n### Compensation: \n$250k streamed linearly over the 5-month period (equating to $50k per month).\n- 30% ($75k) payable in AAVE tokens\n- 70% ($175k) in stablecoins",

Loans are interest-free, with a 0.5% base initiation fee. All the contracts of the Liquity protocol are immutable, which makes LUSD the most trustless stablecoin currently available on the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nLUSD is overcollateralized by ETH with two main mechanisms helping it keep its peg: first, LUSD can be redeemed for ETH at face value (i.e., 1 LUSD for $1 of ETH). Secondly, there is a minimal collateral ratio of 110%. Both mechanisms respectively create a price floor and ceiling through arbitrage opportunities.\n\nSince the protocol is immutable, no additional developments are planned, yet the Liquity team is working on another project that will prove synergetic with LUSD.\n\nLUSD’s resilience makes it a highly sought-after stablecoin for DAOs and protocols looking to diversify their treasury and users looking for cost-effective leverage on ETH. The current focus is to grow the DeFi ecosystem around LUSD to enable more diverse use cases.\n\nThis proposal aims to add LUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave v2 mainnet (0% LTV). If the current proposal is met with enthusiasm, other proposals will follow suit.\n\n### Specifications\n\n#### AIP author status\n\nI, TokenBrice, author of this ARC [recently joined](https://tokenbrice.xyz/joining-liquity/) the Liquity team to help with DeFi strategy.\n\n#### Overview of the project and token\n\nLiquity is a protocol offering cost-efficient leverage using ETH as collateral. While its base design can be described as similar to Maker/DAI, there are several key differences:\n\n* Only ETH is accepted as collateral to maximize the protocol's trustlessness and resilience.\n* There is no interest fee on Liquity. Instead, the borrowers pay a predictable initiation fee starting at 0,5% — and ramping up algorithmically when needed to protect the protocol.\n* Liquidations are close to instant, and enabled by a protocol-level backstop: [the stability pool](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations), a reserve of LUSD deposited by users.\n* Just like Aave, Liquity uses ChainLink as the main price feed. However there is a [fallback system](https://docs.liquity.org/faq/stability-pool-and-liquidations) in place, switching to Tellor, if the ChainLink price feed data is deemed incoherent.\n* Since the contracts are immutable, there is no governance. There is still a token associated with the protocol – [LQTY](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6dea81c8171d0ba574754ef6f8b412f2ed88c54d), but it’s used for incentivization and fee-sharing purposes only.\n* The minimal required collateralization ratio is lower – at 110%, increasing the capital efficiency of the protocol. This is possible thanks to the stability pool and instant liquidation mechanism which also helps maintain the peg by acting as a liquidity buffer. A failsafe mechanism, called the Recovery Mode, is triggered when the total collateralization ratio of the protocol falls below 150%. Being an exceptional measure, the Recovery Mode enforces more substantial restrictions on the Troves, such as temporary minimal collateralization of 150%, until the total collateralization ratio of the protocol recovers. So far, it was only triggered once in the early days of the protocol.\n\n#### Positioning within Aave Ecosystem\n\nLUSD is a stablecoin offering some genuinely unique features, the leading one being the trustlessness of the whole Liquity protocol. In that sense, LUSD is one of the most resilient stablecoin and the most decentralized. Similar to the addition of RAI on Aave, having LUSD will help Aave diversify from the current dominance of centralized stablecoins such as USDC used for borrowing.\n\nFurthermore, as mentioned above, this proposal is the first step. Several others could follow to nurture the relationship between Aave and Liquity further:\n\n1. Enablement of LUSD as collateral (LTV>0%)\n2. Enablement of efficiency mode against selected stablecoins once v3 mainnet is live.\n3. Addition of LUSD on Aave/Optimism + potential enablement as collateral + again enablement of the efficiency mode.\n\nI believe that LUSD as a borrowable asset will be met with a strong demand: it will be the first time such a resilient stablecoin could be borrowed on Aave and the first protocol where LUSD is borrowable.\n\n#### History of the project and its components\n\nThe Liquity protocol was launched on the 5th of April, 2021. As the code is immutable, there has been no update since then. However, the team is still actively working on the protocol' DeFi integrations, such as supporting LUSD liquidity on Curve.\n\nSince the demand for LUSD is directly dependent on the appetite for leverage on ETH, the LUSD supply had varied quite a bit since the launch, with the highest point around 1.5B LUSD when ETH reached a peak price of ~$4K. The following correction on ETH, with the lowest point around $2K, led to a drastic reduction in the LUSD supply – this episode is the first and so far unique time when the Recovery Mode was triggered. Since this episode, the supply has stabilized more and is now around 325M LUSD. This episode was the first massive stress test for the Liquity Protocol, which handled it gracefully – a recap is available here:\n\nhttps://www.liquity.org/blog/how-liquity-handled-its-first-big-stress-test\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiezquc6y7pkordcigvzwfwhgjfagnilxeweeuawycupuq6gsb3jxa)\n    \n\n\nSince the protocol launch, various DeFi integrations have been built on top of the Liquity Protocol, here are some of the most notable:\n\n* A Curve pool (+integration on Convex and Yearn) was created against the 3Pool and became the main liquidity source. It’s amongst the stablecoin pools with the highest base APR due to the trading volume it processes.\n* DeFiSaver offers some automation features to streamline Troves management.\n* B.Protocol delivered an auto-compounder for depositors of the Stability Pool who wish to keep a 100% LUSD exposure: https://app.bprotocol.org/liquity\n* Some protocols, such as Olympus or Fei Protocol diversified part of their treasury to LUSD to shield themselves from volatility with an unstoppable stablecoin. Synthetix is also using LUSD on Optimism to stabilize the sUSD price.\n\n#### LUSD usage\n\nA sizeable share of the LUSD supply (~66%) is deposited into the Stability Pool, the liquidity backstop for liquidations: https://etherscan.io/address/0x66017d22b0f8556afdd19fc67041899eb65a21bb\n\nThe top LUSD holders also include other protocols, such as Olympus, DXdao or some treasuries.\n\nLUSD is also present on Optimism, where Synthetix provided a wrapper contract to help stabilize the sUSD price (~45M LUSD) + to provide liquidity on Velodrome (the pool is ~9M TVL, against USDC).\n\n#### LUSD Emission\n\nThe only way to mint LUSD is to open a Trove, while LUSD is burned through debt repayment, either directly (by the trove owner) or through redemptions (by an arbitrageur).\n\n#### Token & Protocol Permissions\n\nThe LUSD token as well as the whole Liquity protocol are fully permissionless. There is no multisig and no governance, and no-one can interact with the contract underlying the protocol in an administrative manner: all users are the same in front of the contract, just like with Uniswap v2 for instance.\n\n#### Market Data\n\nAs of June 03, the total LUSD supply is around 325M. There is about $90M of total liquidity in pools where LUSD is involved.\n\nThe main liquidity source for LUSD is the Curve pool with ~$65M TVL: https://curve.fi/lusd\n\nThere are also liquidity sources against FRAX, USDC and DAI on Uniswap V3: https://info.uniswap.org/#/tokens/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0\n\nThere is a 4-tokens pool on Saddle Finance (alUSD, FEI, FRAX, LUSD) with $25M liquidity: https://saddle.exchange/#/pools/D4/deposit\n\nFinally, on Optimism, LUSD is the largest stablecoin pool with around ~$9M against USDC https://app.velodrome.finance/liquidity/0x207addb05c548f262219f6bfc6e11c02d0f7fdbe\n\nThe observed volume can vary depending on the market's activity (massive ETH price movements are usually followed by days with large volume), with a baseline around $3M daily volume (mainnet only).\n\n#### Social channel data\n\nThe main channel for the community to gather is the Liquity Discord server, with around 6.5K members. For outward-facing communications, the main channel used is the @LiquityProtocol Twitter account with over 28.5K followers. We also regularly publish newsletter updates to subscribers (2.5K) and have recently become more active on LinkedIn (<1K).\n\n#### Contract Related Information\n\nDeployment of the LUSD contract - 05 April 2021: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x85cc9a6626ed080c909f768036c80bd02455c5dbd32a03aa1f16ba9575227599\n\nThe first minting of LUSD - 05 April 2021: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4db907b5377b14ad5849f7bd4fa2ecb52c1ce07757df8887cf4df3394d01842d\n\nNumber of transactions on LUSD: 197,461 (+ ~2000 on Optimism)\n\nNumber of token holders on LUSD: 4758 (+ ~100 on Optimism)\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nWe followed [Aave's risk assessment methodology](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/methodology) to provide all the necessary metrics:\n\nI'm not sure what the proper rating is for a stablecoin with no governance and immutable code should be when it comes to the \"Permission\" category, so I went with an A to reflect that in that regard, LUSD is almost as safe as ETH. Feel free to challenge me if you think that is not appropriate.\n\n(Volume data from [CoinGecko](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/liquity-usd/market_chart?vs_currency=usd&days=max))\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihyr62jyjgdkitekoenr4pz6yqltebmnafcwgzf7y7b2jux7cgvga)\n    \n\n#### Smart Contract Risk\nMaturity|Transaction\n:--|:--\n | \n429|197990\nB+|C+\n\n#### Counterparty Risks\n\nHolders|Permission\n:--|:--\n | \n4763|Permissionless and Immutable\nC|A\n\n#### Market Risk\n\nMarket Cap|Average Volume| |Normalized Volatility| | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n.|1M|3M|1M|3M|6M\n337989637|12244118.23|7406951.186|0.002836979528|0.002166153429|0.004069270527\nB|C|C|A+|A+|A+",
