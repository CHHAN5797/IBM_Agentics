        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/519\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? No\n> 3. **Audits:** [Audits](https://docs.overnight.fi/advanced/audits)\n> * [Hacken Audit (Feb 3, 2022) - App](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-app/blob/master/audits/hacken_2022-02-03.pdf)\n> * [Hacken Audit (Feb 3, 2022) - Core](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-core/blob/master/audits/hacken_2022-02-03.pdf)\n> * [Ackee Audit (Mar 3, 2023)](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-core/blob/master/audits/ackee_2023-03-03.pdf)\n>\n> 4. **Market History:**\n> Overnight Pulse on Beethoven [Beethoven X | Overnight Pulse ](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0xb1c9ac57594e9b1ec0f3787d9f6744ef4cb0a02400000000000000000000006e)\n> Overnight Pulse on Balancer Arbitrum [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x519cce718fcd11ac09194cff4517f12d263be067000000000000000000000382)\n>\n> 5. **Value:** The pool is expected to generate trading volumes and fees for Balancer.The proposed OVN/wUSD+ pool aims to be a primary source of liquidity for both tokens, enhancing the stability and depth of the market on Balancer.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/521\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis proposal enables a Gyroscope gauge for a R/sDAI Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP) on Ethereum Mainnet. The pool will be seeded with liquidity in the 0.9 - 1.001 range and two other pools with liquidity in the 0.95 - 1.001 and 0.98 - 1.001 range will follow soon. By deploying these new pools, users will be able to trade between R and sDAI at extremely low price impact in the 0.9 - 1.001 R/sDAI range. The deployment of this pool builds upon the release of the Peg Stability Module (PSM), aimed at stabilizing the R peg and providing a source of yield for R Savings Module depositors through the accumulation of sDAI.\n\n**Protocol description**\n\nRaft is a DeFi protocol that lets you generate $R, a leading decentralized USD stablecoin, by opening a CDP (collateralized debt position), or by depositing stablecoins into the Raft protocol reserve.R is backed by high quality collateral assets such as[ stETH](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth) (Lido Staked Ether) and[ rETH](https://stake.rocketpool.net/) (Rocket Pool ETH) and reserve assets such as[ CHAI](https://chai.money/), the yield-bearing version of the DAI stablecoin. R aims to be the stablecoin of choice within the decentralized ecosystem, with deep liquidity across many trading pairs, a high yield, and a stable peg. As more use cases for $R develop, users will be able to spend, swap, and earn with $R. Users will also be able to leverage up to 6x on different LSD tokens in a single atomic transaction.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe R/sDAI pool on Gyroscope is a natural progression from the PSM, offering swaps from R to sDAI with the best price impact conditions compared to other uniform liquidity pools. The pool will receive incentives that will be distributed based on the PSM's ongoing usage and the development of the R peg over time. Liquidity providers in such pool will benefit from earning the DAI Savings Rate and from being depositors in the most capital efficient pool where to trade R.\n\nThe pool will have 5 bps swap fees, an amplification coefficient of 700 and a 10 bps upper price bound that enables the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n1. Governance: The Raft governance model focuses on being efficient, transparent, and community-driven, while maintaining a governance-minimized approach. The governance model will be strengthened further by the launch of a native token that confers governance power to its holders.\n\n2. Oracles: The pools rely on price feeds from Chainlink and Tellor\n\n3. Audits: Raft is audited by Trail of Bits and Hats Finance\n\n4. Market History: Raft was launched on June 5th 2023 and has attracted approx $65m TVL at its peak. The Raft team has worked with the Balancer community to launch two successful pools (see $R here, the R/DAI pool on Balancer[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x20a61b948e33879ce7f23e535cc7baa3bc66c5a9000000000000000000000555) and R/wstETH pool[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x380aabe019ed2a9c2d632b51eddd30fd804d0fad0002000000000000000005547c47f942beea)) . We would like to continue working within the Balancer ecosystem going forward.\n\n5. Value: The R/DAI pool deployed on Balancer has been among the top 5 pools on Balancer by trading volume in the last few weeks, exceeding $ 1 mln daily trading volume. We expect the R/sDAI pool on Gyroscope to generate a consistent amount of volume due to the capital efficiency embedded in the concentrated liquidity model and in the choice of pairing R with a yield-bearing asset like sDAI\n\n**Centralization vectors**\n\n1. Liquidations are permissionless (anybody can liquidate)\n2. The key parts of the Raft protocol are immutable\n3. The Liquidity Committee includes 3 Raft team members. More to be added in the future as the Raft governance evolves\n\n\n**References / useful links**\n\n· Website: [https://raft.fi/ ](https://raft.fi/)\n\n· Documentation: https://docs.raft.fi/\n\n· Twitter: https://twitter.com/raft_fi\n\n· Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/raft-fi)\n\n· GitHub: [Raft · GitHub](https://github.com/raft-fi/) \n\n**Audits**\n\nRaft’s smart contracts have been audited twice:\n\n1.

Its main product offerings, tAssets and the Decentralized Offered Rate (DOR), were developed to address a critical gap in the fixed income digital assets market and set a standard for decentralized reference rates.\n\ntETH, the first tAsset deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, is a liquid staking token (LST) that converges the fragmented on-chain ETH interest rates market. Holders of tETH earn real yield exceeding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage across various lending and borrowing protocols, all while retaining the ability to use tETH for other DeFi activities.\n\nSince its launch, the tETH vault has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140 million worth of ETH within just a month and a half.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nTreehouse Protocol is working to establish the tETH-wstETH Gauge on Balancer to enhance the liquidity of tETH. Increased liquidity facilitates smoother entry and exit for traders and investors, which is essential for the overall usability and appeal of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) within the DeFi ecosystem. This liquidity boost not only supports market efficiency but also attracts more participants to the Balancer ecosystem, where the tETH-wstETH pool will generate yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** All ownable contracts are secured with a 5/7 multi-sig. Only the tETH contract is upgradable for future expansion plans.\n\n2. **Oracles:** [tETH-wstETH rate provider](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c53f86d9a6b01821f916802a7606e9255dfe4e2) is based on wstETH as a base asset, it is not compatible with any pools aside from a wstETH pairing for the intended use of a rate provider.\n\n4. **Audits:** Treehouse Protocol has been audited by entities such as Fuzzland, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits and the reports can be seen in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n5. **Centralization vectors:** The centralization vector primarily involves the execution of actions in the strategy contract which are done by a multi-sig appointed by the contract owner. However, all action contracts are well-defined and the executors can only perform the whitelisted actions included in the strategy contract.\n\n6. **Market History:** tETH has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140M worth of ETH since its launch on 10th September 2024. The tETH-wstETH Balancer pool has been in inception since 23 October 2024. More information about tETH and the Treehouse Protocol ecosystem can be found on the [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/treehouseprotocol/treehousefi).\n-[tETH-wstETH pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x1d13531bf6344c102280ce4c458781fbf14dad140000000000000000000006df)\n-[tETH-wstETH pool gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862)\n \n8. **Value:** The tETH-wstETH pool on Balancer is designed to be a key source of liquidity for the token on the Ethereum network. By pairing tETH with wstETH, the pool aims to provide a seamless trading experience while also offering enhanced rewards for liquidity providers. This structure is intended to optimize both liquidity and profitability within the ecosystem. In addition, users who stake their tETH-wstETH LP tokens will be able to earn points from our current ongoing points program.\n\n**Transaction Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n* The pool shall has a swap fee of 4 basis points, i.e., 0.04% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n# References/Useful links\n\n* [Slidedeck on E-CLPs ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n* [Website ](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github ](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> pxETH is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol. pxETH is built on top of the Redacted DAO’s Pirex platform and forms an integral part of Redacted’s Dinero protocol, a protocol which aims to vertically integrate ETH staking, block proposal and building, a RPC, leverage, and yield stripping into one synergistic ecosystem comprising pxETH, the Redacted Relayer RPC, and the DINERO stablecoin. pxETH provides users with a liquid and fungible tokenized staked ETH which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here ](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Redacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\nBy using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\n* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\nSeveral E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: [https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps) 1\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n## Oracles\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n## Audits\n\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n## Centralization vectors\n\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n## Market History\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available[ here 1 ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n\n## Value\n\nAs per “Motivation”.\n\n## Contracts\n\n* [pxETH/WETH E-CLP ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x048158D7c77518Bd72fDbE22D68719a9AAeC75e0)\n* Ethereum [gauge ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x924ABE88022F9422a2938aE0741Fc2C769E85934)\n[Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x048158d7c77518bd72fdbe22d68719a9aaec75e0000200000000000000000688)\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x924ABE88022F9422a2938aE0741Fc2C769E85934`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/613\n\n**Summary:**\n\nDavos Protocol aims to establish to further its presence in both the Balancer and Ethereum ecosystems by introducing a gauge for the new sDAI/DUSD LP. This strategic move is intended to position the pool as the primary liquidity source for DUSD on Ethereum, while simultaneously boosting DUSD liquidity on Balancer. By channeling resources towards this specific pool, Davos Protocol aims to enhance liquidity and promote a vibrant ecosystem for both DUSD and within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\nLink to:\n• Website: https://davos.xyz/\n• Documentation: https://davos.xyz/docs/\n• Github Page: https://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts\n• Communities: https://twitter.com/Davos_Protocol\n• Other useful links: https://davos.xyz/assets/davos_whitepaper.pdf\n\n**Protocol Description:**\nDavos Protocol is a decentralized on-chain stablecoin protocol operating on various networks due to the omnichain capability of DUSD and is governed by the Davos Governance Token (DGT). It enables users to optimize the value of their crypto assets by accessing loans in DUSD stablecoin and earning competitive interest rates. The protocol prioritizes Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) as collateral and other reward-bearing tokens. Through collateralized reward-bearing assets, particularly LSTs, users can compound their yields and benefit from DeFi composability. The protocol redistributes DUSD yield and incentives to stakers, lenders, and liquidity providers, amplifying the benefits and utility of reward-bearing tokens within the ecosystem. Community-driven governance by DGT token holders plays a vital role in decision-making and voting.\n\n**Motivation:**\nDavos Protocol redistributes the revenues generated from the interest rate imposed by the protocol when depositing collateral and minting the stablecoin DUSD, commonly referred to as “bribes,” to the DEX pool. To streamline this process and improve efficiency, the protocol proposes for a gauge to be in place that enables direct distribution of these incentives. As the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the pool increases, the pool receives a larger portion of incentives from Davos Protocol. This incentivizes the pool to become the primary liquidity source for the DUSD omnichain stablecoin.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\nGovernance of the Davos Protocol is facilitated through DGT, granting holders the power to vote on protocol changes. DGT holders can propose and vote on modifications, ensuring democratic decision-making. Changes approved by the voters won’t take effect immediately, safeguarding the system against potentially harmful proposals. The Global Davos Council (GDC) is a council consisting of co-founders and advisors. The GDC serves as a governing body, providing guidance and expertise.\n2. **Oracles:**\nAs of now, the protocol does not rely on or utilize any oracles.\n3. **Audits:**\nhttps://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/blob/main/audits/Quantstamp_130223.pdf\nhttps://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/blob/main/audits/Veridise_301122.pdf\nhttps://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/blob/main/audits/SlowMist_310523.pdf\nhttps://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/blob/main/audits/Veridise_280623.pdf\n4. **Centralization vectors:**\nDUSD operates as a decentralized stablecoin and the protocol is currently managed by the core team, but the Governance Token (DGT) and veDGT model will be released to enable community governance. Liquidation can be performed by any individual.\n5. **Market History:**\n[Davos.xyz USD price today, DUSD to USD live price, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/davos-protocol/)\n6. **Value:**\nThe pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token.\n\nLink to Pool: https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x35c5c8c7b77942f9d44b535fa590d8b503b2b00c00000000000000000000060d\nLink to Gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x08e179Cf6F2Ca5dff67E93CdfBE2a29B2d8A27F7\n\nSpecification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x08e179Cf6F2Ca5dff67E93CdfBE2a29B2d8A27F7`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\nAdditionally, this pool is requesting `core pool` status as per BIP-457",
