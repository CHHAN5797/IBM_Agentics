        "body": "Following the completion of the allocations made in STEP 1, in February 2025 the Arbitrum DAO passed a proposal for the diversification of an additional 35 million ARB into stable, liquid, and yield bearing assets with the [STEP 2 proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13323456481927947871314500108227684550647495448005726995657704713229313956489?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4).\n\nWe thank all applicants for their submissions and thoughtful participation in the process. The candidate pool was extremely robust, with over 50 applications including those from STEP 1.\n\nThe total value of the allocated ARB, still awaiting diversification, is currently ~$10.66M as of April 20th, 2025. The committee appointed to examine applications has come out with its preference for allocation and Entropy has been tasked to post on the committee’s behalf. After review of each application, the final recommendations are as follows (denominated as a percentage of the total budget);\n\n[WisdomTree WTGXX](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wisdomtree-wtgxx-step-application/28756): 30%\n\n[Spiko USTBL](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-2-application-spiko-ustbl/28752): 35%\n\n[Franklin Templeton FOBXX (BENJI)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/franklin-onchain-u-s-government-money-fund-fobxx-step-application/23655): 35%\n\nApplicants who are not selected will have an opportunity to reapply in the next round and are welcome to message a committee member for private feedback. As a part of the evaluation in STEP 2, the committee reevaluated the commitments made in STEP 1 with some thoughts and requests relayed privately to the issuers of the tokens.\n\nThe committee is happy to field any questions under this forum post or privately and plans to take this proposal to Snapshot for final ratification on Thursday, May 1st.\n\n**Disclaimer** *The information provided in this proposal is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.

        "body": "# TL;DR\nThe GMC's preferred choices for the deployment of 7,500 Arbitrum DAO treasury ETH are stated below. The selected protocols include Camelot, Aave, Lido, and Fluid. If this vote receives 3% of the votable token supply in favor (or abstain) of deploying assets in accordance to the GMC's choices, the Arbitrum Foundation will begin to mobilize. \n\n# Summary [Updated on March 14, 2025]\nOn December 21 2024, the Arbitrum DAO voted in favour of establishing two committees - the Treasury Management Committee (TMC) and the Growth Management Committee (GMC), who were tasked with spearheading treasury management efforts involving 25M ARB and 7,500 ETH, respectively, within the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury.\n\nThis proposal presents GMC’s preferred allocation choices with accompanying risk assessments performed by LlamaRisk. After assessing all 45 applications, the GMC is proposing to allocate 5,000 ETH to Lido to be staked for wstETH, and deposit this 5,000 wstETH into Aave V3 on Arbitrum to act as liquidity for LST/LRT looping, and lastly, lend 2,500 ETH on Fluid to support ETH based DEX and lending liquidity.\n\n# Objectives\nAs highlighted in the original Treasury Management V1.2 proposal, the purpose of the Growth Management Committee (GMC) was to provide a path for the Arbitrum Foundation to deploy 7,500 ETH from the DAO’s treasury to achieve 2 things:\n\nGenerate low-risk yield on otherwise idle ETH\nSpur ecosystem growth\nMoreover, given this is the DAO’s first tranche of funds, we really wanted to ensure the DAO starts with a really strong and stable foundation, while securing key partnerships from the very beginning. Thus, we focused on selecting extremely high quality partners with low risk strategies that allowed the DAO’s funds to maximize its reach and impact within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# GMC’s Preferred Allocations\nTotal Allocation: 7,500 ETH\n\nNumber of Allocations: 4\n\n# Allocation 1:\n\nProtocol: Lido\n\nAllocation Amount: 5,000 ETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Deposit and stake 5,000 ETH with Lido to receive wstETH\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n3.20% ETH/stETH yield (30D Avg.)\nHighly liquid & composable receipt token that can be extended across other applications (wstETH)\n20% “Reward Share” from Lido’s Reward-Share Program, effectively giving the DAO a higher yield on our ETH deposits into Lido\n# Allocation 2:\n\nProtocol: Aave\n\nAllocation Amount: 4,200 stETH (in wstETH) [Previously 5,000 ETH]\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Supply 4,200 stETH (in wstETH) to Aave V3 on Arbitrum to encourage LRT borrowing against wstETH in collaboration with Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n3.20% ETH/stETH yield (30D Avg.) + est. Aave wstETH supply yield of 0.62% + 0.82% in wstETH deposit incentives\nAdditional incentive programs from Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp, to drive wstETH, ezETH, and rsETH deposits to Aave V3 and more generally Arbitrum. This should also hopefully increase supply rates for wstETH on Aave\nAllows the DAO to repurpose funds from Allocation 1 (wstETH) to further improve the DeFi ecosystem while accessing a higher yield\nFurther Details Regarding Incentives:\n\nIn cooperation with Lido, an incentive program to grow wstETH deposits on the Aave Arbitrum instance has been designed.\n\nThe incentive program consists of three 30-day phases, each with increasing targets and budgets to encourage sustained growth in wstETH deposits on Aave. After 90 days this program will be reassessed and may be renewed. For each phase, the reward mechanism operates in two modes:\n\nWhen deposits are below the target: Depositors earn a fixed 0.82% APY.\nWhen deposits exceed the target: The daily reward amount is distributed pro-rata among all depositors.\nThe program features a 15% Month-over-Month growth target with an expanding budget to support continued growth in wstETH deposits on the Arbitrum Aave instance.\n\nPeriod (Days)\tBudget (wstETH)\tFixed APY\tDeposit Target\tDaily Reward\n0-30\t36.23\t0.82%\t53,014.48\t1.191\n31-60\t41.66\t0.82%\t60,956.66\t1.389\n61-90\t47.91\t0.82%\t70,111.66\t1.597\nRenzo\n\nRenzo is to provide 0.30% yield in REZ to users who deposit ezETH distributed every 30 days , provided certain conditions are upheld.\n\nKelp\n\nKelp is to provide x2 KERNEL points to users who deposit rsETH. These rewards will be claimable during Kernel’s TGE. Whilst the point yield is speculative, it does provide an alternative to Renzo’s governance token derived yield.\n\nIncentives\n\nThis strategy benefits directly from the Lido wstETH deposit incentives, and will indirectly benefit from the Renzo and Kelp deposit incentives.\n\nReward Type\tValue\tRewards to who\tBenefits treasury funds?\nwstETH Deposit Rewards\t0.82% APY\twstETH depositors\tDirectly\nKERNEL Points\tx2 Points\trsETH depositors\tIndirectly\nREZ Tokens\t0.3% APY\tezETH despositors\tIndirectly\nExpected Returns\n\nBased upon our modelling of the effects of the upcoming incentive programs and some minor Aave parameter adjustments which are planned, we expect wstETH deposits to generate the following returns:\n\nSource\tYield (APY)\nLido staking rewards\t3.10%\nAave protocol yield\t0.62%\nwstETH deposit incentives\t0.82%\nTotal yield\t4.54%\n# Allocation 3:\n\nProtocol: Fluid\n\nAllocation Amount: 2,500 ETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Lend 2,500 ETH on Fluid’s Arbitrum platform\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n1%-2% native ETH yield\nSupport the growth of Fluid’s highly capital efficient DEX and lending protocol by providing ‘sticky’ ETH liquidity for users to borrow\nDue to Fluid’s design, every $1 of ETH we lend, the Arbitrum ecosystem can benefit from up to $39 in liquidity\nProvide necessary liquidity to increase caps and onboard more LSTs and LRTs to Fluid’s Arbitrum instance\n# [Added as of March 14, 2025] Allocation 4:\n\nProtocol: Camelot - Updated submission can be found here\n\nAllocation Amount: 800 stETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Deposit 800 stETH (as wstETH) as single sided liquidity into the wstETH/ETH liquidity pool on Camelot V3.\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\nEarn 2.56% APY from wstETH yield, trading fees, & xGRAIL (30D Avg.)\nAllows the DAO to repurpose funds from Allocation 1 (wstETH) to further improve sticky DeFi liquidity\nA risk Assessment (LlamaRisk) finds that risks include liquidity concentration risk and smart contract risk.\n\nNote: The decision to provide single-sided wstETH liquidity came from discussions with and detailed analysis by the Camelot team, as they are aware of the difficulties associated with the DAO and the Arbitrum Foundation actively managing a concentrated LP position. Nonetheless, the strategy still successfully improves wstETH liquidity on Camelot and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\n# Justification\nThe GMC was impressed by the quality of inbound applications from protocols across many different verticals (full list can be in a subsequent section of this post). While the GMC wanted to venture further down the risk curve in order to increase yield, help bootstrap up and coming protocols, bolster Arbitrum native/aligned protocols, among other desires, it determined that a strong/conservative foundation for the DAO’s treasury strategy made the most sense until the DAO becomes more capable of actively managing positions.\n\nFor example, many proposals included LRT-based strategies. While the GMC did want to encourage the growth of LRTs, we did not think the direct exposure to LRTs was appropriate for the first tranche of fund deployments. Instead, we chose a sector that indirectly benefits LRTs by deepening wstETH liquidity to enable LRT looping strategies. In a different example to help explain the rationale behind our preferred choices, many applications included vote-locked/escrowed tokens as a portion of the yield, but it’s difficult to envision how these reward tokens would be managed in practice. A large number of applicants requested the DAO take on leveraged positions, which would require active management to manage liquidation risk. We also received applications from centralized entities, but felt the allocation would be most beneficial for the Arbitrum ecosystem if given to protocol applications that indirectly benefit a variety of other protocols on Arbitrum.\n\nLido, Aave, and Fluid represent safe applications that achieve conservative yield and strongly support ecosystem growth. Lido has offered a strong concession in its 20% reward share to the DAO, and has proven to be an essential protocol across a number of DeFi ecosystems. Many protocols on Arbitrum would benefit from a larger supply of wstETH on the network, and by partnering with Lido, we are able to achieve this and form a long-term relationship with a protocol that has made critical contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem. Aave falls in this camp as well, it is a well-established and battle-tested player that is easy to form a treasury management strategy around, and it has exemplified product market fit across a wide variety of DeFi ecosystems. In terms of Fluid, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi protocols, with its marketshare continually trending upwards on Ethereum mainnet thanks to its capital efficient design. Fluid is already seeing strong growth on Arbitrum One, has committed to incentivizing its Arbitrum One deployment, and the GMC believes that this growth can be fueled forward by including them in the DAO’s treasury management program. Fluid’s highest-in-class LTVs will result in maximum ecosystem value add for those users wishing to take advantage of these unique opportunities too.\n\nWe want to remind all applicants that this is hopefully the first round of many future allocations. The desire is to continually reinvest ETH and stablecoin revenue into the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem to increase DAO sustainability as well as supporting Arbitrum’s ecosystem of builders. If you were not selected this round, you will be considered in future allocations assuming the DAO supports it.\n\n# Risk Assessment (Llama Risk)\nLlamaRisk has reviewed these different strategies and finds the risk inherent to each is satisfactorily mitigated to warrant the allocation. In summary, LlamaRisk have identified the following key asset risks and strategy risks:\n\nIncremental wstETH asset risks include:\n\nLiquidity for the asset is low on Arbitrum, meaning the ETH allocation will have to be staked on mainnet then bridged over using Arbitrum’s canonical bridge.\nIncremental Aave wstETH strategy risks include:\n\nArbitrum DAO may not be able to withdraw its entire position at all times due to volatility reducing market liquidity. This risk is managed by Aave’s interest rate model, with successful effects demonstrated with the level of withdrawal liquidity of Aave V3’s Arbitrum wstETH market being over 40,000 on February 4th.\nThe yield may be lower than anticipated as liquid restaking yield is lower than was expected 6 months ago, meaning limited profit for traders leveraged longing liquid restaking tokens and shorting liquid staking tokens. This is the primary use case for those looking to short wstETH, which is demonstrated by low deposit rates for wstETH on this market.\nFluid strategy risks include:\n\nFluid DAO change management processes (e.g. LTV modifications) are not clearly structured and outlined. This could lead to changes to market critical settings going into effect without all participants knowing, which may have unintended consequences.\nA high degree of trust is placed in the core team, with access controls resting in their hands over important functions such as freezing the protocol, users and market modifications. A 7/13 multisig controls these functions, which is owned by the core team. Given that many of these signers are based in India, some degree of operational risk is introduced from frequently arbitrary regulatory rulings in this jurisdiction potentially preventing their continued compliance with the protocol’s best interest. Uncertainty remains, introducing risk.\nAs with Aave, pool liquidity risk may prevent the DAO’s entire position being withdrawn in a single transaction during periods of high volatility. Also as with Aave, Fluid competently restores market liquidity quickly through its interest rate model.\nFull risk analyses, with guiding processes, are available:\n\nwstETH asset + Aave Strategy Risk Analysis\nETH asset + Fluid Risk Analysis\n# Next Steps\nIf approved by the DAO, which per the original proposal that passed on Tally requires a Snapshot vote with a simple majority of votes signaling For/Abstain with the quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply at the time of the proposal going live, the Arbitrum Foundation can begin deploying the 7,500 ETH in accordance with the processes defined in the original applications. This proposal will move to Snapshot on Thursday, March 20, 2025.\n\nIf the DAO rejects the choice of the GMC, it will take into account the feedback from the community and alter its choices and proceed to another forum post/Snapshot vote over the coming weeks.\n\n# Full list of applications\nThe entire list of submitted applications can be found here.

        "body": "**Abstract**\n\nOn June 12th 2024, the DAO held an election for the role of STEP program manager to oversee ~$30 million diversified into liquid, stable and yield bearing RWAs. Steakhouse Financial won the vote with 60% in favor of their selection, with fees of $174,000 quoted in their application. \n\nThe Tally proposal in April 2024 listed 100k ARB as program management costs, which converted to $86,581 in June-July 2024 by the Arbitrum Foundation. This is insufficient to cover one year of Steakhouse Financials fees. Note: even if the ARB price had gone up, they would not have earned more - all applicant fees were quoted in dollar value and not ARB.\n\nThis proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options to\n- Approve only a 6 month contract from available funds\n- Earmark additional funds from yield earned so they complete the one year tenure\n- Not have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs\n- Conduct a new RFP to select a program manager for one year at $86,581\n- Abstain\n\n**Motivation** \n\nOn April 10th 2024, the DAO approved 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.\n\n \n![2024-09-12 23.22.46.jpg](ipfs://bafkreicuaeyplf7wz2ayqzy33iailoxby5zohrg4gngmda4h5q3ja5otei)\n    \n\nIn June 2024, applications for the program manager role opened up where all applicants listed their fees in dollars. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay the $174,000 listed in Steakhouse Financials application, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nWhile writing the Tally proposal, 100k ARB was budgeted for the program manager role based on a sample quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.\n\nSteakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared their budget in dollar value based on the sample provided instead of in ARB. As a result, the program manager role in the STEP program became under-budgeted and now needs approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations ,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nAfter ratification of Steakhouse Financials role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n\nPost on forum\n\nUpload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)\n\nFoundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposal\n\nAfter RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419 (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nIf the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419 paid via yield earned from the program. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.\n\nThere is no budget required for work done on this proposal as it has been paid for through a Thrivecoin ThankArbitrum firestarter grant to the treasury and sustainability working group",
