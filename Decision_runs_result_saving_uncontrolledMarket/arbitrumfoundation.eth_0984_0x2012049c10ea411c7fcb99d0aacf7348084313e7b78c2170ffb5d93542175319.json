    "summary": "The proposal from Vertex Protocol requests a sizable ARB grant (1.8M to 3M) to incentivize community market making, trading rewards, and liquidity via Elixir Fusion Pools. Despite strong user growth, trading volume, and innovation as an Arbitrum-native orderbook DEX, there is significant forum debate on the size of the grant and organic growth authenticity. The voting timeline indicates a strong early lead for the 'Against' option. Historical similar proposals show that while high incentives can boost volume, post-vote price and TVL impacts have been negative or neutral, cautioning against over-allocation. Sentiment in the forum is mixed with notable support for the protocol's innovation but concerns about grant size and potential inflated metrics due to incentives. Overall, the recommendation is to vote 'Against' to preserve DAO capital and encourage a more measured grant size that better matches protocol maturity and organic growth, despite the innovation promise.",

      "Some community members argue the grant request should be reduced to better reflect organic growth and staying power.",
