Currently, the Aave Protocol has a TVL of approximately $10.7 Billion.\n>\n>GHO is a decentralized multi-collateral stable coin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol.\n>\n>**wUSDL & Paxos**\n>\n> USDL is issued by Paxos International which is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM).\n>\n>Lift Dollar (USDL) is an ERC-20 token that distributes yield generated by its cash and cash equivalent reserve assets through a daily rebasing mechanism embedded in the smart contract. The wrapped version of USDL, wUSDL, compounds the yield over time to provide holders with a native savings rate. \n>\n>USDL Contract Address: [`0x7f850b0ab1988dd17b69ac564c1e2857949e4dee`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7f850b0ab1988dd17b69ac564c1e2857949e4dee)\n>wUSDL Contract Address: [`0x7751e2f4b8ae93ef6b79d86419d42fe3295a4559`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7751e2f4b8ae93ef6b79d86419d42fe3295a4559\n)\n\n>## Motivation\n>\n>This proposal is to enable BAL emissions to the following gauge:\n>\n>* GHO/wUSDL ComposableStable Pool on Arbitrum Amp 1,000\n>\n>Paxos is expected to provide 5M initial liquidity to seed the pool.\n>\n>At a later date, when Gyroscope has progressed through Paxo's risk assessment process, this pool may transition to an ECLP.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1668\n\n# Summary\n\nTreehouse proposes introducing a Balancer Gauge for the tETH-wstETH pool on Arbitrum without an emissions cap. [Treehouse’s tETH-wstETH pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x1d13531bf6344c102280ce4c458781fbf14dad140000000000000000000006df) on Ethereum Mainnet successfully reached a TVL of $7M, with the gauge being a key driver of this success. We are confident that implementing a similar gauge will enable us to replicate this TVL on Arbitrum.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nTreehouse is expanding its tETH offering to Arbitrum as part of our mission to enhance accessibility and reduce onboarding costs for tETH users. We have bridged tETH to Arbitrum and are in the process of establishing a Balancer pool. To further bolster liquidity, Treehouse Protocol is working to set up the tETH-wstETH (Arbitrum) Gauge on Balancer. Having a gauge will draw liquidity for our pool, and will be critical for facilitating seamless transactions for our protocol on Arbitrum.\n\n# Specifications\n\n1. **Governance:**\nAll ownable contracts are secured with a 5/7 multi-sig. Only the tETH contract is upgradable for future expansion plans.\n2. **Oracles:**\ntETH-wstETH exchange rate provider is based on wstETH as a base asset, it is not compatible with any pools aside from a wstETH pairing for the intended use of a rate provider.\n  1. tETH-wstETH Exchange Rate / Arbitrum\n    1. https://arbiscan.io/address/0x98a977Ba31C72aeF2e15B950Eb5Ae3158863D856.\n3. **Audits:**\nTreehouse Protocol has been audited by entities such as Fuzzland, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits. The reports can be viewed in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report).\n4. **Centralization vectors:**\nThe centralization vector primarily involves the execution of actions in the strategy contract, which is done by a multi-sig appointed by the contract owner. However, all action contracts are well-defined, and the executors can only perform the whitelisted actions included in the strategy contract.\n5. **Market History:**\ntETH has reached a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $360M since its launch on 10th September 2024. The tETH-wstETH Balancer pool has been in inception since 23 October 2024. More information about tETH and the Treehouse Protocol ecosystem can be found on our [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/treehouseprotocol/treehousefi).\n\ntETH-wstETH pool on Arbitrum: https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x65c2d90b33f7bf693a7ef54662435f2cf3251c210000000000000000000005e7                \n— Child gauge https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc7995A4bA51574Ecd93e777cded6900ce42ff805#code and.                                          \n— root gauge https://etherscan.io/address/0x870D8Fd230a6261DB8d4C168038E55AE3a7Eb4B2\n\n6. **Value:**\nThe tETH-wstETH pool on Balancer is designed to be a key source of liquidity for the token on the Arbitrum network. By pairing tETH with wstETH, the pool aims to provide a seamless trading experience while also offering enhanced rewards for liquidity providers. This structure is intended to optimize both liquidity and profitability within the ecosystem. In addition, users who stake their tETH-wstETH LP tokens will be able to earn points from our current ongoing points program.\n\n# Relevant Links\n\n* [Website](https://treehouse.finance/)\n* [dApp](https://app.treehouse.finance/)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/treehousefi)\n* [Twitter](https://x.com/TreehouseFi)\n* [Docs](https://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol)\n* [Github](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/tETH)\n* [Audits](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n### Technical Specification\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `e0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: gauge(address):`0x870D8Fd230a6261DB8d4C168038E55AE3a7Eb4B2` \ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/547\n\n**Summary:**\n\n> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory v5 and contains three unique staked ethereum tokens, staked frax eth (sfrxETH), wrapped staked eth from Lido (wstETH), and rocket eth from Rocket pool (rETH). As most Balancer community members know, rocket pool and lido have become pillars of the ecosystem through the use of the metastable / composable stable pool types to leverage their yield bearing assets. Staked frax eth will be joining these two juggernauts to facilitate trading and LPing amongst these diverse staking strategies of ETH. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> (sfrxETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://app.frax.finance/)\n> • [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens)\n> • [Communities](https://facts.frax.finance/frxeth/validators)\n> (wstETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://stake.lido.fi/)\n> • [Documentation](https://blog.lido.fi/)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/lidofinance)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao)\n> (rETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n> • [Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)\n> • [Github Page](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/usage/contracts/contracts.html#introduction)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sfrxETH is a Frax’s staked wrapped ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido, and rETH is the staked ETH token for Rocket Pool.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the protocols which supply staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer’s users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on each projects forum. [sfrxETH ](https://gov.frax.finance/), [wstETH](https://research.lido.fi/), [rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1)\n2. **Oracles:** See each rate provider contract linked here respectively [sfrxETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xf752dd899F87a91370C1C8ac1488Aef6be687505), [wstETH ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15), [rETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x658843BB859B7b85cEAb5cF77167e3F0a78dFE7f)\n3. **Audits:** See [sfrxETH](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits), [wstETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits), [rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd). For Lido and wstETH please read [here](https://lido.fi/faq). Lastly for FRX and sfrxETH see [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/overview).\n5. **Market History:** See [rETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth), [wstETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth), and [sfrxETH](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on all assets in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.\n\nLink to pool: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x5F8893506DDC4C271837187D14A9C87964A074DC000000000000000000000106\nLink to child gauge: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5669FB0DCfA758Bf69FB3AdAB14578EDe14cc89A\nLink to root gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6A2C2d4502335638d2c2f40f0171253fb2c2db88#readContract\n\nSpecification: \n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x6A2C2d4502335638d2c2f40f0171253fb2c2db88`\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",
