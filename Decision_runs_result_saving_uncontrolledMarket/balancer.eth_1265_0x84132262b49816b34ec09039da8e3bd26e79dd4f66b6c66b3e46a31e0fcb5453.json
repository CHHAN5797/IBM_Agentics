After over a year of development and testing, the V3 upgrade is now live on Mainnet. StakeWise V3 is the (Gnosis) Safe of ETH staking, a free public good that aims to fully democratize the staking ecosystem and greatly improve the decentralisation of staked capital. Any entity can offer trustless, non-custodial staking-as-a-service via an open marketplace that gives stakers the ability to delegate to their preferred operators/staking solutions. For more details about StakeWise V3, please refer to the [StakeWise V3 Announcement](https://stakewise.medium.com/stakewise-v3-announcement-9e4fe73abdf2).\n\nStakeWise V3 features a liquid staking token, osETH, that any staker can mint to access DeFi. osETH minting is optional and can be done on-demand, for times when a liquid staking token is needed. The liquidity and integrations for osETH are provided by StakeWise DAO, creating a ready-made liquid staking ecosystem for any operator to plug into. The osETH token has in-built slashing protection due to its overcollateralisation and accrues yield from a highly diverse set of node operators. osETH is a new token that is launching with StakeWise V3 and, consequently, there is no historical price data to refer to.\n\nThe protocol is governed by StakeWise DAO, a [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) DAO with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n## Motivation\n\nosETH will be the main LST for StakeWise moving forward and the osETH-ETH Balancer pool will be the primary liquidity venue. A gauge is necessary to help bootstrap the pool’s TVL.\n\n## Specifications\n\n**1. Governance** \nThe StakeWise DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token. The majority of the protocol’s smart contracts are immutable (incl. osETH). Contracts that are upgradable require a successful DAO vote followed by the approval of a Vault admin/owner to ensure users of the protocol retain full control over contract upgradeability.\n\n**2. Oracles** \nStakeWise relies on an Oracle network to accurately report validator balances to the protocol smart contracts. StakeWise has 11 leading commercial operators all acting under SLAs to ensure the Network runs efficiently (more information can be found [here](https://docs-v3.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oracles)).\n\n**3. Audits** \nHalborn and Sigma Prime ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)), alongside a public audit competition hosted by [Hats Finance](https://twitter.com/HatsFinance/status/1712166174459347001).\n\n**4. Centralization vectors**\nNo, both the StakeWise DAO and the Oracle network are decentralised.\n\n**5. Market History**\nNone, osETH is a newly deployed token.\n[Balancer pool link](https://app.balancer.fi/#/1/pool/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635)\n[Gauge link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc592c33e51A764B94DB0702D8BAf4035eD577aED)\n\n**6. Value**\nThis new Balancer pool will be the primary source of liquidity for the token.\n\n**Note:** The owner of the Pool is set to Balancer DAO and the Yield Protocol Fee has been disabled on this pool, thus not making it eligible for Core Pool status.\n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xc592c33e51A764B94DB0702D8BAf4035eD577aED`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1100\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to enable uncapped Balancer gauge for weETH/wstETH pool on Optimism and grant core pool status.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n• Website https://www.ether.fi/\n\n• Documentation [ether.fi Whitepaper | ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper)\n\n• Github Page [etherfi-protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol)\n\n• Twitter https://twitter.com/ether_fi\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nEther.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocol’s eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permissionless based on the protocol’s roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the ether.fi liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on ether.fi automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols.\n\nstETH is a rebase token by Lido that also represents staked ether but instead of the exchange rate accumulation method, the staking rewards are given as extra stETH. Effectively, stETH always stays pegged 1:1 with ETH and stETH token balances are updated when the oracle reports the change in the total (initial deposit + staking rewards) every day. wstETH is the wrapped version of regular stETH which allows for stETH accumulation in the contract and turns the rebase model of stETH into the C-token model of other LSTs.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nDevelop additional liquidity for weETH on Optimism\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Currently, the protocol utilizes a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed[ ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token.\n\n2. **Oracles:**\n\n[weETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xef42D000a3e85C4e71C57e2C6A1E600e86f5a91B)\n\n[wstETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xef42D000a3e85C4e71C57e2C6A1E600e86f5a91B)\n\n3. **Audits:**\n\nAudit reports for the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) protocol are found on the [GitBook page](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:**\n\nThe centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/), however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) DAO and governance.\n\n5. **Market History:**\n\neETH was first deployed November 15, 2023. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi)\n\n6. **Value:**\n\nThe weETH/wstETH pool is intended to grow into a major liquidity source for weETH or Optimism. Pairing with wstETH will give the pool good routing and ought to provide high protocol fees.\n\n**Contracts:**\n\n[weETH contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5A7fACB970D094B6C7FF1df0eA68D99E6e73CBFF)\n\n[weETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xef42D000a3e85C4e71C57e2C6A1E600e86f5a91B)\n\n[wstETH contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb)\n\n[wstETH rate provider](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9aa3cd420f830E049e2b223D0b07D8c809C94d15)\n\n[Pool link](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x2bb4712247d5f451063b5e4f6948abdfb925d93d000000000000000000000136)\n\n[Pool contract](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x2bb4712247d5f451063b5e4f6948abdfb925d93d)\n\n[Child gauge on Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xF3B314B1D2bd7d9afa8eC637716A9Bb81dBc79e5)\n\n[Root gauge on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3Db8e1Ffe58EA99939efaeF084ca23Cc0195B531)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd `and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x3Db8e1Ffe58EA99939efaeF084ca23Cc0195B531`\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1031\n\n### Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for a weETH/ wstETH E-CLP on Arbitrum.\n\nE-CLP’s asymmetric concentrated liquidity profile offers capital efficiency improvements. As per previous arrangements between Balancer and Gnosis this pool shall not bear any protocol fees for the time being.\n\n### References/Useful links\n\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\n\nDevelop additional liquidity for weETH on Arbitrum.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n#### Oracles\n\n* [weETH rate provider](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xCd9e3fb32c8F258555b8292531112bBb5B87E2F4)\n* [wstETH rate provider](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb1552c5e96b312d0bf8b554186f846c40614a540#readContract)\n\n#### Audits\n\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n#### Centralization vectors\n\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n\n## Value\n\nAs per “Motivation”.\n\n---\n\n#### Contracts\n\n* E-CLP: [0xCDCef9765D369954a4A936064535710f7235110A](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xCDCef9765D369954a4A936064535710f7235110A)\n* Childchain gauge on Arbitrum: [0xdB66fFFf713B1FA758E348e69E2f2e24595111cF](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xdB66fFFf713B1FA758E348e69E2f2e24595111cF)\n* Root gauge on Ethereum: [0xE6a0FD593e6beca161D0D933b4Fb4fecaF49d46a](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE6a0FD593e6beca161D0D933b4Fb4fecaF49d46a)\n\n---\n\n> Specification\n>\n>\n>\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the gaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd ` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>\n>\n> gauge(address): `0xE6a0FD593e6beca161D0D933b4Fb4fecaF49d46a `\n> gaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
