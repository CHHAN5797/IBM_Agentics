MakerDAO marked a significant milestone with a rebranded to Sky, introducing USDS and sUSDS as the new iterations of DAI and sDAI. Given the established track record and widespread adoption of their predecessors, we propose to onboard these new assets to Aave v3.\n\nBy integrating USDS and sUSDS into Aave v3, we aim to maintain continuity for users who have relied on DAI and sDAI while embracing the evolution of these assets under the Sky brand.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nSky protocol team has discussed providing both token incentives and liquidity provision when USDS is onboarded. ACI is in discussion with members of Sky protocol team to finalize these programs.  \n\n### **Specification**\n\nBased on discussion with members of Sky protocol team, we propose the following: \n\n- sUSDS added as collateral and borrow asset to Aave v3 Main Instance\n- USDS added as supply and borrow asset to Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Integration with Paraswap to allow users to seamlessly swap between DAI and USDS variants within the Aave system.\n\nWe invite all service providers and community members to weigh in on these suggestions. \n\nFinal contract addresses will be provided upon final launch of the Sky protocol.  \n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Sky and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "# Author: [@ACI](https://governance.aave.com/u/aci) (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n# Date: 2024-09-10\n\n## Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard Coinbase’s cbBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Base.\n\n## Motivation\n\ncbBTC, a new Bitcoin wrapper offering from Coinbase, is set to launch in the coming weeks. As a centralized and trusted entity in the cryptocurrency space, Coinbase’s entry into the wrapped Bitcoin market with cbBTC brings a unique value proposition to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nThis new asset will diversify the options available for Bitcoin holders looking to participate in DeFi activities on Aave v3. The introduction of cbBTC to Aave v3 will provide users with more choices for utilizing their Bitcoin holdings, increasing liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nFurthermore, cbBTC’s integration aligns with Aave’s commitment to offering a wide range of high-quality assets. It will enable users to tap into Coinbase’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. This synergy between a major centralized exchange and a leading DeFi protocol could attract more mainstream users to Aave, contributing to the overall growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n**Benefits of listing cbBTC:**\n\nWith the ongoing changes with WBTC it is pertinent to have alternative wrapped BTC tokens for use on Aave. With Coinbase as the issuer and custodian, their reputation will likely make this a trustworthy alternative to WBTC.\n\n### **Market Impact**\n\nThe addition of cbBTC may take marketshare from existing wrapped BTC assets including WBTC but as the purpose is to provide an alternative, this is not seen as negative. Overall, it is believed this will have slight positive impact on BTC asset adoption on Aave.\n\n### **Chain to be deployed**\n\nThis will be deployed on Base and ETH mainnet.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and deposit commitments:**\n\nThere will be $150,000 of incentives over 3 months from the Aave Merit program. \n\nThere are interested parties however, no concrete deposit commitments can be made until pool parameters have been set.\n\n### **Useful links**\n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-cbbtc-to-aave-v3-on-base/18805\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: cbBTC\n\nContract address for both Mainnet and Base: 0xcbb7c0000ab88b473b1f5afd9ef808440eed33bf\n\nFollowing the above analysis, we recommend listing cbETH on Aave V3’s Ethereum deployment.

CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. \n\nTo enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).\n\nCurrently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. \n\nOther liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. \n\nThe liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\nIntegrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.\n\nConfidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\n [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.\n\nIntegration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.\n\n### Specification\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Audits & Relevant links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n Issuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nWhitepaper: CDCETH\nDeFillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: https://crypto.com/staking\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\n\nCommunity:\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/cryptocom\nTelegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nNews on Telegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nDiscord: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.

If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.

This is a logical extension of the work Steakhouse is doing as Lido DAO’s Finance Workstream, and is a work in progress proof of the crucial role that Lido stETH can play in helping restaking become more efficient, while preserving the decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nThe onboarding of steakLRT to the Aave v3 Lido instance aims to enhance the diversity and robustness of the Aave ecosystem by integrating a novel restaking token. \n\nsteakLRT, built on Mellow and Symbiotic, brings unique value propositions and additional yield opportunities through boosted points programs. By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance. Further, beacuse steakLRT accepts wstETH deposits, there are strategic programs that can be run to increase wstETH deposit yield through looping strategies and liquidity mining. These will continue to make the Aave v3 Lido Instance the best place to deposit wstETH as collateral. \n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMellow and Symbiotic deposits held as LRTs like steakLRT earn Symbiotic and Mellow points. \n\nMellow will do an additional boosted points program for deposits into the Aave v3 Lido instance. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: [0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nsteakLRT announcement post: https://hackmd.io/@SteakhouseFi/steakLRT\n\nsteakLRT Mellow Vault: https://app.mellow.finance/restake/ethereum-steaklrt\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Steakhouse and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nSome ACI team members are investors in Mellow.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
