RLUSD intends to bridge TradFi with DeFi use cases, starting with its flagship payments products serving customers in over 70 markets. They aim to establish RLUSD as the de facto stablecoin for lending/borrowing, DeFi, repo, Treasury functions, payments, etc., all within the highest levels of compliance.\n\nOnboarding Ripple's RLUSD extends Aave Protocol's diverse stablecoin offerings to its users. RLUSD users on Aave Protocol may potentially benefit from future rewards programs. This introduction is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nAligning with Aave DAO’s commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand assets, onboarding RLUSD will enable users to leverage Ripple’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. The initial slow launch of RLUSD is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and attract more mainstream users, contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n## Specification- **Ticker**: RLUSD  \n- Contract addresses will be added during the ARFC stage once RLUSD is fully launched.  - Risk parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers as soon as possible, and the ARFC will be updated with that feedback\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Ripple and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, escalate the proposal to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "Author: ACI\nDate: 2024-10-23\nSimple Summary:\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard SCR, the native token of Scroll, on the Aave V3 Scroll Instance. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow SCR, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Scroll token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background:\nScroll is an Ethereum Layer 2 chain which already has an Aave instance deployment and SCR is the governance token for the Scroll L2. By onboarding SCR to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding SCR’s liquidity.\n\nBenefits of listing this token:\n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their SCR to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow SCR against other collateral allowing them to participate in Scroll governance.\n\nMarket Impact:\n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding SCR except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding SCR as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new L2 ecosystem.\n\nChain to be deployed/listed:\n\nScroll.\n\nProof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage. SCR will be included in future incentives programs.\n\nUseful Links:\nScroll website 1\nScroll docs\nDisclaimer:\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Scroll and did not receive compensation for creation of this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of SCR.\n\nNext Steps:\nIf consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\nCopyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

        "body": "## **Author: ACI**\n\n## **Date: 2024-10-04**\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Summary:**\n\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard EIGEN, the native token of Eigenlayer, in Aave V3 Ethereum Market. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Eigenlayer Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of EIGEN.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

MakerDAO marked a significant milestone with a rebranded to Sky, introducing USDS and sUSDS as the new iterations of DAI and sDAI. Given the established track record and widespread adoption of their predecessors, we propose to onboard these new assets to Aave v3.\n\nBy integrating USDS and sUSDS into Aave v3, we aim to maintain continuity for users who have relied on DAI and sDAI while embracing the evolution of these assets under the Sky brand.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nSky protocol team has discussed providing both token incentives and liquidity provision when USDS is onboarded. ACI is in discussion with members of Sky protocol team to finalize these programs.  \n\n### **Specification**\n\nBased on discussion with members of Sky protocol team, we propose the following: \n\n- sUSDS added as collateral and borrow asset to Aave v3 Main Instance\n- USDS added as supply and borrow asset to Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Integration with Paraswap to allow users to seamlessly swap between DAI and USDS variants within the Aave system.\n\nWe invite all service providers and community members to weigh in on these suggestions. \n\nFinal contract addresses will be provided upon final launch of the Sky protocol.  \n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Sky and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.
