        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "## Author: WorldLibertyFi\n\n## Date: 2024-10-08\n\n----------\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal suggests deploying a World Liberty Financial Aave v3 instance focused on:\n\n1. Providing stablecoin liquidity for ETH and WBTC\n2. Growing the Aave protocol user base\n\nThis proposal is subject to both AaveDAO governance approval and World Liberty Financial community approval.\n\n## Motivation and Value Proposition for Aave Protocol and DAO\n\nWorld Liberty Financial (\"WLF\") is a nascent DeFi protocol that will use Aave v3 to provide liquidity for Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, stablecoins, and potentially other digital assets, as determined by WLF governance. WLF intends to:\n\n* Promote DeFi to a wider audience through its marketing efforts\n* Introduce a new class of users to over-collateralized borrowing and lending\n* Onboard new users into DeFi by providing seamless user experiences for supplying and borrowing against digital assets\n\n### Benefits for Aave\n\n* Bring a significant number of new users and new liquidity to Aave\n* Build brand loyalty and recognition among first-time DeFi users\n* Help maintain Aave's position as a market leader in digital asset borrowing and supply\n\n### Proposal Details\n\n1. Initially, WLF's Aave v3 instance will allow USDC, USDT, ETH, and WBTC deposits\n2. Users can deposit these assets as collateral and borrow the same assets\n3. WLF will utilize the same reserve factor system as the main Aave instance\n4. AaveDAO will receive:\n\n  * 20% of the protocol fees generated by the WLF Aave v3 instance\n  * Approximately 7% of the total  supply of $WLFI tokens for:\n    * Participation in WLF Governance procedures\n    * Liquidity mining\n    * Promoting decentralization of the WLF platform\n\n5. Revenue split will be set up using a trustless smart contract\n\n### Future Vision\n\nWLF foresees onboarding assets that may not be compatible with the main market on Ethereum Mainnet, leveraging its ties to traditional finance and institutional investment.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed WLF Aave v3 instance will implement the following:\n\n1. Market inclusion: USDC, USDT, ETH, and WBTC\n2. E-Mode: Initially disabled, but may be enabled or disabled through WLF governance\n3. Risk management: Dynamic adjustment of ETH and WBTC supply caps based on stablecoin liquidity\n4. User incentives: $WLF tokens for participating in the WLF Aave v3 pools\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate to the Snapshot stage\n2. If Snapshot outcome is Yae, escalate to the ARFC stage\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback\n4. If ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

        "body": "---\n\n### [TEMP CHECK] Deploy an Ethena Aave v3 Instance\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-15\n\n---\n### Summary:\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on providing liquidity for sUSDe and USDe holders to borrow stablecoins.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEthena’s USDe stablecoin has grown to over $3b TVL with success as a supply and borrow asset on the mainnet Aave v3 instance. It has also seen large demand for use as collateral on other lending protocols.\n\nIn order to capitalize on this demand, we propose deploying a dedicated Aave v3 instance for Ethena’s stablecoins and related collateral assets. \n\nTo start the instance will use sUSDe and USDe as main collateral assets, with USDC, DAI and USDT as supply assets. \n\nWe also propose providing the Ethena instance with an initial GHO facilitator. \n\nThe goals for this instance will be to grow Aave market share for borrowers using sUSDe and USDe as well as create an additional steady revenue stream of GHO. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Ethena Aave v3 instance will implement the following:\n\n- The market will include sUSDe, USDe, USDC, DAI, USDT and a new GHO facilitator. Additional assets to consider during ARFC are Ethena’s Pendle PT tokens and rsUSDe.\n- This GHO facilitator will be limited in size to start both to limit risk to Ethena collateral and protect liquidity and the GHO peg.\n- The market will have stablecoin E-Mode to allow for high leverage borrowing between the correlated assets.\n- The market will use the existing sUSDe and USDe capped oracles, so that borrowers are not affected by fluctuations in the secondary market price.\n- Borrow parameters will match the mainnet Aave v3 instance, making it the most competitive location to borrow against sUSDe and USDe.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated by Ethena for the publication of this proposal.\n\nACI team members are holders of sUSDe, USDe and ENA.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

MakerDAO marked a significant milestone with a rebranded to Sky, introducing USDS and sUSDS as the new iterations of DAI and sDAI. Given the established track record and widespread adoption of their predecessors, we propose to onboard these new assets to Aave v3.\n\nBy integrating USDS and sUSDS into Aave v3, we aim to maintain continuity for users who have relied on DAI and sDAI while embracing the evolution of these assets under the Sky brand.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nSky protocol team has discussed providing both token incentives and liquidity provision when USDS is onboarded. ACI is in discussion with members of Sky protocol team to finalize these programs.  \n\n### **Specification**\n\nBased on discussion with members of Sky protocol team, we propose the following: \n\n- sUSDS added as collateral and borrow asset to Aave v3 Main Instance\n- USDS added as supply and borrow asset to Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Integration with Paraswap to allow users to seamlessly swap between DAI and USDS variants within the Aave system.\n\nWe invite all service providers and community members to weigh in on these suggestions. \n\nFinal contract addresses will be provided upon final launch of the Sky protocol.  \n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Sky and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
