        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2032\n\n## Summary\n\nThis publication proposed enabling new **rETH/aWETH** gauges for Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Arbitrum, Base and Optimism.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [Rocket Pool Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool GitHub](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool)\n- [Rocket Pool Twitter](https://twitter.com/rocket_pool)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol that allows users to stake ETH and receive rETH, a liquid staking token representing their staked ETH plus accrued rewards. The protocol is designed to be community-owned, decentralized, and trustless, aligning with Ethereum's core principles.\n\nrETH accrues staking rewards over time, reflecting the performance of the underlying validators operated by a decentralized network of node operators. Users can stake as little as 0.01 ETH, making staking accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), which oversees protocol parameters and upgrades, ensuring that the protocol remains community-driven and secure.\n\nFor more details, see the [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3 with an Aave Boosted pool will enhance the capital efficiency of the rETH liquidity pools. The integration of aWETH (aArbWETH; aBasWETH, aOptWETH), which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and provides liquidity providers with additional yield opportunities.\n\nThe new **rETH/aWETH** pools will serve as the primary liquidity venue for rETH on L2s, replacing the existing v2 pool. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users interacting with Aave-based strategies.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for rETH.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), comprising RPL token holders who vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes. This decentralized governance model ensures that the protocol remains aligned with the interests of its community.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nRocket Pool utilizes a decentralized oracle network operated by the Oracle DAO (oDAO), which consists of independent node operators. These oracles are responsible for reporting validator balances and other critical data to the protocol's smart contracts, ensuring accurate and reliable operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nRocket Pool's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [Rocket Pool GitHub repository](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nRocket Pool is designed to minimize centralization risks. Governance decisions are executed by the pDAO, and the oracle network is decentralized across multiple independent operators, ensuring robust security and trustlessness throughout the protocol.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nThe existing Balancer v2 rETH/WETH pools have demonstrated strong performance, serving as a significant liquidity venue for rETH. Transitioning to a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool is expected to further enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Base](https://balancer.fi/pools/base/v2/0xc771c1a5905420daec317b154eb13e4198ba97d0000000000000000000000023)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Arbitrum](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Optimism](https://balancer.fi/pools/optimism/v2/0x4fd63966879300cafafbb35d157dc5229278ed2300020000000000000000002b)\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **rETH/aWETH** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for rETH on L2s, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aWETH. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and the ease of leveraging or unwinding on lending protocols.\n\n## Specification\n\nFollowing root gauges need to be added to the gauge controller\n\n|Chain|Pool|Pool Address|Root Gauge|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Arbitrum|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x5418a64e0cdb20548ACB394f5D00a089BAf02161|0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb|\n|Base|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0xB7B8B3AfC010169779C5C2385ec0eB0477FE3347|0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6|\n|Optimism|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x870c0Af8A1af0B58b4b0bD31CE4fe72864ae45BE|0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8|\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n\ngauge(address):`0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb` \ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum` \n\ngauge(address):`0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6` \ngaugeType(string): `Base` \n\ngauge(address):`0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8` \ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload \nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1975\n\n[BIP-819] Enable Aave Boosted osETH/aWETH Gauge on Balancer v3 Arbitrum\n\n# Summary\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the new **osETH/aWETH** Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Arbitrum. \n\n# References/Useful Links\n\n- [StakeWise Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n- [StakeWise Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n- [StakeWise Github](https://github.com/stakewise)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) \n\n# Protocol Description\n\nStakeWise is a DeFi protocol that provides a simple, non-custodial, and secure way to stake ETH and GNO, while preserving access to DeFi through liquid staking tokens such as osETH and osGNO. It enables users to not only stake but also farm, restake, and borrow against their staked assets.\n\nStakeWise V3 introduces a permissionless staking marketplace that allows users to choose their own node operators, optimize staking profits, minimize slashing risk, and even operate their own Vaults. Vaults are isolated, trustless staking pools that offer fully customizable staking terms, ensuring a tailored and secure staking experience for individuals, DAOs, and institutions alike.\n\nAt the core of StakeWise V3 is osETH — a liquid staking token that offers in-built slashing protection and accrues rewards from a highly diversified network of validators. osETH minting is dependent on the Vault’s LTV ratio, with standard Vaults allowing minting up to 90% of the staked ETH value, and DAO-approved Vaults offering up to 99.99% LTV, backed by stringent requirements and a 5M SWISE bond for enhanced security.\n\nStakeWise DAO, governed by SWISE token holders, oversees protocol parameters, operator standards, and Treasury management, ensuring that the protocol remains community-driven and secure.\n\nFor more details, see the [StakeWise Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/).\n\n# Motivation\n\nTokenLogic has been working with StakeWise to adopt an Aave Boosted pool upong migration liquidity from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3. The new Aave Boosted Pool will significantly enhance the capital efficiency of the osETH liquidity pool and provide liquidity providers access to yield from Aave. \n\nThe new **osETH/aWETH** pool will replace the existing v2 pool as the primary liquidity venue for osETH. The new Aave Boosted pools will offer superior capital efficiency with WETH deposits earning yield from Aave and greater liquidity concentration, from a higher Amplification factor, is expected to enhance liquidity depth, thereby providing a better user experience whilst also generating a cost savigns for StakeWise. \n\nA gauge is critical to bootstrap TVL, strengthen liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for osETH, helping it become a core building block for staking-related strategies across the ecosystem.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## 1. Governance\n\nThe StakeWise protocol is governed by the StakeWise DAO, with all decision-making power vested in SWISE token holders. Protocol upgrades that involve upgradable contracts must undergo a community vote, followed by multisig approval, ensuring a transparent and decentralized governance process. Core infrastructure components, such as the osETH token contracts, are immutable, providing additional security and resilience to the protocol.\n\n## 2. Oracles\n\nStakeWise leverages a decentralized and independent oracle network consisting of 11 established staking service providers. These operators are bound by service-level agreements (SLAs) and are responsible for accurately and reliably reporting validator balances to the protocol’s smart contracts, ensuring transparency and operational integrity. [More information here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oracles).\n\n## 3. Audits\n\nStakeWise V3 has been audited by **Halborn**, **Sigma Prime** and Consensys. All the audits can be found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits).\n\n## 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nStakeWise is designed to minimize centralization risks. Governance decisions are executed fully on-chain by SWISE token holders, while the oracle network is decentralized across multiple independent and reputable staking operators, ensuring robust security and trustlessness at every layer of the protocol.\n\n## 5. Market History\n\nThis is a new Balancer v3 pool specifically created to provide osETH liquidity paired with aWETH (Aave-wrapped WETH). The V2 pool has been doing great for the past two years and has grown to be one of the biggest Balancer pool by TVL.\ncf: [Balancer V2 Pool, Eth](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635)\n\n## 6. Value\n\nThe **osETH/aWETH** pool will serve as the primary liquidity hub for osETH, enabling seamless integrations with major DeFi protocols that use aWETH as a base asset. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical to facilitating efficient swaps and expanding osETH’s utility.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Enable Gauges\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig '0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860' will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at '0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd' and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: 0x1a36195044abbad8807ceea78ec645c0c5d09593\n- Gauge(address): 0x0fc6169f74b1d0bbe7a269c1ee8d92edb58b1ade\n- GaugeType(string): Arbitrum\n\nMaxi Edits:\n\n* added pool address\n* added gauge address\n* add payload",

As of recent [sDAI](https://app.spark.fi/sdai/) and [sFRAX](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake) have become popular yield bearing stablecoins in the greater defi ecosystem. This proposal is meant to enable four gauges encompassing these tokens on Ethereum and Arbitrum in stable and weighted pools. The pool will sufficiently capture which captures the yield of these tokens and creates routing for the 3 primary stablecoins and wstETH to be swapped against. The pools all will be core for Balancer.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Maker Webiste](https://makerdao.com/en/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/dai/dsr-manager-docs/dsr-manager-docs.md)    \n    • [Communities](https://forum.makerdao.com/)\n> Link to: \n    • [Frax Webiste](https://app.frax.finance/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/src/types/constants.ts)    \n    • [Communities](https://gov.frax.finance/)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sDAI is part of the Maker ecosystem and utilizes the Dai Savings Rate to incentivize users to stake their DAI here https://app.spark.fi/sdai/ . \n>\n>sFRAX is from the new Frax v3 ecosystem and can be utilized [here](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake). \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer users will have a more capital efficient place to provide stable coin liquidity routes. As core pools these will receive BAL incentives over time via the BIP-19 cycle. sDAI and sFRAX will overall earn the DAO more revenue and strengthen the routing for swaps on Balancer using the underlying tokens.  \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module). Frax governance is outlined [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-governance/frax-governance-overview). \n\n2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on the [SavingsDAIRateProvider](https://0xc7177B6E18c1Abd725F5b75792e5F7A3bA5DBC2c) to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/SavingsDAIRateProvider.md). The sFRAX and wstETH oracles utilize the Chainlink feed factory or have been proven by being utilized for over a year on the platform. \n\n3. **Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits). \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n5. **Market History:** sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai). sFRAX history can be seen [here](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xfef79304c80a694dfd9e603d624567d470e1a0e7?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults). \n \n6. **Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin and wstETH liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and sFRAX.\n\nsDAI/3Pool - Mainnet\nPool: [0x49cbD67651fbabCE12d1df18499896ec87BEf46f](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x49cbd67651fbabce12d1df18499896ec87bef46f00000000000000000000064a)\nGauge: [0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4)\n\nsDAI/wstETH - Mainnet\nPool: [0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf1](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf100020000000000000000064b)\nGauge: [0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108)\n\nsFRAX/4POOL - Arbitrum \nPool: [0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27#readContract)\nChild: [0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd)\nRoot: [0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83](https://etherscan.io/address/0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83)\n\nsFRAX/wstETH - Arbitrum\nPool:  [0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f160](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f1600002000000000000000004de)\nChild: [0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653)\nRoot: [0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nThe pool will have the `core pool` status as per BIP-457",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1269\n\n## Summary:\n\nElixir proposes to add a veBAL gauge for the sdeUSD / deUSD ECLP pool on Ethereum.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\n• Website: https://www.elixir.xyz/\n\n• Documentation: https://docs.elixir.xyz/\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nElixir is a modular DPoS network built to power liquidity on orderbook exchanges.\n\n​Elixir is cross chain and composable: enabling orderbook DEXs to natively integrate Elixir into their core infrastructure to unlock retail liquidity for pairs, among other exciting use-cases. The network serves as crucial underlying infrastructure allowing for exchanges and protocols to easily bootstrap liquidity to their books.\n\n​Elixir has 30+ native integrations into the core infrastructure of leading DEXs.\n\ndeUSD (\"decentralized US Dollar\") is a fully collateralized synthetic dollar powered by the Elixir Network. Minted by stETH and sDAI, deposited collateral is used to short ETH, creating a delta neutral position.\n\nThrough leveraging this funding rate basis trade on Ethereum, the Elixir network creates a synthetic dollar capturing positive funding rates. Even in a negative funding rate environment however, deUSD is built to be resilient.\n\nThe asset is used as the preferred collateral within Elixir's ecosystem, with most Elixir-powered exchanges natively accepting it. This enables users to earn yield on their assets while boosting orderbook liquidity across a host of orderbook exchanges. The long-term vision of deUSD will be far reaching, serving as a superior cross-chain DeFi-native money.\n\nThere is currently over $100m of TVL in deUSD pools on curve (deUSD / USDT, deUSD / USDC, deUSD / DAI, deUSD / FRAX).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nElixir is seeking to establish this Balancer pool as the primary source of liquidity for sdeUSD on Ethereum. E-CLP’s asymmetric concentrated liquidity profile offers capital efficiency improvements.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. Governance: Elixir currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon.\n\n2. Oracles: Elixir’s mainnet sdeUSD rate provider has been reviewed [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/sdeUSDRateProvider.md).\n\n3. Audits: Elixir's deUSD token and related staking contracts were audited by Quantstamp and has an ongoing bug bounty program. [More here](https://docs.elixir.xyz/audit).\n\n4. Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\n5. Market History: Elixir has seen significant growth in TVL since launch with TVL over $100M.\n\nThe balancer pools are already live and are available on Ethereum\n\nEthereum pool:\n\nhttps://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x41fdbea2e52790c0a1dc374f07b628741f2e062d0002000000000000000006be\n\nGauge Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa00db7d9c465e95e4aa814a9340b9a161364470a\n\n## Technical Specifications:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xA00DB7d9c465e95e4AA814A9340B9A161364470a`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/949\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Base, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Base: 0x99aC4484e8a1dbd6A185380B3A811913Ac884D87\n\nsDAI / aUSDC Base pool on Gyro: https://app.gyro.finance/pools/base/e-clp/0x821afe819450a359e29a5209c48f2fa3321c8ad2/\n\nChild chain gauge: [https://basescan.org/address/0x6A3F93bB18fbdDea76169D3D94d03371E9e0DdC4#code]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1\n\ngaugeType(string): Base",
