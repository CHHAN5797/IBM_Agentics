        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Prime Instance - wstETH Borrow Rate + rsETH Supply Cap Update \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-01-14\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes reducing the wstETH Slope1 and increasing the rsETH Supply Cap.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Prime instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum has experienced significant growth since its launch in Q3 2024, attracting over $2 billion in user deposits.\n\nTo support continued growth, this proposal suggests lowering the wstETH Slope1 parameter to align the borrow rate with market conditions. Based on feedback from the Renzo and Kelp teams, this adjustment is expected to drive an additional $300 million in user deposits to the Prime instance.\n\nExpected Benefits of Reducing the Slope1 Parameter:\n\n* ~72% increase in LRT deposits.\n* ~50% increase in the wstETH Deposit Rate to 60 bps.\n* ~50% increase in wstETH Borrow Rate fee generation.\n* ~35% increase in the native wETH Deposit Rate.\n\nLowering the Slope1 parameter will encourage new LRT deposits, boosting the LRT/LST yield-generating strategy, which is projected to outperform the LST/wETH strategy. With LRT deposit incentives, this strategy further enhances Prime's appeal.\n\nAs utilisation of wETH reserves across Core, Spark, and Prime approaches Uoptimal, the Prime instance of Aave v3 offers the highest native yield for LST/wETH yield strategies. The improved wstETH deposit rate solidifies Prime's competitive position in the market.\n\n## rsETH Supply Cap\n\nrsETH has shown strong growth on the Core instance of Aave v3, while the Prime market has yet to attract rsETH deposits due to the lower wstETH Borrow Rate on Core and a small supply cap.\n\nLowering the wstETH Borrow Rate on Prime would make borrowing wstETH more attractive. Feedback from the Kelp team suggests strong demand for rsETH beyond the current supply cap's capacity.\n\nTo support leveraged LRT/LST yield strategies, this proposal recommends a significant increase to the rsETH supply cap, enabling larger deposits to scale effectively, optimize returns, and reduce reliance on incentives. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters on the Prime instance are to be adjusted.\n\n**wstETH Reserve**\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n|  ---    | :---:       | :---:        |\n|Uoptimal | 90.00%      | 90.00%       |\n|Base     | 0.00%       | 0.00%        |\n|Slope1   | 1.75%       | 0.75%        |\n|Slope2   | 85.00%      | 85.00%       |\n\n**rsETH Supply Cap**\n\n| Parameter |Current Value|Proposed Value|\n|  :-----    | :---:       | :---:        |\n|Supply Cap | 10,000      | 65,000       |\n\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Lido Instance - wstETH Slope1 & Uoptimal Update\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-09-16\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes improving the capital efficiency of the wstETH Reserve on the Lido instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum by increasing Uoptimal from 45.00% to 80.00% and reducing the Slope1 from 3.50% to 2.25%.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal recommends revising the wstETH borrow rate ahead of the introduction of Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) and the creation of several new eModes on the Lido instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum.\n\nThe upcoming Liquid eModes upgrade will allow a single asset to be included in multiple eModes. As we onboard various LRTs, our goal is to promote the use of wstETH as a debt asset to enhance the returns of the wstETH/wETH yield strategy.\n\nBy increasing the Uoptimal of the wstETH reserve, we can significantly improve its capital efficiency. Strategists using LRTs as collateral and borrowing wstETH to generate yield will be able to borrow a larger portion of the wstETH that in turn generates a wstETH deposit yield.\n\nThe wstETH deposit yield will offset the wETH borrowing costs. Depending on market conditions, this could lead to a future proposal that fine-tunes the wETH and wstETH Slope1 parameters to balance the wETH deposit yield, revenue, and the performance of the wstETH/ETH yield strategy. Optimizing these parameters is expected to significantly reduce the payback period on the Lido instance and improve the DAO’s overall return on investment.\n\nA separate proposal will provide details on the new eMode configurations being introduced to the Lido instance of Aave v3. This publication focuses specifically on optimizing the wstETH Uoptimal to improve capital efficiency in preparation for LRT onboarding.\n\nWhilst several teams are expected to offer incentives for strategies involving LRT collateral and wstETH debt, general market conditions are not sufficiently buoyant to support retaining the current 3.50% Slope1 parameter.\n\nWhilst we expect strong demand for wstETH debt from users wanting to leverage farm LRT point incentives. Our research indicates sufficient demand emerges when the Slope1 is within the 2.00% to 2.50% range. As a result, this publication proposes reducing the Slope1 from 3.50% to 2.25%.\n\nBy revising the Slope1 and Uoptimal configuration for the wstETH reserve, we expect LRT deposits to drive significant AUM growth for the Lido instance.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe Lido instance wstETH Slope1 and Uoptimal are to be revised as follows:\n\n|Description|Current|Proposed| Change   |\n| --------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |\n|Slope1     | 3.50% |   2.25%|  -1.25%  |\n|Uopitimal  | 45.00%|  80.00%|  35.00%  |\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will be submitted to implement the proposed upgrade.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Summary\nThis publication proposes progressively increasing the Reserve Factor (RF) for Bridged USDC(USDC.e & USDbC) across Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Base Aave deployments.\n\n## Motivation\nPresently, Bridged USDC (USDC.e & USDbC) competes with native USDC on the listed markets. By gradually increasing the RF for Bridged USDC(USDC.e & USDbC), the deposit rate on these markets will become less attractive over time. Similar to other proposals, this action is expected to encourage users to switch to native USDC on the respective market.\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99% every 2 weeks, subject to market conditions. The RF amendments will be incorporated into the fortnightly RF and Borrow Rate adjustment AIP to reduce voting overhead.\n\nThis method has already been implemented on Polygon v2, Ethereum v2 and also Avalanche.\n\n## Specification\nThe below shows the current RF and proposed adjustments for the first AIP.\n\n| Asset |\tMarket |\tCurrent RF |\tProposed RF |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| USDC.e |\tArbitrum |\t20.00% |\t25.00% |\n| USDC.e |\tOptimism |\t20.00% |\t25.00% |\n| USDC.e |\tPolygon |\t20.00% |\t25.00% |\n| USDbC |\tBase |\t20.00% |\t25.00% |\nSubsequent AIPs will utilise the Direct-to-AIP process and increase the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%.\n\nWhere practical, this AIP will be bundled with other Borrow Rate and RF amendments to reduce voting overheads.\n\n## Disclosure\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage.\n4. Subsequent AIP submissions are expected to follow every 14 days thereafter, if deemed applicable.\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

    "summary": "This proposal recommends updating and lowering the wstETH Borrow Rate across multiple Aave v3 instances (Arbitrum, Base, Scroll, zkSync) to harmonize rates, support LRT adoption, and improve borrowing affordability. The change aims to stabilize interest rates, promote liquidity, and increase revenue while allowing incentive budgets to stretch further. Similar past proposals with aligned goals also passed with strong support.",
