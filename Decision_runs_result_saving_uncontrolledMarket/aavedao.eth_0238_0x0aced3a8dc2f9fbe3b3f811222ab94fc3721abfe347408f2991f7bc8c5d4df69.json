        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-02-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince its initial [funding in October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/), the Aave Liquidity Committee (previously GLC) has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools.\n \nAs a result of these efforts:\n\n* Deeper on-chain liquidity\n* Lower slippage, especially for GHO to USDC swaps\n\nIn combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC's initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery.\n\nThroughout the period, the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and, more frequently, Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility. A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).\n\nWhile some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.\n\nConcentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. \n\nThe following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:\n\n* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume \n    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period\n    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility \n*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP\n    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced\n* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks\n    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiex2m345ibzurmui7f3vz7l5w23sv53ej6fj5tppcqcphfsf3p2l4)\nSource: [karpatkey - Dune Analytics - ](https://dune.com/karpatkey/gho-debt-and-token-metrics)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreib2sefybdb73e7g4wksg7mk5wlj3ul53plmw3hrpbmpltn3wlxzu4)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-pools)\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiabucrlngizdmx25lzi23uorxsgkzoxm6da7tksdmhnw7cbpqqvue)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-committee)\n\nThe next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:\n\n* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD \n* Reducing price volatility\n* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations\n* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools\n* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases\n\nThese efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). \n\nThough there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:\n\n| Objective | Category | Budget   |\n| --------  | --------  | -------- |\n| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |\n| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |\n|Total| | 500k GHO|\n\nIt is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Performance Indicators\n\nThe below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:\n\n| Description| Optimal Value|\n| --------  | --------  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |\n| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\nThe [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. \n\nEach of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.\n\n# Specification\n\nSwap the following assets for GHO:\n\n* 250k aUSDT\n* 250k aUSDC\n\nCreate an allowance for 500k GHO.\n\nALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n1.

Although some users will be eligible to withdraw GHO before the GSM is funded, the GSM is intended to be funded before some of the later holdings exit cool down. \n\n| SM Category | Size | Cool Down Date |\n| :---:       | :---:| :---:          |\n| stkGHO      | 1.4M |  06/05/2024    |\n| stkGHO      | 3.0M |  08/05/2024    |\n| stkGHO      | 0.9M |  10/05/2024    |\n| stkGHO      | 2.4M |  19/05/2024    |\n\nSource: [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/queries/2816986/4697667)\n\nWith the introduction of the Merit rewards expected to be included in the Aave Protocol frontend very soon and AAVE emissions flowing to depositors, we expect several of these addresses will recommit to holding GHO within the SM. \n\n# Specification\n\nTwo Allowances are to be created enabling the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) to draw 1M USDC and 1M USDT from Aave v3.\n\nWhen market conditions are optimal, the ALC will fund the USDC and USDT GSMs.\n\nDo note the GSMs are currently configured to receive a maximum of 500k USDC and 500k of USDT. The additional USDC and USDT will be drawn down by the ALC when GHO Stewards determine those funds are needed at each respective GSM.\n\nALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n| Asset | Asset| GSM Address |\n| :---: | :---:| :---:|\n| USDT  | 1M   | `0x686F8D21520f4ecEc7ba577be08354F4d1EB8262` |\n| USDC  | 1M   | `0x0d8eFfC11dF3F229AA1EA0509BC9DFa632A13578` |\n\nThe resulting GHO is to be kept in the ALC until its future use is dictated by governance.\n\nThis proposal will route via Snapshot before being submitted to AIP. \n\nFuture GSM related proposals, such as this one, are to be implemented via the Direct-to-AIP process.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, ACI and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Funding Update\nauthor: \n@TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @scottincrypto \n@r3genFinance - @Elliott_r3gen, @Pepperoni_Jo3_r3gen\ncreated: 2023-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Create and Fund GHO Liquidity Committee\nAuthor: @TokenLogic\nDated: 2023-09-08\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents Aave DAO the opportunity to create and fund the GHO Liquidity Committee for an initial 3 month duration.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the coming weeks, we expect the voting base to reallocate gauge votes away from GHO liquidity pools. This is largely due to those voting for GHO pools incurring an opportunity cost by not participating in the bribe market.\n\nIf the Aave DAO was to lock all of its BPT for veBAL, the gauge vote is equivalent to 1.8% of veBAL. Even with some voters continuing to support GHO, a good portion of the 7.7% will move to other pools. There is also the impact of [AIP-42](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682) for the DAO to consider. Voting support from external teams is expected to taper beyond what Aave DAO can replace with its own strategic assets. Furthermore, as the liquidity pools continue to grow additional gauge voting support is required to maintain the APR over time. Whilst the Aave Safety Module (SM) has the potential to be a more long term sustained solution, integrating BPTs that contain GHO, this requires time to develop and should not be rushed.\n\nMeanwhile, the [GHO price](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/) is consistently trading between 96 cents and 99 cents. When the liquidity in the GHO/Aave Boosted Pool was withdrawn, the GHO peg improved. This is because the pool was >85% GHO and had minimal USDC, USDT and DAI deposits. Increasing the GHO borrow rate is also expected to support the GHO peg as minting GHO to farm rewards in liquidity pools is less profitable.\n\n![|602x231](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7_4E7_tF8xRZe5tUFyoeXnJB3UbWDs7C7aGaohFzMjxM_aBGLmMvAREOjrtIS5yppMcrUaov3Q18-jIGcnjJk4x17wy91VheIUZSkIa0Y2a9Ay_kLTLRZ0w6zKR8PEpjE3jqJIBPzfF)\n\nThe LUSD/GHO pool on Maverick, is also heavily concentrated in GHO and migrating this liquidity to a wider liquidity band pool is expected to also help support the peg.\n\nCreating several concentrated liquidity pools is expected to help improve the GHO peg. These pools will have wide and narrow ranges. Liquidity will need to be migrated from the wide range to the narrow range pool over time. This will require more active management than what on-chain governance allows.\n\nThe recent CRV acquisition indicates the DAO will likely be supporting a GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve Finance. The current CRV holding can be used to kick start a pool, however additional support is likely to be needed to continue growing the pool. There is also a GHOFRAXBP pool being setup by the Frax team which can be co-incentivised. Pending how these pools progress, additional scope/budget may be added at a later stage.\n\nGiven the time sensitive nature of needing to support GHO liquidity, this publication proposes creating a Liquidity Committee with an initial budget. The committee shall focus solely on GHO liquidity and shall consist of a relatively small highly skilled team.\n\nThe Liquidity Committee can support GHO whilst other initiatives are being considered. Even after GHO liquidity pool receipt tokens are integrated into the SM, the Liquidity Committee can participate in bribe markets to boost the yield on the SM integrations.\n\nLonger term the DAO should revisit the impact of the committee and determine if it is still required. Furthermore, the composition of the committee should be revisited at a late date. With this in mind, this proposal suggests the Liquidity Committee’s initial mandate shall last for a 3 month duration.\n\n# Liquidity Strategy\n\nDetails on the liquidity strategy are to be detailed in a separate forum post. The liquidity strategy is to be implemented on the following Decentralise Exchanges:\n\n* Balancer\n* Maverick\n* Uniswap via Bunni\n\nThis forum post is to focus on the creation of the Liquidity Committee and associated fundings.\n\n# Performance Measures\n\nThe following performance measures are proposed:\n\n* Time GHO peg is above 98.5 cents and 99.0 cents\n  * % above/below 98.5 cents over trailing 7 days\n  * % above/below 99.0 cents over trailing 7 days\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Maverick\n  * Target $5M\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Uniswap\n  * Target $5M\n* Improvement in swap size for defined price impact via Cowswap or Paraswap\n  * 0.25% and 0.5% price impact to USDC\n* TVL in Balancer Liquidity Pools\n\nTarget $10M ($5M per pool)\n\nThese measures will be shown on the GHO Analytics platform provided by TokenLogic.\n\n# Committee Structure\n\nThe Liquidity Committee is to consist of 7 signers and will utilise a 4 of 7 SAFE to implement transactions. To ensure there is smooth operational consistency, there are distinct roles within the committee.\n\nTokenLogic will perform the following function:\n\n* Provide analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy\n* Liaise with teams that support the protocols hosting the GHO liquidity\n* Lead & Coordinate the committees weekly activities\n\nAll signers are to provide the following support:\n\n* Provide critical feedback / help refine the strategy\n* Verify and sign transactions\n\nIt should be noted, that actively managing liquidity takes time and effort to stay up to date with the attest events happening across all the protocols supporting GHO liquidity. Verifying transactions as a signer is also a notable time commitment.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe initial 3 months funding for the Liquidity Committee is as shown below:\n\n* 406,000 GHO - Liquidity Incentives\n* 5 ETH - Gas\n\nA breakdown of the Liquidity Incentive budget is shown below:\n![|602x224](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_P69n971i9uu38kLAiBQKpiESXHTZJc__Q6PKuvWCxxp7ZaHn7zU-eEVpFSHFcD1W2ZurPx49T-W4Dg0fY25krVHC07nZ0_XCQtyylq9LPafWuxv-G4Ca-19mWfE2-URZ-6BL94nIhH)\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the incentive budget and strategy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801).\n\nThere is a nominal 5 ETH allowance included in the budget. This amount was arbitrarily selected and ensures the SAFE & signing wallets are well funded.Some transactions can be executed directly from the SAFE.\n\nAny funds not used shall be returned to the Treasury or rolled over into supporting the next iteration of the Liquidity Committee.\n\n# Specification\n\nA Gnosis Safe will be created, this SAFE will hold funds and implement the quests. A small, high context team is proposed to implement the strategies modelled by the TokenLogic team.\n\n|Signer|Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Matthew Graham (TokenLogic)|0xb647055A9915bF9c8021a684E175A353525b9890|\n|Dydymoon (TokenLogic)|0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f|\n|Emilio|0x9C3E82658d10064121048A21c69978D3400abb25|\n|Marc (ACI)|0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4|\n|Figue (Paladin)|0x009d13E9bEC94Bf16791098CE4E5C168D27A9f07|\n|Solarcurve (Balancer)|0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3|\n|TokenBrice (DeFi Collective)|0xAA7A9d80971E58641442774C373C94AaFee87d66|\n\nTo fund the multisig, the following assets within the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO:\n\n* 406,000 [aEthDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n5 ETH and 406,000 units GHO are to be transferred from the Treasury to the Liquidity Committee multisig.\n\nAddress: `here`\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Safety Module - Create GHO/USDC E-CLP Category\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-05-25\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes creating a new Safety Module (SM) category for the GHO/USDC E-CLP by Gyroscope built on Balancer v2.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the initial [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x1f0f0a63eeb34f9fc6a176527253495e43cefc28714734dbee79d9f33e943a67) vote passing, this publication progresses the proposal to add the GHO/USDC E-CLP to the Aave SM to ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\nWith GHO trading close to $1.00 and the [GHO Stability Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-fund-usdc-usdt-gsm/17566) to be funded, now is an ideal time to add a GHO LP to the SM. By adding the GHO-USDC E-CLP, it is expected to significantly improve market depth as well as USDC liquidity with the SM.\n\nThe GHO/USDC E-CLP pool requires dual asset deposits when Liquidity Providers enter the pool and when GHO is trading at $1.000, the pool is mostly USDC (75%). The pool's liquidity distribution is optimised for swap volume with Peak liquidity at 0.9995 reflecting that GHO is more likely to trade just beneath $1.000 than over. The upper and lower liquidity range was set to optimise the efficiency of the liquidity whilst still providing some USDC depth to the lower bound. The below provides a graphic representation of the liquidity profile and composition of the pool for GHO priced in USDC. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-05-23 at 18.45.52](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkfJ-baQ0.png)\n\n| Description   | Value  |\n| ------------- |:------:|\n| Lower Bound   | $0.996 |\n| Upper Bound   | $1.001 |\n| Peak          | 0.9995 |\n| Amplification | 1,250  |\n\nFuther details on the pool can be found [here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x006d7e2166472f62f0e9e5c95e3a313e01caea74000200000000000000000690).\n\nThe ability to stake GHO liquidity pool tokens improves the value proposition of the SM by providing the dual service of deep GHO liquidity and protection in the case of protocol shortfall events. Additionally, Liquidity Providers (LPs) can also benefit from earning trading fees.\n\n# Specification\n\nCreate a new GHO/USDC E-CLP SM Category which accepts the following Balancer Protocol Token (BPT).\n\nBPT: `0x006D7e2166472F62F0E9E5c95E3a313E01CaeA74`\n\nThe following initial E-CLP SM parameter configuration is proposed optimizing emissions for a target liquidity of $5M at 20% APR:\n\n| Description            | Value              |\n| ---                    | :---:              |\n| Emissions Nomination   | GHO                |\n| Daily Emission         | 2,750              |\n| Slashing Rate          | 50%                |\n| Cooldown Period        | 20 days            |\n\nThis proposal also recommends that GHO/USDC E-LCP is included in FastPass with the following initial parameters:\n\n| Description            | Value              |\n| ---                    | :---:              |\n| FastPass Fee           | 100 bps            |\n| Fee Destination        | Collector Contract |\n| Daily Withdrawal Limit | 500k               |\n\nIn addition to the above, we also recommend implementing the strategy detailed in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gho-usdc-usdt-bpt-to-safety-module/15195) which enables the DAO via the vlAURA holding to vote BAL and AURA rewards to this SM Category. This option then enables the Aave DAO to use is strategic assets to partially sustain the SM category.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "ai_final_reason": "- Voting timeline metrics strongly favor 'YAE' with full stability and early support.\n- Similar past proposals funding liquidity committees resulted in successful outcomes with positive or neutral market and TVL impacts.\n- Forum sentiment is negative but limited in volume, indicating the recommendation diverges from forum opinion but aligns with broad voter behavior.\n- Market price impact is positive and supports funding for liquidity growth, despite slight TVL decline.\n- Recommendation prioritizes long-term organizational benefit by supporting liquidity, despite limited forum negativity.",
