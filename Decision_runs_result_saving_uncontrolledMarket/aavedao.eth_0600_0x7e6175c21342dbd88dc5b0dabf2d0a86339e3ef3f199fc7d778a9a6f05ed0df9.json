        "body": "Summary\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.\n\nProposal\nBorn out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top notch scalability; built-in on-chain reputation through the Matrix Reputation Power System, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nThe Metis Layer 2 utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereum’s underlying security. As of right now, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitalik’s proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a, first of its kind, Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollup’s security with plasma’s scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next 2 verticals.\n\nOur second vertical is the Matrix Reputation Power System, a web3 identity system providing a framework to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain reputation: portable and composable reputation earned through on-chain achievements and history. As we all know, in traditional settings and Web2, our data is not ours; Matrix changes this. Soulbound tokens will also allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren’t previously available for Web3. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 companies looking to transition to Web3 without facing a huge UI change.\n\nThird, our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework, for seamless onboarding of Web2 onto Web3. DAOs have been crucial for our space, but they lack a clear structure and the right tools to make them suitable for Web2 organizations. DACs, on the other hand, will allow Web2 organizations to tailor these to their preference. By combining DACs and our Polis Middleware, Web2 organizations will have access to a repertoire of smart contract templates, allowing them to deploy without the need of code: seamless, tailored Web2 experiences.\n\nWhen combining all these components, we will allow dApps, Web2 apps and organizations, and/or TradFi to enjoy a seamless onboarding experience and manage their day to day operations in a decentralized and immutable way, while taking advantage of the functionalities provided by on-chain reputation, and the scalability provided by the base Layer 2. The perfect suite for dApps, web2 platforms, or any builder.\n\nCommitted to support our ecosystem builders and see them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can support projects in 3 main ways:\n-Builder Mining Rewards (Secured)\n-Ecosystem Grants (Application/Approval based)\n-Genesi DAC Investments (Application/Approval based)\n\n*The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices).\n\nAs we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting Decentralized Finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets to support the Web3 economy we are building towards. We believe that with Metis-Aave integration, these foundations can be built in a decentralized and scalable way, secured by Ethereum, and welcoming for Web2. Through this integration, AAVE can also generate an extra revenue stream while ramping up its expansion to up and coming Ethereum Layer 2s. \n\nMetis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future in Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a surging DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aave’s multichain expansion. There are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from, including Builder Mining Rewards, EVM Equivalence, our Smart L2 architecture, and a healthy mix of native and multichain protocols like LayerZero, Hummus, MaiFinance, Hermes, and much more.\n\nMetis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity, while securing the Andromeda and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network.\n\nMetis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.",

        "body": "Summary\n\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.\nProposal\nFounded in 2019, Metis launched its Layer 2 mainnet on November 19, 2021. We are building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution with fast and cheap transactions; no-code integration via a middleware layer powered by smart contract templates; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) infrastructure enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain, with all the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.\nA mere eight weeks after launching Andromeda mainnet, Metis TVL surpassed the majority of its competitors, surging to the #3 spot as measured by L2Beat and reaching $500M+ TVL. As the fastest growing L2, Metis has taken the blockchain world by storm with its Optimistic Rollup technology, EVM-Equivalence, and incredible mutually-incentivized ecosystem. With a robust and secure infrastructure, a self-deployed Graph node, multiple oracle providers, on-chain explorers, and a dedicated integrations team ready to assist throughout every step of the porting process, Metis is ready for Aave integration.\nMetis envisions and supports a multichain future and seeks to invite Aave to expand its own mission of creating a multichain future, by having Aave enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aave’s multichain expansion. As well, there are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from.\nMetis’ commitment to a decentralized future is built into its very structure, including the ethos of creating a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem where its partners are set up to thrive. This is best exemplified by Metis’ Builder Mining Program. This program allows all DApps deployed on Andromeda to directly participate in the revenue Metis generates. For example: if Aave deployed on Andromeda, 30% of the fees accrued from every single transaction occurring through Aave would be kicked back directly back to Aave, in perpetuity.\nThe mission at Metis is to provide the infrastructure and incentive system to make deployment on our network a no-brainer. This additional revenue will be going to the Aave DAO’s treasury and as such, will be able to be utilized as seen fit by the Aave community at large.\nMetis also has some of the fastest transactions in blockchain, often executing faster than your web browser can process them, and always executing faster than MetaMask can record them. Transactions on our Layer 2 network currently cost about $2-$3, considerably less than the gas fees on Layer 1 Ethereum. Metis will launch its own storage layer by the end of Q1 2022, which will enable cheap, secure storage of NFTs and other large blocks of data, while doubling as an additional scalability layer; as a result, transaction fees will drop to just cents by the end of Q1 2022.\nThe traction earned by our popular DeFi protocols are great case studies to the adoption and eagerness of the Metis community to engage with our DeFi ecosystem. Netswap, the first ever native Layer 2 DEX, surpassed $1B in trading volume in its first month of operation. Likewise, popular yield optimization protocols Beefy Finance and Pickle Finance have achieved great success since integrating and launching their protocols on Andromeda.\nMetis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We are considering the options of qualifying airdrops for interaction with the protocol on Andromeda and building Reputation Power (allowing for future whitelisting opportunities) for Aave holders voting on this proposal. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network.\nMetis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.\n\nLinks:\nWebsite: https://metis.io \nMedium: https://metisdao.medium.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MetisDAO\nTelegram: https://t.me/MetisDAO\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/RqfEJZXnxd\nGithub: https://github.com/MetisProtocol\nDocumentation: https://docs.metis.io\nGovernance Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-v3-on-metis/7056\n\n",

        "body": "**Summary:**\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll testnet.\n\n**Proposal TL;DR:**\nAave has been trailblazing DeFi since inception and continues to embrace new frontiers and innovation to this day. The protocol has become a dominant player in DeFi lending across networks - be it alt L1s or L2s. Scroll wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and propose to the Aave community to authorize the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll testnet.\n\nZk rollups are widely considered to be the holy grail of Ethereum scaling. Recent breakthroughs have allowed the space to mature much faster than originally anticipated 1, which has positioned Scroll to build the next generation of scaling solutions that has achieved:\n\n- bytecode compatibility with the EVM: No new languages, tooling, trust in custom architecture or re-audits needed. Aave will be able to port over its codebase instantly and seamlessly without any extra engineering resources required.\n- top-tier security through process and architecture: Scroll has been open-sourced from day one and has been designed to prioritize the decentralization of its prover and sequencer networks, making it unique in the zk rollup space.\n- pushing boundaries of cutting edge research: Establishing a presence on Scroll will allow Aave to capture the zkEVM market in advance and reap L2 native innovation from the start and even contribute to steering how L2 user behavior will evolve short and long-term.\n\nGenerally, we believe that Aave’s community and the ecosystem Scroll is striving for are closely aligned: both projects are building towards trustless and decentralized financial infrastructure that is accessible to anyone regardless of merit or location. In the following we detail Scroll’s architecture and mission and how it will benefit the Aave community. We look forward to receiving feedback and are happy to answer the community’s questions.\n\n**About Scroll**\nScroll 1 is a native zkEVM Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. We are committed to building an EVM equivalent zk rollup to help Ethereum become more scalable without sacrificing security.\n\nEVM equivalence & Developer Friendliness: Anything less than bytecode level compatibility is an unnecessary risk that protocols should not settle for. We don’t think developers should have to learn a new language or trust custom architecture which introduces unknown risk. Scroll reuses Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure and will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Developers can work with a familiar development environment. No bytecode re-audits will be required minimizing the risk surface tremendously.\n- Community first: Scroll originated in close collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation - built with the community for the community! That also means that Scroll has been peer reviewed and open source from day one. We intend to follow this strategy going forward. We will foster community innovation and participate in the incubation of new open source tools and features for the L2 space. We intend to be the #1 platform for developers and we are working with the best to achieve this (Ethereum Foundation (PSE), 0xparc, zcash, Filecoin, and many more).\n- Decentralization & Security: Scroll is pioneering a decentralized prover network and is committed to outsource proof generation. By decentralizing proof generation to the community, Scroll will also have efficient proof generation and a more robust ecosystem. In addition to that Scroll has a strong in-house security team that found and reported bugs in fellow zk RU’s proving systems in the past.\n- Education & Research: We pride ourselves in making research accessible to all. We continuously publish research in an effort to demystify the inner works of zk circuits (see https://scroll.io/blog and our public zk reading group). Scroll has been able to establish a recognized and sought after brand within a short amount of time which is also due to event series like Rollup Day which was appreciated across the board of L2 industry leaders.\n- Advance Ethereum’s ultimate goal: zkEVM will not only be limited to Layer 2, it will also be used to scale Layer 1. Construction and testing of Scroll will further advance Ethereum’s ultimate goal of “zkSNARK Everything” . Contribute to building a decentralized and efficient future for Ethereum!\n\nWe are live on testnet and our ecosystem is rapidly growing. Since the beginning of January 2023 our testnet has seen over 900k unique wallet addresses, and this month we’ve averaged over 500k transactions a day — all helping to test the robustness of our network. We have been working with major infrastructure players (including the Graph, Safe, Covalent, Orbiter, and many more) to add support for critical building blocks on the network, and we’re working with best-in-class Ethereum dApps to join the network too (including Uniswap v3 on Scroll testnet).\n\n**Aave on Scroll**\nBy launching on testnet, Aave has the opportunity to be part of this battle testing process and get a head start in the zk rollup ecosystem. In addition, many protocols who are looking to launch on Scroll have asked for integration with lending protocols such as Aave. Aave is a uniquely important DeFi lender in the Ethereum ecosystem and pioneers how the ecosystem and user behavior evolves and can continue to do so by benefiting from the explosion of potential use cases that a zk L2 affords.\n\nWe are only at the brink of uncovering L2 native use cases that have not been feasible on Ethereum Layer 1 as of now (e.g. going beyond flashloans with atomic (cross zk-RU) txs in a post-Danksharding Ethereum and further use cases we’d love to co-develop). Scroll is incentivizing developers globally to break frontiers by funding research grants, hosting educational workshops and continuously making cutting edge research publicly available. We are excited to help foster an ecosystem fuelled by creativity that revolves around Aave and the distribution of $GHO.\n\n**Bridge Security**\nZk rollup is currently the most secure Layer 2 scaling solution. On the premise of inheriting the security of Ethereum, it relies exclusively on cryptography, rather than unreliable crypto-economics.\n\nCurrently, Scroll has a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge, which supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is much more secure than classical relayer-based bridges.\n\nSecurity is the first priority for us. Scroll implements the EVM which is well-specified and battle-tested. Additionally, we have an in-house security team working with 10+ external auditors who keep a close eye on the security of our codebase.\n\n**Timeline**\nThe Scroll team will first submit the necessary snapshots for deploying Aave v3 on our testnet, following the community guidelines and working with BDG Labs on what is required. The current testnet already supports the deployment of contracts. Since we are fully compatible with EVM, it is very easy to deploy on Scroll. We expect the full deployment will take 2-3 weeks and we commit to dedicating engineering resources to support the Aave integrations team.\n\nIt is important to us to be closely in touch with the Aave community from the start and want to ensure that everything runs smoothly before starting the full governance process for the mainnet deployment.\n\n**References**\nScroll Github: https://github.com/scroll-tech/\nScroll Testnet Docs: https://guide.scroll.io/\nBlock Explorer: https://l2scan.scroll.io/blocks\nBlog Posts: https://scroll.io/blog\n\n**Technicalities**\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Our nodes expose all standard geth APIs, but Erigon’s. We do not have support for trace_* endpoints, but currently maintain scroll_* that could be adapted if required.\n- Indexers: Covalent is currently indexing our network and we do have theGraph support\n- Oracles: we have a number of oracle providers deployed on our testnet such Redstone as well as Witnet and working with Chainlink to have immediate mainnet support\n- Being bytecode-compatible, Scroll works out-of-the-box with all Solidity tooling. (See here)\n- Wallets: we do have Safe, Ledger, Coinbase wallet and Metamask support (and working with many aa wallets such as Soulwallet and others)\nAddress formatting: Scroll has the exact same address formatting than Ethereum",

        "body": "Summary\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Neon EVM Devnet.\n\nProposal\nTo support Aave’s multichain expansion, we propose the deployment of Aave V3 to Neon EVM on behalf of the community. \n\nNeon EVM is a first-of-kind EVM-compatibility solution for the Solana blockchain. The tool allows Ethereum-like transactions to be processed on Solana, allowing Ethereum dApp developers to leverage their knowledge of Solidity, developer tooling, and existing codebases to scale with Solana, which lets dApps take advantage of the best features from both blockchains. Neon EVM offers Ethereum ecosystem dApp developers increased throughput and swift block time on Solana, with low gas prices and no need for changing code – anyone can run Ethereum contracts on Solana with Neon EVM. It also introduces incentivised transactions-facilitating Neon EVM operators to the Solana blockchain. Neon Operator runs Neon Proxy servers, which helps facilitate seamless execution of Ethereum-like transactions on Solana. This allows Ethereum dApps to be ported to Neon with no code change. Neon is here to foster friendship between both communities and chains by adopting the developer tools and compute layer present on Ethereum and reducing friction for Ethereum developers looking to expand to Solana. \n\nNeon EVM ecosystem has numerous projects in its pipeline committed to launching during mainnet and shortly after the launch of mainnet, including blue-chip DeFi protocols, wallets, fiat on/off ramps, infrastructure, DAO tooling, etc.\n\n\nCommitted to support our ecosystem builders and see them succeed, Neon Foundation will provide following support levels that include but are not limited to:\nEcosystem Grants (Application/Approval based)\nAmbassador Program (Application/Approval based)\nBounty Program (Application/Approval based)\nEcosystem Funds (Application/Approval based)\n\n\nNeon EVM is a trustless and open-source project, which will be governed by DAO and Neon Foundation is committed to ethos of decentralisation and community ownership. As we are paving the path towards the open economy, it is highly imperative to have trusted and established lending & borrowing protocols such as Aave within our ecosystem. We believe that Neon-Aave integration will provide users with more choices, enable users to tap into distinct ecosystems from both sides and contribute to the expansion of Web3 economy. \n\n\nDeploying on Neon EVM will onboard new users & increase user activity on Aave by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum, taking advantage of Solana’s throughput, and enabling users to tap into Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. Neon EVM has a robust and surging DeFi ecosystem with distinct players such as AMMs, lending & borrowing protocols, derivatives etc. Having a flagship protocol like Aave would be highly valuable to our ecosystem; since we both share similar values when it comes to decentralisation and community ownership. \n\n\nNeon EVM is highly open to work together with the Aave community to determine optimal strategies for liquidity incentivisation, marketing, awareness campaigns, technical support and additional benefits that are tremendously important for both communities. \n\n\nThe Neon Foundation team would like to take this opportunity and thank the Aave community for granting us the opportunity to make this proposal and we look forward to onboarding Aave to the Neon EVM ecosystem and building a long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationship.\n",

An open-source Layer 1 chain launched under the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  umbrella, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp (Web3) user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos, the majority via a centralized exchange. Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project: as [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  customers, as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem, and/or as [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  project supporters. These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3. For them, Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of self-custody, Ethereum and DeFi.\n\nThe cross-chain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3, resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users. Therefore, Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3.\n\n**Technical specifications of the network**\n\n*Network specifications*\n\n[Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/)  is an open-source project launched by  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  that brings together many  [open-source initiatives](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/blob/main/go.mod#L22)  of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).\n\nCronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called  [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/charts)  , as well as on  [Defillama for TVL data](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos)  .\n\nAt the protocol level, Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validator’s voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocol’s staking token. There are currently 26 live validators, with room for more. The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds, low transaction fees (usually below 1 USD) paid in CRO token, and small environmental footprint.\n\nUsers and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSON-RPC  [endpoints](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  . They can deploy any EVM-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, and can use all the usual end-user and developer tooling: MetaMask, Etherscan block explorer ([Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/) ), Gnosis Safe, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.\n\nThe Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations, specifically the Chainlink oracle, The Graph indexer, and commercial and JSON-RPC endpoints for Dapps (in addition to the existing  [free ones](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  ). These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project. A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022. Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects.\n\nThere are several bridges between Cronos and other networks :\n\n* [Live] Fast withdrawals from and to the  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  app and exchange.\n* [Upcoming] Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology, currently in testing and planned for imminent launch.\n* [Live] IBC transfers from and to the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  chain, Cosmos Hub, and Terra, with more IBC-compatible chains on the roadmap.\n* [Live] EVM smart contract-based transfers from and to BSC, Polygon, and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges, with more to come.\n* Security review of additional bridges is under way.\n\nCronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  [contributors](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  ,  [validators](https://cronos.crypto.org/partners)  , and  [Dapp developers](https://cronos.crypto.org/ecosystem)  . This includes 2 large AMM/DEXes, VVS Finance (1.4 B$ TVL) and MM Finance (320 M$ TVL).\n\nThe  [roadmap](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254)  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations, further connectivity and interoperability, best-in-class tooling and infrastructure, further protocol governance decentralization, dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps, and longer term plans to increase scalability.\n\n*Aave V3 implementation*\n\nAs part of this proposal, Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol, given that Cronos is fully EVM-compatible. Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer (implementation under way).\n\nThe Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVM-based cross-chain bridges (such as Connext and others, subject to further testing and security review) for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens.\n\n*Metrics and references*\n\nChain data as of Feb 15, 2022:\n* 26 live validators.\n* 15+ M transactions to date (no transaction pumping!)\n* 150,000 to 200,000 transactions per day, with potential to increase by 5x to 20x in the short term.\n* 350,000 unique wallets.\n* More than 120 Dapps deployed in the last 3 months, including VVS (DEX, 1.4 B$ TVL), MM Finance (DEX, 320 M$ TVL), Tectonic (decentralized lending, 275 M$ TVL), and others.\n\nAudience data\n*  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cronos_chain)  : 130k followers.\n*  [Telegram](https://t.me/Cryptoorg_Chain_Announcements)  : 7k subscribers.\n*  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pahqHz26q4)  : 19,000 members.\n\nLinks\n*  [Cronos website](https://cronos.crypto.org/) \n*  [Particle B ecosystem development program](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-ecosystem-grants-7a4a2de3b721) \n*  [Blockchain explorer](https://cronoscan.com/) \n*  [Particle B accelerator](https://www.particleb.com/) \n*  [Cronos integration documentation](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html) \n*  [Github](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  repository\n*  [Overview of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/nodes/)  node architecture\n\n**Proposed list of initial collaterals**\n\nThe proposed list of initial collaterals is: CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, ATOM, LUNA, DOT.\n\nAs indicated above, Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment.\n\nCronos already supports the  [following cross-chain assets](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#integration-guide-for-cronos-mainnet-beta)  : CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, SHIB, DOGE, ATOM, LINK, ENJ, ELON, TUSD, LUNA, DOT, BIFI, with more to come. Additional native tokens include VVS, TONIC. These tokens have between 10 M$ and 700 M$ of liquidity on Cronos. Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M$.\n\nThe proposed tokens have more than, or close to, 2 M$ daily volume each. With respect to DEX statistics, see  [VVS analytics](https://vvs.finance/info)  for history and liquidity per token.\n\n**Incentives**\n\nParticle B, the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain, has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development. A portion of these funds will be allocated to end-user incentives, commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos.\n\nIn our experience, the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions, hence the exact programs and amounts (expected to be worth several M$) will need to be refined over time.\n\n**Audits and security**\n\nCronos mainnet was launched in November 2021 and has not experienced outages so far.\n\nAn audit of relevant components of the underlying Ethermint codebase (  [crypto](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/crypto)  ,  [JSON RPC](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/ethereum/rpc)  ,  [Ante handler](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/app)  ,  [EVM state transition](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go)  ) was commissioned by Foris Ltd and completed by Kudelski Security. It is published in the Cronos Github repository ([link](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/tree/main/docs/audit)).\n\nA bug bounty program is  [published](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/)  , with a bounty of up to 1.3 M$.\n\nThank you for your support !",
