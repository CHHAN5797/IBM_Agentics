The sUSDe/USDC pool is 50% yield bearing and will be a core pool.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\n* Website: [Ethena.fi](https://www.ethena.fi/)\n* Documentation: [Ethena documentation](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/)\n* Twitter: [Twitter links](https://twitter.com/ethena_labs/status/1759546702187696437?s=20)\n* [Fundraising news](https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1759546368467849577?s=20)\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nEthena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the ‘Internet Bond’.\n\nEthena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.\n\nUSDe peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral.\n\nsUSDe is the staked version of USDe which earns yield from the protocol.\n\nUSDe has already seen extensive use throughout DeFi, making this an interesting asset to onboard to Balancer.\n\nFor example, liquidity on Curve is already over >100m:\n\n* [https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena ](https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena)\n* [https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank ](https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank)\n* [https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde ](https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde)\n\nUSDe is currently the 4th highest volume asset in the whole of Ethereum behind ETH, USDC, USDT: [Uniswap Interface ](https://app.uniswap.org/explore)\n\n## Motivation:\n\nBalancer is seeking to establish the sUSDe/USDC as a main liquidity source for users wishing to swap sUSDe to USDC and avoid the 7-day delay for unstaking. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Ethena community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nUSDe derives its peg stability from executing automated and programmatic delta-neutral hedges with respect to the underlying collateral assets.\n\nHedging the price change risk of the collateral asset in the same size ensures the change in value of the collateral asset is offset by the change in value of the hedging leg.\n\nThis ensures the synthetic USD value of the collateral remains relatively stable in all market conditions.\n\nConsidering the recent launch of sUSDe and current scaling plans, further proposals will suggest conservative LTVs and borrow caps in order to thoughtfully scale sUSDe as collateral.\n\n## Key Information\n\n* Users are able to acquire USDe in permissionless external liquidity pools.\n* Approved parties from permitted jurisdictions who pass KYC/KYB screening are able to mint & redeem USDe on-demand with Ethena Labs contracts directly which will include only market making entities.\n* There is no reliance upon traditional banking infrastructure as trustless collateral is held and stored within the crypto-system. USDe is fully backed by users’ deposits at all times.\n* Users are also able to complete Cross Market Arbitrage by minting & redeeming USDe with Ethena and trading USDe in external markets such as Binance or Curve pools to capture price dislocations.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe protocol is exposed to various risks including but not limited to:\n\n* Smart Contract Risk\n* External Platform Risk\n* Liquidity Risk\n* Custodial Operational Risk\n* Exchange Counterparty Risk\n* Market Risk\n\n## Governance:\n\nEthena currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to shards holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n## Oracles:\n\nThe Ethena system is split between onchain and offchain components. It does not use any onchain oracles at the moment as all pricing is external to onchain price fees with centralized perpetual markets, but we do use extensive offchain data sources from multiple providers.\n\nEthena Labs relies on price feeds in order to price the mint and redeem USDe requests per the available derivatives market liquidity as well as manage the risk of our derivatives positions. Real-time data feeds indicate not only where it delegates collateral, but the various risk profiles between the exchanges.\n\nWith this in mind, it's critically important that Ethena has access to & is constantly consuming real-time price feeds, especially from where it matters most; the exchanges where it holds derivatives positions due to their margin requirements.\n\nEthena consumes real-time pricing information from three primary sources:\n\n* CeFi Exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Okx, Deribit, Bitmex and Bitget.\n* Pyth.\n* Redstone\n\nThis real-time data is used extensively throughout the system to apply business logic, but to also ensure the integrity of all actions.\n\n## Audits:\n\nEthena has undertaken a multi-phased audit program to ensure the highest level of security on the procotol.\n\n* Phase 1: conducted initial audit with Zellic on the v1 of the protocol where no critical or high level vulnerabilities were found.\n* Phase 2: architecture design review and economic risk factor analysis with Spearbit's Kurt Barry former Lead Engineer at MakerDAO\n* Phase 3: phased audit with industry leading firms:\n  * Quantstamp\n  * Spearbit & Cantina\n* Phase 4: independent audit with Pashov with individual experience of over 50 audits\n* Phase 5: public audit with Code4rena\n* Phase 6: economic and financial risk audit by Chaos Labs\n* Phase 7: upcoming public bug bounty program with Immunefi\n\nCopies of the audit reports can be found [here](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/resources/audits).\n\n## Centralization vectors:\n\nSee [here](https://ethena.notion.site/Ethena-FAQs-3ccc1437e13343f8b74c0d005e4f5128)\n\nValue: The sUSDe/USDC pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for users wishing to avoid the 7-day unstaking period and instead swap sUSDe direct for USDC.\n\nsUSDe on mainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9d39a5de30e57443bff2a8307a4256c8797a3497\n\nUSDC on mainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\n\nsUSDe/USDC pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xb819feef8f0fcdc268afe14162983a69f6bf179e000000000000000000000689\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC#code)\n\n## Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC\n\ngaugeType(string): Ethereum",

The sUDEe/USDC pool is 50% yield bearing and will be a core pool.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\n* Website: [Ethena.fi](https://www.ethena.fi/)\n* Documentation: [Ethena documentation](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/)\n* Twitter: [Twitter links](https://twitter.com/ethena_labs/status/1759546702187696437?s=20)\n* [Fundraising news](https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1759546368467849577?s=20)\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nEthena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the ‘Internet Bond’.\n\nEthena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.\n\nUSDe peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral.\n\nsUSDe is the staked version of USDe which earns yield from the protocol.\n\nUSDe has already seen extensive use throughout DeFi, making this an interesting asset to onboard to Balancer.\n\nFor example, liquidity on Curve is already over >100m:\n\n* [https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena ](https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena)\n* [https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank ](https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank)\n* [https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde ](https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde)\n\nUSDe is currently the 4th highest volume asset in the whole of Ethereum behind ETH, USDC, USDT: [Uniswap Interface ](https://app.uniswap.org/explore)\n\n## Motivation:\n\nEthena is seeking to establish the sUSDe/USDC and USDe/USDC pools on Arbitrum as its main liquidity sources to further enrich liquidity for sUSDe and USDe. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Ethena community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nUSDe derives its peg stability from executing automated and programmatic delta-neutral hedges with respect to the underlying collateral assets.\n\nHedging the price change risk of the collateral asset in the same size ensures the change in value of the collateral asset is offset by the change in value of the hedging leg.\n\nThis ensures the synthetic USD value of the collateral remains relatively stable in all market conditions.\n\nConsidering the recent launch of sUSDe and current scaling plans, further proposals will suggest conservative LTVs and borrow caps in order to thoughtfully scale sUSDe as collateral.\n\n## Key Information\n\n* Users are able to acquire USDe in permissionless external liquidity pools.\n* Approved parties from permitted jurisdictions who pass KYC/KYB screening are able to mint & redeem USDe on-demand with Ethena Labs contracts directly which will include only market making entities.\n* There is no reliance upon traditional banking infrastructure as trustless collateral is held and stored within the crypto-system. USDe is fully backed by users’ deposits at all times.\n* Users are also able to complete Cross Market Arbitrage by minting & redeeming USDe with Ethena and trading USDe in external markets such as Binance or Curve pools to capture price dislocations.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe protocol is exposed to various risks including but not limited to:\n\n* Smart Contract Risk\n* External Platform Risk\n* Liquidity Risk\n* Custodial Operational Risk\n* Exchange Counterparty Risk\n* Market Risk\n\n## Governance:\n\nEthena currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to shards holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n## Oracles:\n\nThe Ethena system is split between onchain and offchain components. It does not use any onchain oracles at the moment as all pricing is external to onchain price fees with centralized perpetual markets, but we do use extensive offchain data sources from multiple providers.\n\nEthena Labs relies on price feeds in order to price the mint and redeem USDe requests per the available derivatives market liquidity as well as manage the risk of our derivatives positions. Real-time data feeds indicate not only where it delegates collateral, but the various risk profiles between the exchanges.\n\nWith this in mind, it's critically important that Ethena has access to & is constantly consuming real-time price feeds, especially from where it matters most; the exchanges where it holds derivatives positions due to their margin requirements.\n\nEthena consumes real-time pricing information from three primary sources:\n\n* CeFi Exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Okx, Deribit, Bitmex and Bitget.\n* Pyth.\n* Redstone\n\nThis real-time data is used extensively throughout the system to apply business logic, but to also ensure the integrity of all actions.\n\n## Audits:\n\nEthena has undertaken a multi-phased audit program to ensure the highest level of security on the procotol.\n\n* Phase 1: conducted initial audit with Zellic on the v1 of the protocol where no critical or high level vulnerabilities were found.\n* Phase 2: architecture design review and economic risk factor analysis with Spearbit's Kurt Barry former Lead Engineer at MakerDAO\n* Phase 3: phased audit with industry leading firms:\n  * Quantstamp\n  * Spearbit & Cantina\n* Phase 4: independent audit with Pashov with individual experience of over 50 audits\n* Phase 5: public audit with Code4rena\n* Phase 6: economic and financial risk audit by Chaos Labs\n* Phase 7: upcoming public bug bounty program with Immunefi\n\nCopies of the audit reports can be found [here](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/resources/audits).\n\n## Centralization vectors:\n\nSee [here](https://ethena.notion.site/Ethena-FAQs-3ccc1437e13343f8b74c0d005e4f5128)\n\n## Value: \n\nThe sUSDe/USDC and USDe/USDC pools on Balancer are intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the tokens on Arbitrum.\n\n## Specifications\nsUSDe on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x211cc4dd073734da055fbf44a2b4667d5e5fe5d2\n\nUSDe on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5d3a1ff2b6bab83b63cd9ad0787074081a52ef34\n\nsUSDe/USDC Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x2f0cdf8596be980ef24924ca7bf54e630ca526b2000000000000000000000529\n\nChild chain gauge [0xE9801a0FA08acF9140bA3a347A8c6048fF9Eab7C](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xE9801a0FA08acF9140bA3a347A8c6048fF9Eab7C)\nMainnet root: [0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778)\n\nUSDe/USDC Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x537d8ef9e6e0adfb099cb14aeaf04ebeffaf444c000000000000000000000528\n\nChild chain gauge: [0xc76bCF2221a1Be984FeA73E12429302AfC70feb2](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc76bCF2221a1Be984FeA73E12429302AfC70feb2#readContract)\nMainnet root: [0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c)\n\nsUSDe/USDe Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x02a1e9f29e9a04dbb64114e78cb6cba20c22d73f00000000000000000000052a\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x64B57375a5DD480280cc0513B20e380f1649545c](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x64B57375a5DD480280cc0513B20e380f1649545c)\nMainnet root: [0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493)\n\nsUSDe/sFRAX Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x59743f1812bb85db83e9e4ee061d124aaa64290000000000000000000000052b\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x4b8858a8E42f406B4dC2eCB8D48B5cf0021035c8](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4b8858a8E42f406B4dC2eCB8D48B5cf0021035c8)\nMainnet root: [0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE)\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **GYD is an all-weather stablecoin that provides one-stop access to stablecoin risk control.** GYD is fully backed by a set of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level to automate diversification and redundancy.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.\n\n> # References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n> # Protocol description\n> \n> * GYD is an all-weather stablecoin that provides one-stop access to stablecoin risk control. GYD is fully backed by a set of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level to automate diversification and redundancy.\n> \n>   These innovations include automated risk diversification rules, optimized minting and redemption design that guides the protocol on how to use reserve assets to maintain stability, and multiple layers of redundancy in price feeds and circuit breakers.\n> \n>   Note, GYD replaces p-GYD, which is a prototype version of GYD on Polygon that was in testing for ~9 months. - [Gyroscope](https://gyro.finance/)\n> \n> * All Tether tokens (USD₮) are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves. - [Tether](https://tether.to/en/)\n> * USDC is a digital dollar, also known as a stablecoin, that’s available 24/7 and moves at internet speed. USDC lives natively on the internet, running on many of the world’s most advanced blockchains. Billions of USDC change hands every day1, and every digital dollar of USDC is always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. - [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)\n> * Dai is a stable, decentralized currency that does not discriminate. Any individual or business can realize the advantages of digital money. - [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/)\n> * sDAI is a tokenized wrapper, passing on the DSR. - [MakerDAO](https://github.com/makerdao/sdai)\n\n> # Motivation\n> \n> The capital efficiency of E-CLPs will help to quickly bootstrap a liquidity network for GYD. This hub-and-spoke network will enable a liquid secondary market for GYD to make it easier to exit from/ enter into GYD.\n> \n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n> \n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n\n> # Specifications\n> \n> > ## Governance\n> > \n> > The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n> \n> > ## Oracles\n> > \n> > *GYD/ sDAI*:\n> > * rateProvider0 (for GYD): 0x00\n> > * rateProvider1 (for sDAI): 0xc7177B6E18c1Abd725F5b75792e5F7A3bA5DBC2c\n> > * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n> > \n> > *GYD/ USDC*: no rate providers are used\n> > \n> > *GYD/USDT*: no rate providers are used\n> \n> > ## Audits\n> > \n> > Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports).
