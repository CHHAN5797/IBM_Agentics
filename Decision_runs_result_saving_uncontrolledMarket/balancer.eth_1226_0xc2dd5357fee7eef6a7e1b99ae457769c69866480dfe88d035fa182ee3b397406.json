Trident Digital aims to scale stable coin adoption both within and outside the crypto market through strong relationships and experience navigating both the crypto and traditional finance markets. Our previous on-chain work includes facilitation of incentives for the [USDP-PSM](https://messari.io/governor/proposal/57b2db7d-7505-4190-9696-ac2c344e46a2).\n>\n> While the pyUSD/GHO pool currently holds no funds Trident Digital is working with partners to provide deep liquidity to the pool in the very near future.\n>\n>## Motivation\n>\n>This proposal aims to add one new veBAL gauge.\n>\n>GHO/pyUSD E-CLP - Range: -80bps to 50bps\n\n>## Specification\n>\n>1. **Governance:** \n>\n>* AAVE, aAAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO. Holders can vote on proposals at both a Snapshot level and through the Aave DAO [on-chain governance portal](https://app.aave.com/governance/). \n>\n>2. **Oracles:**\n>\n>No rate providers are used.\n>\n>* rateProvider0 (for GHO): 0x0 (none)\n>* rateProvider1 (for pyUSD): 0x0 (none)\n>\n>3. **Audits:**\n>\n>*Aave v3*\n>* [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin ](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [Peckshield](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [SigmaPrime](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3.pdf)\n>\n>*GHO*\n>* [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/02-06-2023_SigmaPrime.pdf)\n>* [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/07-03-2023_SigmaPrime.pdf)\n>* [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/01-03-2023_ABDK.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin-v2](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/10-11-2022_Openzeppelin-v2.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin-v1](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/12-08-2022_Openzeppelin-v1.pdf)\n>\n> *pyUSD*\n> * [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract/blob/master/audit-reports/Trail_of_Bits_Audit_Report.pdf)\n> * [Historical database of monthly attestations](https://paxos.com/pyusd-transparency/)\n> \n>On the off-chain side Paxos works with [Withum](https://www.withum.com/), a nationally-ranked audit firm, in order to provide timely monthly attestations of reserves backing pyUSD.\n>\n>4. **Centralization vectors:** \n>* Aave Governance is decentralized, and all changes must go through a transparent and well-tested governance process.\n>\n>* Paxos is a centralized entity functioning in a similar way to Circle, the issuer of USDC. There is no governance structure outside of that dictated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\n>\n>* All pyUSD is issued 1:1 against funds held in either cash or US Government Treasuries. All funds backing pyUSD are held bankruptcy remote with New York Banking laws protecting customer funds from being used to satisfy any debt of Paxos.\n>\n>* The E-CLP Pool type, the FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n>\n>5. **Market History:** \n>* [GHO](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)\n>* [pyUSD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/paypal-usd)\n>\n>6. **Value:**\n>* This pool is expected to drive meaningful TVL to Balancer and Aura Finance. The assets within the pool are not yield bearing. However, the DAOs will generate revenue from receiving a portion of the swap fees.\n\n>## Pool Details\n>Link to Pool: GHO/pyUSD Pool - Range: -80bps to 50bps - [0x4c4Ed61D81F531Dcb34Ad4d498548917ABA3D193](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x4c4ed61d81f531dcb34ad4d498548917aba3d193000200000000000000000680)\n>Link to Gauges: B-GHO-pyUSD - [0xb71C90F165cf99d4004499fF058E265Aa68fAC85](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb71C90F165cf99d4004499fF058E265Aa68fAC85) \n>\n>Transaction: Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xb71C90F165cf99d4004499fF058E265Aa68fAC85`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\n>## Disclosure\n>\n>This proposal is the work of Tokenlogic and karpatkey who are both Service Providers and delegates within the Aave Ecosystem.",

This gauge is uncapped, and would enter as a “core pool” under [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329). This means 65% of 50% of yield generated by this pool is to be used for bribing for votes on it via [Hidden Hand](https://hiddenhand.finance/balancer). The remaining 35% goes to Balancer DAO as revenue. \n>\n>This proposal is for a new pool wstETH/GHO to be created on Ethereum.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n>*GHO*\n>* [Website](https://app.aave.com/markets/)\n>* [Documentation](https://docs.aave.com/hub/)\n>* [Github Page](https://github.com/aave/interface)\n>* [Communities](https://governance.aave.com/)\n>\n>*wstETH*\n>* [Website](https://stake.lido.fi/)\n>* [Documentation](https://blog.lido.fi/)\n>* [Github Page](https://github.com/lidofinance)\n>* [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n>*Aave Protocol*\nThe Aave Protocol is a decentralized liquidity protocol that is deployed across many EVM compatible networks including but not limited to Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche and Polygon. Currently, the Aave Protocol has a TVL of approximately $7.8 Billion.\n>\n>GHO is a decentralized multi-collateral stable coin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol. \n>\n> *Lido Protocol*\n> stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido Protocol. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day.\n> \n> wstETH is a wrapped version of regular stETH, while wETH is a wrapped version of Ethereum.\n>\n**Motivation:**\n\n> This proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for 80wstETH-20GHO.\n>\n>One of Balancer’s near term strategic objectives is to attract more yield bearing liquidity and more GHO liquidity pools to Balancer.
