Although some users will be eligible to withdraw GHO before the GSM is funded, the GSM is intended to be funded before some of the later holdings exit cool down. \n\n| SM Category | Size | Cool Down Date |\n| :---:       | :---:| :---:          |\n| stkGHO      | 1.4M |  06/05/2024    |\n| stkGHO      | 3.0M |  08/05/2024    |\n| stkGHO      | 0.9M |  10/05/2024    |\n| stkGHO      | 2.4M |  19/05/2024    |\n\nSource: [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/queries/2816986/4697667)\n\nWith the introduction of the Merit rewards expected to be included in the Aave Protocol frontend very soon and AAVE emissions flowing to depositors, we expect several of these addresses will recommit to holding GHO within the SM. \n\n# Specification\n\nTwo Allowances are to be created enabling the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) to draw 1M USDC and 1M USDT from Aave v3.\n\nWhen market conditions are optimal, the ALC will fund the USDC and USDT GSMs.\n\nDo note the GSMs are currently configured to receive a maximum of 500k USDC and 500k of USDT. The additional USDC and USDT will be drawn down by the ALC when GHO Stewards determine those funds are needed at each respective GSM.\n\nALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n| Asset | Asset| GSM Address |\n| :---: | :---:| :---:|\n| USDT  | 1M   | `0x686F8D21520f4ecEc7ba577be08354F4d1EB8262` |\n| USDC  | 1M   | `0x0d8eFfC11dF3F229AA1EA0509BC9DFa632A13578` |\n\nThe resulting GHO is to be kept in the ALC until its future use is dictated by governance.\n\nThis proposal will route via Snapshot before being submitted to AIP. \n\nFuture GSM related proposals, such as this one, are to be implemented via the Direct-to-AIP process.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, ACI and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Safety Module stkGHO - Rewards Adjustment\nAuthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\nCreated: 2024-04-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes replacing the AAVE emissions to stkGHO holders within the Safetey Module (SM) with GHO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stkGHO category within the SM currently holds 21.43M units of GHO and receives 100 AAVE/day. This is equivalent to 36,500 units of AAVE emissions per year worth an estimated $3,394,500 at an AAVE price of $93.00/unit. The current annualised accrued GHO revenue, with 50M units of supply and Borrow Rate of [12.26%](https://dune.com/queries/3206348/5447167) is 6.13M. The Aave DAO's GHO revenue is sufficient to replace the AAVE emissions to stkGHO holders and meaningfully contribute to offsetting other DAO expenses like [Merit](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-is-forever-reward-system-program-extension/17336). \n\nWith a bullish GHO revenue outlook, migrating stkGHO holders' rewards from AAVE to GHO is a positive step forward for Aave DAO. As a direct result of this proposed change, the AAVE Emissions runway is extended by 13.89%. After a successful migration of stkGHO rewards to GHO, other Safety Modules can be evaluated for similar adjustments. In particular, stkBPT would make a good candidate once GHO supply is large enough to cover the corresponding $AAVE emissions.\n\n\nGiven the recent price action in the AAVE price and the resulting lower yield on the stkGHO category, this publication propose a 20% yield on current GHO deposits. This is equivalent to 4.33M annualised, 11,850 daily GHO spend on the stkGHO category. The reward rate will be periodically reviewed to ensure targets on supply and APR vary within reasonable ranges. In order to reduce governance burden, this post additionally proposes to pursuit future updates with direct-to-AIP proposals.\n\nDetails on GHO Revenue can be found on [TokenLogic's GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/gho-revenue).\n\nLonger term, we envisage migrating from fixed daily GHO emissions to GHO emissions to stkGHO holders being a function of the DAO's GHO nominated revenue. This publication represents the initial step of transitioning from AAVE to GHO, and then later to a more revenue correlated emission schedule. \n\n# Specification\n\nUpdate SM Category 3 - stkGHO as per the below:\n\n| Parameter                    |  Current | Proposed  |\n|    ---                       | :---:    | :---:     |\n| Reward Type (Token)          | AAVE     | GHO       |\n| Deposits (Current/Target)    | 21.43M   | 21.43M    |\n| Daily Withdrawal Limit (GHO) | 2.5M     | 2.5M      |\n| Daily Reward Amount (Units)  | 100.00   | 11,850.00 |\n| APR (%)                      | 15.84    | 20.00     |\n| Slashing (%)                 | 100.00   | 100.00    |\n| Emission Duration (Days)     | NA       | 180.00    |\n\nEnable future updates on GHO Emissions to the stkGHO Safety Module through direct-to-AIP proposals.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "**Title:** [ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO\n\n**Author:** Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n**Date:** 2023-11-21\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC introduces an enhancement to the Safety Module by integrating a GHO Safety Module. This new category aims to mitigate risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events within its ecosystem. It also reduces the Safety incentives for StkAAVE and StkBPT.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[AIP-366 was adopted by governance](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/366/) to reduce the safety incentives of StkAAVE and StkBPT, but an implementation bug made the AIP execution impossible. After discussion with DAO service providers, it was decided to bundle the re-run of 366 with the creation of the GHO safety module and the StkGHO asset.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will fortify the Aave Protocol's resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversifies the Safety Module's capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will target a liquidity pool of 9M GHO with an APR range of 12-15%, achievable with a daily emission of 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day period. The module will have a slashing rate set at 100%, meaning the entirety of the deposits could be utilized in a shortfall event, with socialized coverage among StkGHO holders. The cooldown period is adjusted to 10 days, which is suitable for a stablecoin.\n\n## Specification\n**Revised Safety Module Emissions Rate:**\n\n| Asset      | Previous Emissions | Proposed Emissions |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| StkAAVE    | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkBPT     | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkGHO     | N/A               | 35 AAVE/day        |\n\n- **GHO Safety Module Parameters:**\n  - Target Liquidity: 9M GHO\n  - Target APR: 12-15%\n  - Emissions Period: 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day cycle\n  - Slashing Rate: 100%\n  - Cooldown Period: 10 days\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and has not been compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).\n\nWhile some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.\n\nConcentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. \n\nThe following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:\n\n* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume \n    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period\n    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility \n*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP\n    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced\n* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks\n    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiex2m345ibzurmui7f3vz7l5w23sv53ej6fj5tppcqcphfsf3p2l4)\nSource: [karpatkey - Dune Analytics - ](https://dune.com/karpatkey/gho-debt-and-token-metrics)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreib2sefybdb73e7g4wksg7mk5wlj3ul53plmw3hrpbmpltn3wlxzu4)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-pools)\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiabucrlngizdmx25lzi23uorxsgkzoxm6da7tksdmhnw7cbpqqvue)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-committee)\n\nThe next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:\n\n* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD \n* Reducing price volatility\n* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations\n* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools\n* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases\n\nThese efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). \n\nThough there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:\n\n| Objective | Category | Budget   |\n| --------  | --------  | -------- |\n| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |\n| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |\n|Total| | 500k GHO|\n\nIt is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Performance Indicators\n\nThe below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:\n\n| Description| Optimal Value|\n| --------  | --------  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |\n| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\nThe [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. \n\nEach of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.\n\n# Specification\n\nSwap the following assets for GHO:\n\n* 250k aUSDT\n* 250k aUSDC\n\nCreate an allowance for 500k GHO.\n\nALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n1. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
