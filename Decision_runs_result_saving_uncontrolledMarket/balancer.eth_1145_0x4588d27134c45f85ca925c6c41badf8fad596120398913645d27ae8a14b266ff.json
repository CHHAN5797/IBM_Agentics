        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the funding of the Balancer Foundation for year three.\n\nAs a recap, the Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work in a decentralized environment, and supports resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate. It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts, and is able to take certain actions that a DAO is unable to perform on its own behalf.\n\nThe Foundation and its operating subsidiary (Balancer OpCo Limited) act as facilitators of the Balancer Ecosystem. This governance structure, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, the front-end team or other technology providers.\n\nIn short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the DAO and part of the DAO’s governance within the structure of the traditional business world.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.\n\n# Specification - Foundation expenses and reserves\n\nThe budget identified for the Foundation is line-item specific and includes very few estimates. The Foundation has, however, assisted in achieving meaningful savings elsewhere in the ecosystem, mainly by optimizing costs across many different service providers.\n\nThe Foundation’s independent Cayman director reviewed these projections in comparison with a number of foundations similar portfolio to the Balancer Foundation, and sees the Balancer Foundation achieving a material cost saving overall with its proposed figures.\n\nThis proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2024 running through March 2025. This proposal does not request any change to the self-insurance reserve, currently covered by the approval of [BIP-198](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409).\n\n## Foundation Expenses\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, and introduces a few changes to our Cayman/BVI structure without compromising our footprint in these jurisdictions, significantly reducing our USDC burn.\n\nThe current CEO (Tristan Relly) has given notice and the Foundation Board, with support from team leaders in the Ecosystem-Council, has identified @Danko8383 to perform the operational and administrative roles for both the Foundation and Balancer OpCo, deprecating the “CEO” title.\n\nDanko is a seasoned Balancer community member, part of the Balancer Maxis and has been a Director on the Foundation Board since Dec 2022. From Q2 and beyond, this proposal would also see other daily operational duties of the DAO (currently held from within the Maxis) move into the Foundation/OpCo setup, reallocating this scope of work (see more on the Maxis funding proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2024/5625));\n\nIn order to replace Tristan Relly’s signing authority in the Cayman Islands, the board has carried out discussions with independent directors based in the Cayman Islands, and would like to propose that the Foundation retain the services of an additional professional director provided by Leeward Management Limited (“Leeward”) that is being offered at a competitive price. The budget includes an element of operational and legal support for the Foundation on a monthly basis. Leeward and their personnel are drawn from recognized industry professions, are experienced in governance and compliance matters for Cayman Islands foundation companies, and act for many leading projects and some of the largest DAOs. This particular candidate has a legal background that will be useful to the Foundation well in reviewing legal contracts.\n\nThe Foundation Board proposes that the appointment is effective immediately on the conclusion of voting should the proposal pass. According to article 5.3 of Balancer’s Foundation Articles of Association: “The Token Holders have the power, by Governance Resolution, to appoint or remove Directors.”\n\nBoard meetings held on-site in the Cayman Islands are also accounted for in the budget, given last epoch’s were paid from savings. The meetings with a totality/majority of the members present are considered a great advantage for jurisdictional substance.\n\nIf approved, we propose that year three be funded from funds already held by Balancer OpCo due to savings achieved there, rather than additional funding from the DAO. If budget changes are requested, they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.\n\nThe Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, and one will see annual fees due around December/January that lead to higher funding needs in those quarters. The year two budget accounted for two years worth of annual fees and professional director's fees due to the timing of payments. That was a one-off and now the budget aligns with those payments once a year.\n\n \n![bip-566-1.png](ipfs://bafybeih7eugdbewp5tvybhddvtezyere76nouepmyjznssklxuqrggncqm)\n    \n\n# Detail\n\nFor reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.\n\n### Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)\n\nAnnual registered office and registrar fee (US$3,207.00). These fees are due in January each year and are based on current figures, with a 10% uplift. Includes:\n\n- providing the registered office and registered agent\n- maintaining the statutory registers\n- preparation and submission of annual returns\n- filing economic substance notifications\n- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same\n\n### Annual Secretary Fee\n\nUnder Cayman Law, a Foundation Company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). These fees are due in January each year and are based on current figures, with a 10% uplift.\n\nNeither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise (see “Legal Counsel” below).\n\n### Legal Counsel\n\nThe Foundation may seek counsel on matters of Cayman law and industry standards as they evolve. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to an additional Cayman legal team rather than the in-house service team.\n\nAny additional corporate requests (e.g. requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc) are here included as a buffer and will also be charged separately.\n\nTentatively, if the budget is available, the Foundation will seek counsel regarding MiCA developments in Europe and tax legislation, focusing on U.S. fiscal and regulatory overreach.\n\n### Governance/Supervisory Services\n\n#### Director and Supervisor Responsibilities\n\nUnder the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.\n\n“Supervisor”, for a Foundation Company, means a person, other than a member, who under the Foundation Company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.\n\nThe non-executive Director responsibilities are:\n\n* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors\n* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation\n* To work with the wider board of directors to:\n  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;\n  * set an agenda for board meetings;\n  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate\n* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate\n* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission\n* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary\n* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director\n\nThe contracted fees for these services are in line with industry standard, and less than certain providers. The fees are due in full in January each year.\n\nIn this present proposal, as presented above, the Foundation is budgeting for the appointment of a 4th Director to the board in replacement to Tristan Relly, allocating a maximum of 5 hours/mo (hourly charges incurred per hour capped), which should be sufficient for the Board needs.\n\n#### Community Board Member duties\n\nThe Directors have ultimate responsibility for the oversight of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:\n\n* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require\n\n* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;\n\n* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;\n\n* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;\n\nThe contracted fees for these services are in line with industry standard, and less than certain providers. The fees are due quarterly.\n\n#### Operational and administrative duties\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is currently responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation.\n\nFrom Q2/24, the Foundation Board has identified these responsibilities to be handed over to @Danko as a service provider for operations and administration at the direction of the board, accumulating other ecosystem-wide domains of operations, currently under the scope of the [Balancer Maxis](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420), taking the Ballers (community contributor) inside the OpCo subsidiary.\n\nThe cost-center shift will see an increase in Danko’s monthly compensation due to increased responsibilities, specially being a go-to signatory for the Foundation/OpCo while also acting behalf of the DAO, carrying a portion of his locked BAL package (1.2k BAL/quarter). Danko is a seasoned Balancer community member, having support from team leaders in the ecosystem-council to take on this responsibility (see detailed below). The changes introduced here and other restructuring proposals, account for most of the introduced cost savings to the DAO as a whole, reducing the Treasury’s burn rate.\n\nThe handover role of day-to-day management currently carried by the Foundation’s CEO (to be deprecated), includes:\n\n1. Liaising with the board on budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary\n* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, program operations, employee matters,\n* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance regarding the carrying out of the Foundation’s purpose under its Memorandum and Articles.\n\n2. Manage Finances and Service Providers\n\n* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.\n* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.\n* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord).\n* Contracts with BVI for service providers.\n* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account\n* Setting up and managing token custodian for the Foundation\n* As directed, overseeing vendors as needed.\n\n3. Compliance\n\n* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters.\n\n4. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.\n\nUnder the Balancer Maxis, Danko is carrying the following domains and tasks with the assistance of the Ballers:\n\n5. Community Engagement\n\n* Managing community interactions\n* Onboarding new contributors and service providers\n* Planning ecosystem meetups and events (ONsites) and handling logistical arrangements\n* Discord user support\n* Balancer weekly report (newsletter)\n* Governance report (Twitter)\n\n6. DAO Treasury and Risk Management\n\n* Overseeing budget, payments, and financial transactions.\n* Due diligence for new service providers.\n* Risk inventory and assessment with GRC\n\n7. Outreach and Anti-Scam Oversight\n\n* Leading efforts against scam activities within the Balancer ecosystem.\n* Pen-testing of security infrastructure\n* Take down of scam sites\n* Services and subscriptions admin (Discord, Notion, etc.).\n\nSee the supplementary budget proposal for the Ballers at the Balancer OpCo [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628).\n\n## Software, hosting, admin\n\nExpenses for day to day operations, including payment processor fee (crypto credit card, off-ramp solutions, banks etc.) and accounting software for bookkeeping (Xero)\n\n# Impact on the Treasury\n\nBalancer Foundation/OpCo holds enough USDC and BAL to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by SPs v. their original budgets. For that reason, no token transfer is required from the DAO for this proposal.\n\nThe table below summarizes where costs were previously budgeted, and where they are now being proposed. In addition, the changes proposed by the restructuring will introduce $76,716 USD annualized net savings to the DAO (based on current projections):\n\n \n![bip-566-2.png](ipfs://bafkreigrwznk3blqr7kaqwwfuwcyt7kwwzgabfl4a55tejcjko5jmifnry)\n    \n\n## ETH Address to Receive Funds:\n\nNot necessary as this proposal can be covered by funds currently held at the Balancer OpCo.\n\n## Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this is internal / for the OpCo itself.",

        "body": "*Authored by Tristan, Sean, mkflow, and Xeonus*\n\n# Summary\n\nAs a recap, on 13 April 2022, a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-incorporation-of-the-balancer-foundation/2989) was brought to the BalancerDAO (or the “DAO”) to incorporate the Balancer Foundation (or the “Foundation”). The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate, and provides, among others, two primary benefits:\n\nIt allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts. In addition, for example, it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.\n\nIt encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage business development or tech providers.\n\nIn short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.\n\nRunning a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below, first in summary and then in detail for reference.\n\n## Specification - Foundation Expenses and reserves\n\nThis proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2022 running through March 2023, and a self-insurance reserve.\n\n### Foundation Expenses\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.\n\nThe Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, so April / May /June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested.\n\n1. Q2 FY22 - USDC 32,941 - actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022 - immediate payment requested\n2. Q3 FY22 - USDC 67,919 - for transfer 25 June 2022\n3. Q4 FY22 - USDC 67,969 - for transfer 25 September 2022\n4. Q1 FY23 - USDC 78,384 - for transfer 15 December 2022\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.\n\n![|624x417.174903581549](upload://vPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Ii.jpeg)\n\n### Foundation Self Insurance Reserve\n\nAs part of this proposal, we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US$500,000 as a self-insurance reserve, earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year. The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions, but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed, and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US$500,000. More on this reserve requirement can be found in the “Detail” section below.\n\nNote: the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level, it does not include funding for:\n\n1. Balancer OpCo Limited, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary and operating company that will house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO,\n2. Other third-party service providers to the BalancerDAO, such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs.\n\nProposals for funding these three entities will follow separately.\n\n# ETH Address to Receive Funds: \n0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693\n\n# Detail\n\nFor reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.\n\n## Annual Secretary Fee\n\nUnder Cayman Law, a foundation company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). The secretary has a duty to ensure that the company complies with applicable Cayman Islands legislation governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.\n\nNeither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise.\n\nThese fees are due in January each year.\n\n## Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)\n\nAnnual registered office and registrar fee – US$2,915.12, which consists of:\n\n- Registered Office fee of US$ 1,495.00\n\n- Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Register Maintenance Fee of US$225.00\n\n- Economic Substance Notification Fee of US$125.00\n\n- Registrar Annual Return Fee of US$853.66\n\n- Supplementary Registered Office License Fee of US$91.46\n\n- Sundry Disbursements of US$125.00\n\nIncludes:\n\n- providing the registered office and registered agent\n\n- maintaining the statutory registers\n\n- preparation and submission of annual returns\n\n- filing economic substance notifications\n\n- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same\n\nThese fees are due in January each year.\n\n## Additional Campbells Corporate Services costs\n\nAny legal advice that may be requested from time to time will be charged on a time spent basis. Any additional corporate requests (for example, requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc – these are all in addition to the annual fees) will also be charged separately.\n\n## Governance/Supervisory Services\n\n### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities\n\nUnder the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.\n\n“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.\n\nThe non-executive director responsibilities are:\n\n* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors\n* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation\n* To work with the wider board of directors to:\n  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;\n  * set an agenda for board meetings;\n  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate\n* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate\n* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission\n* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary\n* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director\n* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects\n* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.\n\n### Community Board Member duties\n\nThe Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:\n\n* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require\n\n* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;\n\n* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;\n\n* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;\n\n* planning, developing, and enhancing the future strategic direction of the DAO\n\n* sharing responsibility with the other director(s) of the Company for the effective management of the Company\n\n### CEO/Management duties\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation, which includes the following roles:\n\n1. Liaising with the board on all budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary\n\n* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, policy setting, planning, program operations, employee matters, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.\n* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance.\n\n2.

Contracts with BVI for service providers.\n* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account\n* Setting up and managing token custodian\n\n3. Involving the board, ecosystem participants, service provider staff as needed in developing organizational goals, a strategic plan, and projections for supporting the Balancer mission through service providers (Orb Collective Inc and BVI subsidiary) and the community.\n\n* Overseeing vendors & others involved in actively seeking software and product developments and funds as needed.\n* Ensuring that the Balancer projects delegated to service providers and the ecosystem have clear objectives that are within the scope of the resources and mission of the Foundation.\n* Overseeing the gathering, analysis, and reporting of data illustrating the work accomplished by service providers to manage performance and deliverables\n* Reviewing program evaluation results and developing and executing strategies for continual improvement.\n\n4. Compliance\n\n* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters\n\n5. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.\n\n## Legal Counsel\n\nThe Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team.\n\n## Self Insurance\n\nIt is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal, regulatory and operational risks, as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties. We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market, hence the need to self-insure.\n\nWe are asking for $500,000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry, class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem. The self-insurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average $100,000 monthly to defend. It is important to note, that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages, fines, or impact on users.\n\nSince this is a reserve and not an expense, the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO. We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for self-insurance.\n\n## Bank Fees\n\nThe Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 6-8 weeks once the application is complete and submitted. This line item is an estimate/placeholder for monthly fees\n\n## Accounting Software\n\nEstimate for monthly software subscription fees.\n\n## Domain hosting, email document management solution\n\nMinor operating budget to cover the above and related items.",

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/171)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the funding of the Balancer Foundation for year two. The year one Foundation budget started in FY22 Q2 to account for its earlier incorporation, as a result the renewal falls earlier than most other funding cycles.\n\nAs a recap, the Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work in a decentralized environment, and supports resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate\n\nIt allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts.\n\nThe Foundation and its operating subsidiary act as facilitators of the Balancer Ecosystem. This governance structure, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, the front-end team or other technology providers.\n\nIn short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the DAO and part of the DAO’s governance within the structure of the traditional business world. The Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.\n\nAs we are all aware, running a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below. For more detail, please refer to the initial funding proposal for the Foundation.\n\nThe budget identified for the Foundation is line-item specific and includes very few estimates. The Foundation has, however, assisted in achieving meaningful savings elsewhere in the ecosystem, as shared with the community [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-foundation-and-balancer-opco-cost-update-to-the-balancer-community-march-2023/4556).\n\nThe Foundation’s independent Cayman director reviewed these projections in comparison with a number of foundations similar in nature to the Balancer Foundation, and sees the Balancer Foundation achieving a material cost saving overall with its proposed figures.\n\n## Specification - Foundation expenses and reserves\n\nThis proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2023 running through March 2024. This proposal does not request any change to the self-insurance reserve, currently covered by the approval of [BIP-198](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409).\n\n### Foundation Expenses\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, if approved, we propose that FY23 Q2 be funded from funds already held by Balancer OpCo due to savings achieved there, rather than additional funding from the DAO. Thereafter, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.\n\nThe Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, and one will see annual fees due around December/January that lead to higher funding needs in those quarters. This is the first funding cycle where four full quarters are budgeted. The other proposed changes from the previous budget are: timing of Cayman director fees aligning with the full calendar year per contract terms - this is a reset year and should only happen once; and a slight increase in allowance for legal counsel to deal with certain corporate administration matters and from a budgetary prudence perspective. The Foundation has no BAL requirements.\n\n1. Q2 FY23 - USDC 99,094 - we propose this quarter is funded from existing reserves due to savings at the operating subsidiary.\n2. Q3 FY23 - USDC 59,219 - for transfer 25 June 2023\n3. Q4 FY23 - USDC 69,634 - for transfer 25 September 2023\n4. Q1 FY24 - USDC 105,344 - for transfer 15 December 2023\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter.\n\n \n![foundationYear2.png](ipfs://bafkreifktkexntxvp3wgialmlqjp2vllml7lp57v4pi62ir7jcueb3fjgm)\n    \n\n\n### ETH Address to Receive Funds:\n\n0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693",

        "body": "### Summary\n\nThe Foundation Board would like to propose that the Foundation retain the services of a professional director and supervisor provided by [Leeward Management Limited](https://www.leeward.ky/) (“Leeward”), a Cayman Islands-licensed governance, compliance and corporate services firm to fill a gap in the Board. Leeward and their personnel are drawn from recognized industry professions, are experienced in governance and compliance matters for Cayman Islands foundation companies, and act for many leading projects and some of the largest DAOs.\n\nThe Foundation Board proposes that the appoints are effective immediately on the conclusion of voting should the proposal pass. According to article 5.3 of Balancer’s Foundation Articles of Association: “The Token Holders have the power, by Governance Resolution, to appoint or remove Directors.”\n\n### Motivation\n\nBalancer’s former non-executive director and supervisor has stepped down for reasons unrelated to Balancer. The Foundation directors and management would like to thank them for their guidance and services, which have been a great addition in the early stages of establishing operations and Foundation-level governance.\n\nThe Foundation board has screened a wide group of very capable candidates for the role, and has identified Leeward as the best fit for the current needs of the Foundation. Leeward’s overall fee quote was also the most competitive, and came in slightly lower than prior costs for both roles combined. Fees payable to Leeward under its services agreement will not exceed $40,000 per annum.\n\nAs there will be no overlap of directors, there will be no additional cost to the Balancer DAO and no funds are requested under this proposal.\n\n### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities\n\nUnder the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.\n\n“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.\n\nThe non-executive director responsibilities are:\n\n* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors\n* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation\n* To work with the wider board of directors to:\n  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;\n  * set an agenda for board meetings;\n  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate\n* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate\n* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission\n* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary\n* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director\n* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects\n* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.",

        "body": "Authored by: Tristan\n\n# Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development. This proposal deals with the Administrative and Operational (Admin & Ops) element of the OpCo. It has been discussed in detail in this [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Admin & Ops should be considered as a part of this proposal.\n\nThe Product Development element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal.\n\n## Administrative & Operations\n\nServing as the operating entity with which third-party Service Providers to the Balancer DAO will contract, submit invoices to, and from which they will be paid whether that be in fiat or in tokens. This role is integral to the decentralised operations of the Balancer ecosystem, and in practice supports the healthy long term functioning of the DAO and the Balancer Protocol, and helps the DAO achieve its goals.\n\nThe Balancer OpCo will operate under the direction of the Balancer Foundation, which will oversee / have responsibility for governance, corporate administration and operations. This includes hosting and managing software subscriptions and login credentials for the OpCo team and certain ecosystem-wide platforms and social media accounts. An addition for year two is in-house Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that the Ecosystem Council proposes be retained by OpCo as a new addition to the OpCo budget. As a reminder, the Foundation operates under the governance of the DAO.\n\nA little more on GRC: given their experience with the Balancer Ecosystem, we are proposing Warburton continue this role. Hours are reduced under this proposed budget. In terms of scope, Warburton will provide GRC advice to support the [Balancer Ecosystem Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409) which includes major service providers (SPs). Warburton will provide reporting to the Ecosystem Council as requested and protect confidentiality so Balancer has the ability to defend itself from unnecessary disclosure in litigation or government inquiries.\n\nGRC services will be focused on protecting the resiliency, and facilitating the growth, of the ecosystem through the Council members (and major SPs). GRC efforts will protect Balancer by focusing on further decentralization strategy and implementation, US regulatory risks and Balancer objectives to understand and proactively protect against potential threats from legal/regulatory changes. GRC will also include keeping the Ecosystem Council current on matters of regulatory changes and sentiment, monitoring the GRC program including review of marketing/comms, conflicts of interest, VASP, sanctions and exemptions/exclusions from other evolving global requirements, assessment and negotiation of material contracts for disclosed council members and SPs and management of regulatory inquiries, investigations and/or litigation and strategy for Ecosystem Council with external counsel as needed. GRC will be handled “in-house” to extent practical to minimize external counsel costs and time. Please note that this is an internal facing role that will report to the Ecosystem Council including OpCo, not directly to the DAO. The scope of hours may be expanded to cover needs as pre-approved by OpCo. Warburton would operate on a 30-day notice period.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nOne year - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through June 2024 (Q2 FY24) divided into four quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be returned to the Balancer Treasury, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal or other SPs.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![opco1.png](ipfs://bafkreiftgnzjubhz7bobic73bm46y7tsnkazaj6dxrupm53gpq4ctzf4x4)\n    \n\n### Requests for USDC transfers:\n\nThe OpCo holds funds due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3. We propose that USDC funding needs for OpCo be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the twelve months of the OpCo budget based on current information.\n\nQ3 FY23 - USDC 76,379 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ4 FY23 - USDC 55,979 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ1 FY24 - USDC 61,991 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ2 FY24 - USDC 55,989 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nAdmin & Ops has no BAL requirements.\n\n### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe projected spend associated with this proposal (and that of the Product Development Team for a possible 9-month proposal) can both be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.\n\nFor objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 4% of combined current unallocated OpCo funds and current Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).\n\n### Non-People Costs - Operations & Administration\n\nThe main items in this section are legal and compliance costs (more below), monthly bookkeeping service (we continue to perform the “CFO” element in house for the foreseeable future in order to keep costs down). We have included a $20,000 estimate in Q3 for Directors and Officers insurance - actual costs could be materially different. Software subscriptions included here are for operations (G-suite, QBO) and ecosystem-wide services such as Dune Analytics, Discourse, Slack, Notion and Asana. Q3 2023 includes a one-off amount of $10,000 in case a deposit is required for a new bank account.\n\nThe largest increase relates to in-house Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that the Ecosystem Council proposes be retained by OpCo as a new addition to the OpCo budget, effective 1 August, 2023. As mentioned, we are proposing Warburton continue this role. Hours are reduced under this budget compared with year one, to a fixed monthly fee of $10,500, or $115,500 for 11 months. If this needs to be revisited it will be dealt with in a future proposal.\n\nThe total amount sought for Non-people costs, Operations and Administration is USDC 250,338. Broken down by category:\n\n* Administrative costs: USDC 11,800 - Registered Office/Agent, Registrar of Companies Fees, Annual Compliance Services, Bank fees, Gas fees, hardware wallet if needed.\n\n* Directors’ and Officers’ insurance: USDC 20,000 (estimate)\n\n* Establishment of new banks account(s): USDC 10,000 (estimate)\n\n* Internal GRC - total for the year (11 months in this case) USDC 115,500. This represents the minimum internal GRC support required for the items mentioned in the proposal - that is - the day-to-day of the operations. To keep the budget lean, we have removed the proposed buffer budget that was in the previous draft. \n\nThe fixed part of the proposed GRC amount represents 20 hours per month (roughly 5 hours per week) at USCC 525 per hour. This is the USDC 10.5k per month. For baseline, Warburton is currently contracted to Balancer at 20 hours per week (not through OpCo) and is fully occupied. This budget is a 75% reduction in time, and therefore yet to be seen how it works. We have edited this proposal to remove the buffer, and will raise a specific proposal should the need arise on a specific matter.\n\nThere is a cost benefit of having someone experienced that can cover multiple issues, jurisdictions, entities and topics - for illustration one person’s hourly rates vs having multiple specialists and having two or more lawyers on a call, all charging per hour. With this proposed arrangement, GRC would support the Foundation, OpCo, B Labs, Beets, Maxis and other members of Ecosystem Council as well as major SPs. This resource would not just be dedicated to providing services to one entity.\n\n* The estimate for external GRC is USDC 24,000 for the year. \n\n* Bookkeeping / Accounting services estimated at USDC 24,000 for the year (USDC 2,000 per month). This also is a very low budget given industry comparables, but we are hopeful of achieving this.\n\n* Software services for the Ecosystem and OpCo administration USDC 45,038\n\n# ETH Address to Receive Funds:\n\nNot necessary as this proposal can be covered by funds currently held at the Balancer OpCo.\n\n# Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this is internal / for the OpCo itself.",
