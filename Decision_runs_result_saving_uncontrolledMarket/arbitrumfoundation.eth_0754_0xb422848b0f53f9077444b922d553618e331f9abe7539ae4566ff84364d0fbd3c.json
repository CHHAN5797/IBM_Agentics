        "body": "This is a temperature check to gauge the DAO's overall opinion on creating official conflict of interest and self-voting policies. No social contract, guidelines, or policy will be adopted directly from the result of this vote. \n\nPlease find the full proposal on the forums, certain sections such as Enforcement and Timeline have been removed to adhere to character limits: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-create-coi-self-voting-policies/26062\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to restart the conversation around the creation of self-voting and conflict of interests policies. The proposal outlines various options, ranging from maintaining the status quo to enforcing strict self-voting policies. A Snapshot vote to gauge the DAO's sentiment will be posted on Thursday, August 15th. Please note, this is an **actual temperature check**, just to gauge the DAO’s opinion on the subject. Based on the results, certain policies may be included in a future delegate of code of conduct as part of an effort to professionalize the DAO’s operations.\n\n## Background\n\nStrict policies regarding conflicts of interest (COI) and self-dealing are standard practices in traditional corporate industries. However, with crypto just now emerging from an early stage, entirely avoiding conflict of interests is challenging. Many individuals are either investors, employees, or contributors across multiple companies/protocols on not only Arbitrum, but other L1/L2 chains.\n\nSeveral other DAOs have established a code of conduct in an attempt to address these issues. Examples range from being opt-in recommendations ([Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-delegate-code-of-conduct/20913)), simple pledges ([Maker](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384), [Gitcoin](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/code-of-conduct), [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-delegate-code-of-conduct/12981)), and strict no self-dealing policies & expectations enforced by a council and violations resulting in suspension from the DAO’s platforms (Optimism: [Code of Conduct Committee](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101), [Optimist Expectations](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241)).\n\nWhile Arbitrum has standard [rules of engagement](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807?u=pruitt) for the forums, it currently lacks a delegate code of conduct in addition to an official policy on conflicts of interest. The only mention of the term in the Arbitrum [Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) is in relation to candidate eligibility for the Security Council.\n\nCreating a self-voting policy was first [raised](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886/8) by @Immutablelawyer at the beginning of 2024 following the LTIPP council elections. While the post resulted in a good discussion, many delegates at the time indicated a strong preference to not move forward with any policy that restricted a delegate’s ability to vote. Thus a temperature check to gather the larger DAO’s sentiment on this issue never occurred.\n\nIn recent weeks, the topic has reemerged in conversations, and as part of a series of proposals focusing on professionalizing the Arbitrum DAO’s operations, Entropy Advisors is looking to restart the conversation on a proposed self-voting and COI policy in order to reach a definite consensus. Policies that are voted are favored by the DAO will be included in a future delegate code of conduct proposal.\n\n## Rationale\n\nWe would argue that within a DAO’s operations, the majority of instances involving COI are the result of an individual/company using their delegated voting power to engage in self-voting or “self-enrichment”. This can exist when a delegate votes for themselves to get elected to a committee, thereby receiving financial gain, or a delegate votes in favor of a proposal that directly benefits themselves or their company. There are certainly other situations where COI can arise such as oversight, but for the purposes of this proposal, the focus is centered on the practice of self-voting.\n\nFor clarity and the purposes of this conversation we will lean on the definitions that @Immutablelawyer established back when the topic of self-voting was previously [discussed](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886).\n\n* **Conflicts of Interest:** A situation where a token-holder or their close-associates stand to directly benefit from the outcome of a proposal.\n* **Self-Voting:** The practice of where token holders use their voting power to vote on proposals that involve or benefit themselves.\n* **Self-Enrichment (Self-Dealing):** The act of increasing or enhancing one’s own personal financial wealth as a result of one's own vote.\n\nAs mentioned above, the majority of comments indicated that it was unwise to restrict a delegate’s ability to vote in any manner. To paraphrase the discussion, hesitation to implement a self-voting policy boiled down to primarily two reasons:\n\n* **Philosophical Objections:** Delegates are entrusted by token holders to best represent their own values and interests. Forcing a delegate to abstain from a vote due to COI concerns prevents the delegate from truly representing their base’s interests and thus disenfranchises the token holders delegating.\n* **Lack of Enforceability:** Even if self-voting was monitored manually by contributors or a committee, it is quite easy to circumvent self-voting policies onchain by simply transferring voting power to anonymous wallets. To quote @DisruptionJoe, in general, “unenforceable rules create situations where bad actors have an advantage over good actors''.\n\nWhile both are strong objections, there are positives to implementing COI and self-voting policies. First, they help establish the “rules of the game”, so that every participant in Arbitrum governance is operating under the same set of expectations. Furthermore, disclosure requirements can help lead to greater transparency while also incentivizing participants to act in an ethical manner. Most importantly, with such policies standard practice in other industries, Arbitrum DAO can improve its image as a professional organization by holding its actors to similar standards.\n\n## Specifications\n\nBelow are a few policy options the DAO can adopt to help address and mitigate COI and self-voting. The options are presented from least restrictive (do nothing) to what we view as the most restrictive.\n\n**Keep the Status Quo:** Arbitrum DAO can continue to operate as it has been. A delegate code of conduct does not need to include specific policies on disclosure or self-voting.\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a potential COI exists, it is expected that proposal authors or delegates disclose the nature and extent of the interest. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain “directly” or “indirectly”, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency. Delegates are not expected to abstain or alter their voting preferences in any way, but are free to choose to abstain.\n\n**“Responsible Voting” Policy in Elections:** In an election with multiple seats, candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill the remaining positions. Put more simply, a candidate should not cast a vote solely for themselves in an election. In the case of a weighted voting election, the candidate's weight for themself should not be larger than the weights for other candidate. To the best of their ability they should strive to make the weights as equal as possible among the number of candidates necessary to fill each position. \n\n* Example: I am running in the GCP council election, which has 3 open seats. I can vote for my own candidacy, but must also cast 2 additional votes for other candidates.\n\nThis is a policy that has worked well in other DAOs and helps address the natural incentive to withhold votes for competing candidates in an election while also making sure token-holders are not disenfranchised.\n\nCredit to @JoJo for the term “Responsible Voting”.\n\n**Strict Self-Voting Policy:** In the event of a conflict of interest, under the simple definitions stated in the Rationale above, it is expected that a delegate or proposal author abstains during the voting process. In the event that \"Abstain\" is not presented as a voting option, it is expected that the delegate votes in a neutral manner as to not impact the results of the vote. For example, in an election a delegate may even divide their voting power in equal weight to effectively abstain. This policy would include candidates being prevented from self-voting in elections and delegates from voting on proposals that directly benefit oneself, company, or interests.\n\n### Voting Choices\n\nThe temperature check on Snapshot will use [approval voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types). Each delegate can select any number of choices, each selected choice will receive equal voting power. So for example, if a delegate wishes to see the DAO adopt both a disclosure policy and responsible voting, then they should select both options on the Snapshot vote.\n\nSince this is a proposal that changes the DAO’s current status quo, the following choices have been worded in a manner that each “FOR” vote indicates desire to adopt a certain policy.",

        "body": "This description has been heavily shortened due to character limits. Please refer to the forums for the full proposal. https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrum-dao-delegate-code-of-conduct-formalizing-the-daos-operations/27188\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces a delegate code of conduct for Arbitrum DAO alongside additional improvements to the DAO’s operational standards.\n\nIf approved, the Code of Conduct and operational updates will take effect on Monday, November 11th, followed by a ~6.5-month trial period ending on May 30th before being considered for permanent inclusion in the Arbitrum Constitution.\n\n## Motivation/Rationale\n\nAs the Arbitrum DAO continues to grow and evolve, a standardized code of conduct for delegates becomes increasingly necessary to create a culture that attracts high quality contributors. As the leading scaling solution across most notable metrics and one of the most active governance ecosystems, it is also important for the Arbitrum DAO to lead the industry in terms of professionalism and transparency.\n\nEstablishing clear and strict rules of conduct can be challenging and even counterproductive; therefore, the primary goal of the Delegate Code of Conduct is to help the Arbitrum DAO foster a culture of transparency, integrity, and civility. The Code of Conduct is a set of written principles that Arbitrum Delegates should embody. Delegates should use their best discretion and act in a way that aligns with the Code's spirit, rather than seeking to exploit loopholes or ambiguities.\n\n## The Arbitrum DAO Delegate Code of Conduct\n\n### Values Alignment\n\nArbitrum Delegates should always strive to uphold the seven community values stated in the Arbitrum Constitution. \n\n* **Ethereum-aligned:** Arbitrum is part of the Ethereum ecosystem and community\n* **Sustainable:** Focus on long-term health of the protocol over short-term gains\n* **Secure:** Arbitrum is security minded\n* **Socially inclusive:** Open and welcoming to all constructive participants\n* **Technically inclusive:** Accessible for ordinary people with ordinary technology\n* **User-focused:** Managed for the benefit of all users\n* **Neutral and open:** Foster open innovation, interoperation, user choice, and healthy competition\n\n### Good Faith and Best Interest\n\n* Delegates should conduct themselves with honesty, integrity, and transparency, fostering trust and confidence among community members.\n* Delegates should act and vote in accordance with what they see is in the best interests of Arbitrum, which encompasses but is not limited to all of the following: Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, the Orbit Ecosystem, the ARB token, and any future Arbitrum DAO-governed chains as outlined in the Arbitrum Constitution. \n\n### Due Care and Attention\n\n* Delegates should remain knowledgeable of developments in regards to Arbitrum DAO’s initiatives and the broader Arbitrum ecosystem. \n* Delegates should make a professional and unbiased review of each proposal before submitting their vote.\n* Delegates are advised to vote abstain when unable to conduct the necessary diligence to understand the proposals.\n\n### Civility and Professionalism\n\n* While separate from the Code of Conduct, delegates are expected to uphold the community guidelines for activity on the Arbitrum DAO forum and de-facto understood gathering places for the Arbitrum DAO, whether online or in-person.\n* Delegates should seek to create a respectful and inclusive environment for all community members, free from harassment and discrimination.\n  * Examples of unacceptable behavior include:\n    * Publicly or privately harassing or intimidating others\n    * Sharing someone's private information without their consent\n    * Using sexualized language or imagery, or making unwanted advances\n    * Making insulting or derogatory comments about others\n * Delegates should strive to provide constructive feedback that is well-researched and respectful, focusing on the proposal's merits. Personal attacks are never acceptable.\n* Delegates should be open-minded and respectful of differing viewpoints, even if they disagree with them. Disagreements are an inevitable part of healthy debate, but they often yield positive results when approached in a civil manner.\n* Delegates should make a best effort to provide constructive feedback through appropriate channels and avoid taking discussions to social media in a manner that could tarnish Arbitrum DAO’s brand and reputation.\n\n### Responsibility\n\n* Maintaining a culture of productive debate, integrity, and transparency requires a sense of collective responsibility. As entrusted leaders of the Arbitrum community, delegates should take responsibility in fostering and maintaining a culture that promotes the principles outlined herein.\n* Best practices of responsible delegates:\n  * **Participation:** delegates should make an effort to vote (even if abstain) on all proposals.\n  * **Communication:** delegates should clearly communicate their rationale behind votes and discussions to the Arbitrum community.\n  * **Accountability:** delegates should maintain knowledge of funded initiatives and hold managing parties or elected representatives accountable.\n  * **Responsiveness:** delegates should use their best efforts to connect with the Arbitrum community and be accessible to answer questions or concerns.\n\n### Conflicts of Interest\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a conflict of interest exists, it is expected the delegate discloses the nature and extent of the conflict in writing on the forum before voting. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain “directly” or “indirectly”, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency.\n\nDelegates that disclose a conflict of interest are not expected to alter their voting in any way. However, as explained further below, a delegate that repeatedly fails to disclose a conflict of interest before self-voting or if a single instance is deemed to be severe, they risk being removed from the Delegate Incentive Program or a DAO-elected position.\n\n### Conflict Resolution and Enforcement\n\nThe Code of Conduct has been purposefully written in a manner to establish a set principles that Arbitrum Delegates should embody rather than a complete set of enforceable rules.\n\n**Conflict Resolution between Delegates**\n\nIn general, it is our belief that many conflict issues can be resolved quickly and easily if approached in good faith by each party. Delegates and community members are encouraged to first address the behavior directly in private. If the matter is unable to be resolved for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it to the Arbitrum Foundation using this form.\n\n**Soft-Enforcement of the Delegate Code of Conduct**\n\nWhile it is not feasible to hold every governance participant accountable for upholding these principles, the DAO can hold accountable delegates compensated or individuals it elects to positions of power. \n\n**Delegate Incentive Program Removal**\n\nAs stated in the Delegate Incentive Program proposal, the program administrator reserves the right to issue a suspension or permanent ban if a delegate does not meet the eligibility requirements, which includes upholding the Code of Conduct. \n\n**DAO-Elected Position Removal**\n\nAny DAO member can propose a Snapshot vote to remove a DAO-elected representative. The proposal should clearly state the reasons for removal and provide evidence supporting the claims. \n\n## Standardizing the DAO’s Operations\n\n### Voting Schedule\n\nAs ratified in a Snapshot vote to improve predictability in the Arbitrum DAO’s operations, delegates agree to abide by the vote scheduling guidelines. \n\n### Election Standards\n\nThe Responsible Voting policy is an effort to strike a balance between preventing delegates from unfavorably electing themselves into a position of power and compensation while allowing them to still effectively represent their communities and tokenholders. In a normal election with multiple seats, the policy is simple: candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill all the remaining positions. With token and weighted voting, there are additional nuances and guidelines must be set in place to address edge scenarios.\n\n**Shielded Elections with Weighted Voting:** A few weeks ago the Entropy team posted a temperature check to gauge the DAO’s stance on shielded voting. The results indicated that a slight majority of delegates favored the use of shielded voting as the default for elections. In order to align with Security Council elections, weighted voting as opposed to approval voting will be the official default voting type.\n\n**Minimum Application Period:** In order to draw a sufficient number of high quality applicants, application periods should be a minimum of 14 days.\n\nWhere n = number of seats; proposal authors should seek to have at least n+3 applicants before starting the election. Since this may not always be possible, it is simply a recommendation and not a requirement.\n\n### Delegating to the Arbitrum Exclude Address\n\nARB tokens allocated to DAO initiatives are not to be used in governance. To keep circulating voting supply from increasing, whenever possible, multi-sigs holding program funds should delegate to the Arbitrum Exclude Address. This will prevent tokens from being included in quorum calculations. \n\n## Timeline\n\nBefore codifying the Arbitrum Code of Conduct and updates to the DAO’s operations into the Arbitrum Constitution, we believe it is best to trial the changes for a period of 6 months post ratification of this proposal. At which point, any necessary changes or delegate feedback can be incorporated. Depending on sentiment and the changes made, the trial period can be extended another 6 months or a constitutional proposal can be put forth to update the language of the Constitution.",
