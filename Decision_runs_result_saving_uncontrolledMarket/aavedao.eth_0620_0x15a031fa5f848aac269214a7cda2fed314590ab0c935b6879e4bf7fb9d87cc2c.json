    "ai_final_reason": "• The voting timeline demonstrates near-unanimous and stable early support for the entire direct payment option, indicating strong community preference.\n• Forum sentiment analysis shows that most comments favor simplicity and transparency, aligning with choosing full direct payment to the Aave Treasury.\n• Historical adjacent proposals with early strong support similarly led to successful protocol changes, reinforcing confidence in this choice.\n• Market impacts were minor and do not affect the recommendation, which focuses on the organization's long-term health and governance clarity.\n• Some forum concerns about profit sharing implementation and MakerDAO commitments exist but do not outweigh the clear support for option 1.\n• The recommendation mirrors aggregated forum sentiment, indicating the vote outcome reflects community views.",
