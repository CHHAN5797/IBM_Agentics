        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboarding weETH to Aave V3 Ethereum \nAuthor: Ether.fi  & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-02-05\n\n---\n### **Summary**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token (weETH) to Aave V3 Ethereum. In addition, anyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThis move is intended to improve asset diversity on Aave and increase liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is the first decentralized, non-custodial delegated staking protocol with an LRT (eETH). One of the distinguishing characteristics of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is that stakers control their keys. Those who work on the protocol strive for the following:\n\n1. Decentralization is the primary objective. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will never compromise on the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the protocol. Stakers must maintain control of their ETH.\n2. The [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) protocol is a real business with a sustainable revenue model. The team is in this for the long haul. No ponzinomics f*ckery.\n3. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will do the right thing for the Ethereum community, always. If and when the team messes up, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will own it and course correct quickly.\n\n**Staking Primitives**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is working to advance innovation in the space by incorporating staking primitives that reward users and uphold values of decentralization. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is a core feature of Operation Solo Staker, an initiative that [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) helped launch in April 2023. Along with Obol Labs, dappnode and Avado, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) assisted with the first instance of a solo staker cluster using DVT on Mainnet in August 2023. More recently, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) became the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer.\n\n**Tokenomics & Governance**\n\neETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.\n\nUsers are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. As mentioned above, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.\n\nThe goal of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is to make all aspects of the protocol 100% open sourced and ossify the smart contracts to prevent them from being upgraded. The protocol will eventually be governed by a DAO, and those who work on [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) have also committed to self-limiting the amount of ETH staked on the protocol to 25% of the total amount of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain.\n\n**Points System**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) has amassed a following by offering users points based on their activity. Those who stake with [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) have the opportunity to earn both [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) and EigenLayer points that will be used for future incentives.\n\n**On-chain Metrics**\n\n* As of February 3rd, 2024\n* Total Value Locked (TVL): $669,826,357 (290,310.46 ETH)\n* 24-hr trading volume (TV): $4,051,395\n* Max daily deposit: 24,489 ETH (January 25, 2024)\n* Unique eETH holders: 49,858\n* Daily max weETH pools TV: Pendle ($10.33m), Curve ($811.70k), Uniswap ($1.88m), Balancer ($239.66k), Maverick ($4.18m) (January 29, 2024)\n\nYou can view additional [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) stats on [Dune](https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi).\n\n**Risk mitigation**\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.\n\n### Specification\n\n[Ether.fi site](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\nContract Address: [0x35fa164735182de50811e8e2e824cfb9b6118ac2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcd5fe23c85820f7b72d0926fc9b05b43e359b7ee)\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi)\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

While it's relatively young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $130M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:\n\n- Reinforce synergies between Aave and Curve.\n- Offer Aave users an additional decentralized stablecoin option matching the ACI diversity support ethos.\n- Strengthen the relationship between the CRVUSD & the GHO stablecoins.\n\nAs the primary usecase for stablecoins is to be deposited by users looking for a passive yield and used as a borrowable asset and not as much as a collateral asset, the ACI proposes a CRVUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.\n\nFollowing CrvUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for crvUSD at a later stage. \n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: CRVusd  \nContract address: [0xf939E0A03FB07F59A73314E73794Be0E57ac1b4E](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf939E0A03FB07F59A73314E73794Be0E57ac1b4E)  \nPrice Feed: [0xEEf0C605546958c1f899b6fB336C20671f9cD49F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEEf0C605546958c1f899b6fB336C20671f9cD49F)\n\nWe propose the following parameters for a crvUSD onboarding:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap (CRVUSD) | 60M |\n| Borrow Cap (CRVUSD) | 50M |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A |\n| LTV | N/A |\n| LT | N/A |\n| Liquidation Bonus | N/A |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 5.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 80.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 80.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Stable Slope1 | 13.00% |\n| Stable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset | 3.00% |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset | 8.00% |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Curve for creating this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum \nAuthor: Kelp DAO & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-02-20\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 470 Mn+ (~168k Eth) TVL\n- 18K restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH and sfrxETH and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >12 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $4 Mn\n    - [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-67/deposit) - $4 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x64939a882c7d1b096241678b7a3a57ed19445485) - $3.2 Mn\n    - [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x1b06f8fc94b95b6a8075aa1dcf12e69c70144c52?chain=1) - $0.9 Mn\n- $3.5 Mn average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 17th Feb)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nExchange rate is calculated basis the formula:\n\nrseth / eth = [(asset amount in protocol * asset price in ETH)rsETH total supply]\n\nrsEth relies on multiple contract exchange rates for:\n\n1. stEth: As this is a rebasing token, the balance of stETH changes over time and the asset price is taken as 1stETH = 1 ETH.\n\n2. ETHx: Asset price is taken from getExchangeRate( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf5EA1b38380f6aF39068375516Daf40Ed70D299#readProxyContract\n\n3. Sfrxeth: Asset price is taken from pricePerShare( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/token/0xac3e018457b222d93114458476f3e3416abbe38f\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nAs of today, the only way to exit rsETH is via DEXs. KelpDAO is going to enable withdrawals by mid-March 2024 after which users can withdraw Eth or any LSTs via KelpDAO dapp.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n- Contract Address: [0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n- [Github Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "title": "[ARFC] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market",
        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:\n\n* Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n* Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n* Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)\n\nWe propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.\n\nIf the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: PYUSD\nContract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8\n](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)Price Feed: [0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1)\n\nChainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)\n\nWe propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap (PYUSD)|10M|\n|Borrow Cap (PYUSD)|9M|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|N/A|\n|LT|N/A|\n|Liquidation Bonus|N/A|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|80.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|8.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n|Flashloanable|No|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n\n## Liquidity and Market Cap\n\nThe PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.\n\n![|624x488](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/X-CIRWD8o7MXopvExHIFu0nv9useOuTbrMej_SoD_zJskFtFpkHtvBVietrrSEjtVsfHdoUtOlSxfRCdH2HzoIJg-VpGcZhsfebkk17eDhBoS3RKPijCFDP2D_XbMKeJ1C-jP8XeTWtOwJpPEhLC3Fk)\n\nWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.\n\n![|604x476](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WzRKS4ZDZop1OhjeZG-qnhCYb3x3zT5bT8gE6AlJAJZBjcqmWMR7HcKXnrngqWlUV3MYeZI-W3xcMHRzFx6RA-BCDF3_SrKJR4ahLDB2jVp6Rm0-12PbBSrrgD6l-D23uhk8Kogpr2lVYEIiMCYtn7U)\n\nWith peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.\n\n### Initial Supply and Borrow Caps\n\nPYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.\n\n### Variable Borrow Rate\n\nWe recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.\n\n### Borrowable in Isolation\n\nWe do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Paxos or Trident and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. . If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
