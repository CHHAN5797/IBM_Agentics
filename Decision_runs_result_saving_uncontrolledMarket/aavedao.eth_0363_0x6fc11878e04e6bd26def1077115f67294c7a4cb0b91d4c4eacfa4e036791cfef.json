        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Introducing \"Curator\" by Llama\nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon and Fermin\ncreated: 2023-07-11\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces the `Curator` by Llama.\n\nThe `Curator` is a dedicated contract for managing the exchange of assets with MEV and price-impact protection, where possible.\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the Curator:\n\n* Swap Assets\n* Acquire LSTs\n* Transfer Assets\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe DAO is required to exchange assets. This could be to reduce the DAOs exposure to long tail assets or to increase stable coin holdings to facilitate payment to various service providers. It is not possible to perform swaps directly from the Collector / Treasury Contract. After much discussion, @llamaxyz and @bgdlabs have concluded that it is not viable to upgrade the Collector Contract to facilitate the efficient management of the DAO's assets. As a result, a series of separate contracts are required. \n\nA part of this solution is the `Curator`. The `Curator` receives assets from the Collector / Treasury Contract, swaps (or deposits) assets and sends the newly received asset to another address. The `Curator` is intended for solely exchanging assets and not holding assets. \n\nThe first iteration of the `Curator` is to be deployed on Ethereum and then later introduced to other networks. On Ethereum, the `Curator` is to interact with CoW Swap, Lido Protocol, and Rocket Pool contracts. \n\nTo limit the surface area of the contract, an `AllowList` will define which contracts the `Curator`can be interacted with. The `ShortExecutor` must first add each contract address to the `AllowList`. \n\nIt is possible to assign the `curatorRole()` to a specified wallet address, Treasury Manager. The `curatorRole` can then only interact with contract on the `AllowList` set by governance. The `AllowList` eliminates the risk of the `Curator` interacting with a malicious contract or running away with the DAO's funds. The intent is to implement the highest heirarchy of control.\n\nFor future deployments of the `Curator` on other networks, the aggregator protocol used to swap assets with MEV protection does so over a lengthy time horizon. This prevents any further steps performed by the same AIP submission. In these instances the `curatorRole` offers more flexibility and reduces the AIP overhead.\n\nEach Curator deployment will contain different functionality tailored to that network and Aave DAO's needs. As a result, each deployment will be presented to Aave DAO as an [ARFC] proposal for the community to discuss and vote on. \n\nDuring the intial deployment on Ethereum, @Llamaxyz advocates for using the `ShortExecutor` to perform all the necessary transactions. The `curatorRole` can be assigned at a later date. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe Ethereum Curator will provide the following functionality to Aave Protocol: \n\n1. Receive assets from the Treasury (assets must be pushed)\n2. Redeem aTokens for underlying spanning Aave v1, v2, and v3\n3. Swap assets via CoW Swap with MEV protection and using Milkman\n4. No reentrant \n5. Cancel trade\n6. Rescue tokens\n7. allowTokens(address[] tokens) onlyExecutorOrAllowedCaller\n8. Deposit ETH into Lido Finance Protocol to receive stETH\n9. Wrap stETH to create wstETH\n10. Deposit ETH into Rocket Pool's contract to receive rETH\n11. Transfer assets to Treasury\n12. Call a function to deposit assets in Aave v3 on behalf of Treasury\n13. Allow-list tokens/contracts that can be interacted with\n14. Allow-list Executor and approved multisig, CuratorRole().\n\nThe Curator will contain an `AllowList` defining which contracts the contract can interact with. The `AllowList` can only be updated by Aave Governance via the `ShortExecutor`. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance.\n\nThe [ARFC] publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].\n\n# Disclosure\n\n@llamaxyz is a service provider to Aave DAO.

        "body": "**Title:** [ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO\n\n**Author:** Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n**Date:** 2023-11-21\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC introduces an enhancement to the Safety Module by integrating a GHO Safety Module. This new category aims to mitigate risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events within its ecosystem. It also reduces the Safety incentives for StkAAVE and StkBPT.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[AIP-366 was adopted by governance](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/366/) to reduce the safety incentives of StkAAVE and StkBPT, but an implementation bug made the AIP execution impossible. After discussion with DAO service providers, it was decided to bundle the re-run of 366 with the creation of the GHO safety module and the StkGHO asset.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will fortify the Aave Protocol's resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversifies the Safety Module's capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will target a liquidity pool of 9M GHO with an APR range of 12-15%, achievable with a daily emission of 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day period. The module will have a slashing rate set at 100%, meaning the entirety of the deposits could be utilized in a shortfall event, with socialized coverage among StkGHO holders. The cooldown period is adjusted to 10 days, which is suitable for a stablecoin.\n\n## Specification\n**Revised Safety Module Emissions Rate:**\n\n| Asset      | Previous Emissions | Proposed Emissions |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| StkAAVE    | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkBPT     | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkGHO     | N/A               | 35 AAVE/day        |\n\n- **GHO Safety Module Parameters:**\n  - Target Liquidity: 9M GHO\n  - Target APR: 12-15%\n  - Emissions Period: 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day cycle\n  - Slashing Rate: 100%\n  - Cooldown Period: 10 days\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and has not been compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

As productive assets, LSTs are high quality collateral to borrow against. Given their high correlation to ETH, LSTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nosETH in particular is overcollateralized by design, providing in-built slashing protection and consequently an increased level of protection for the Aave protocol..\n\nAs StakeWise V3 provides solo stakers to ability to mint osETH against their own nodes, on-boarding osETH will benefit Aave, StakeWise, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and be an important step in the pursuit to diversify Ethereum staking and encourage staking from home.\n\nThe onboarding of osETH will consequently create increased osETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and StakeWise protocols, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of osETH.\n\n## Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nEthereum mainnet\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n[V3 Litepaper](https://stakewise.io/stakewise-v3.pdf)\n\n[V3 Docs](https://docs-v3.stakewise.io/)\n\n[What is osETH?](https://stakewise.medium.com/what-is-oseth-a-deep-dive-into-the-overcollateralized-staked-ether-token-of-stakewise-v3-part-1-37d14e28282a)\n\n[Audits - Sigma Prime and Halborn](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)\n\n[Github Page](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core)\n\nCommunities:  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Stakewise for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.

Users can freely mint frxETH in exchange for ETH deposits.\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative supports LST diversity in Aave V3 as shown with our historical support of cbETH, rETH, and, parallel to this proposal, our support for ETHx.\n\nThis proposal is a reboot of https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-proposal-onboarding-sfrxeth-from-frax-protocol-to-aave-v3-ethereum-market/11510 from January. More details for sFrxETH can be found in the first proposal.\n\n\n## Specification\n- **Contract Address: sfrxETH : [0xac3e018457b222d93114458476f3e3416abbe38f](https://etherscan.io/token/0xac3e018457b222d93114458476f3e3416abbe38f)\n\nProposed risk parameters will be shared at the potential ARFC stage of this proposal.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n1) if TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE development of a detailed ARFC with technical specifications and implementation plans.\n2) Escalation to ARFC snapshot \n3) if ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to the AIP stage\n\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Frax Protocol and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
