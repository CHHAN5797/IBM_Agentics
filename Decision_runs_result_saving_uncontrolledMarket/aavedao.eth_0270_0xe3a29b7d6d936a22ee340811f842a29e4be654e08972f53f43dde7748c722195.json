        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the **frozen** V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. \n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. \n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n- “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |\n| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |\n| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |\n| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |\n- “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |\n| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |\n| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

In this proposal, we suggest an increase of  5% for all V2 collateral assets.\n\n## Specification\n\nFrozen Assets:\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV* | Current RF | Rec RF |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 35% / 45% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| BAT | 52% | 38% / 42% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| DPI | 42% | 22% / 32% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 0 | 0 | 45% | 50% |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 | 45% | 50% |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 70% | 65% | 25% | 30% |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 40% | 30% | 25% | 30% |\n| UNI | 77% | 57% / 67% | 65% | 45% / 55% | 25% | 30% |\n| SNX | 59% | 39% / 49% | 46% | 26% / 36% | 40% | 45% |\n| MKR | 64% | 44% / 55% | 59% | 39% / 49% | 25% | 30% |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 47% | 40% | 25% | 30% |\n- Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options.\n\nUnfrozen Assets\n\n| Asset | Current RF | Recommended RF |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DAI | 15% | No Change - will be addressed in a separate proposal  |\n| FRAX | 25% | 30% |\n| GUSD | 15% | 20% |\n| LUSD | 15% | 20% |\n| sUSD | 25% | 30% |\n| TUSD | 25% | 30% |\n| USDC | 15% | 20% |\n| USDP | 15% | 20% |\n| USDT | 15% | 20% |\n| CRV | 25% | 30% |\n| WBTC | 25% | 30% |\n| ETH | 20% | 25% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for CRV on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing our recommendations to decrease Aave’s exposure to CRV on V2 Ethereum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31), we propose a series of LT and LTV reductions. The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum. \n\nGiven the current conditions and protocol usage, we propose 2 options for the community to vote on:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-CRV-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-7-10-32dc4ed994be4029b05af831ce5ea537).\n2. “Moderate” - 3% reduction. This option is aligned with the previous reduction and the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nIn the table below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. \n\n| Option | Liquidation Threshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Moderate | 52 | 3 | $46 |\n| Aggressive | 49 | 5 | $116 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 55 | 52 / 49 | -3% / -6% |\n| CRV | LTV | 49 | 46 / 43 | -3% / -6% |\n\n*Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the “aggressive” and “moderate” options*\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust risk parameters for WBTC.e on Avalanche deployments, to limit further exposure and promote user migration to BTC.b:\n\n- V2\n    - Freeze asset\n    - Reduce Liquidation Threshold and LTV\n- V3\n    - Freeze asset\n    - Reduce Liquidation Threshold and LTV\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs the Avalanche network is transitioning away from WBTC.e, we are observing an ongoing decrease in WBTC.e liquidity on-chain, with approximately 30% of the liquidity diminishing over the past few months. At this time, the total circulating supply on Avalanche is 1,731 WBTC.e. A  considerable portion, nearly 67%, of the circulating supply is concentrated on Aave Avalanche V2 and V3, with ~496 and ~664 tokens, respectively. \n\nGiven the persistence of this trend, we suggest reducing exposure on Aave and proactively modifying risk parameters for the asset. This strategy aims to:\n\n1.  Avert a potential scenario where there is inadequate liquidity to facilitate liquidations in Aave deployments.\n2. Motivate new and existing users on Aave to transition to BTC.b, which has a stronger liquidity profile on Avalanche.\n\n### Limit New Supply\n\nFreeze the WBTC.e reserves on V2 and V3 Avalanche.\n\n### Reduce Capital Efficiency\n\nAdditionally, as a precautionary measure and to further reduce exposure to the asset, we recommend reducing LTs and LTV, without impacting current holders:\n\n- V3 - reduce LT to 70 % and LTV to 0.\n- V2 - reduce LT to 70% and LTV to 0.\n  - at this time, this will lead to 6 accounts totaling $15 to be liquidated.\n\n# Specification\n\n### V3 Avalanche\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |\n| WBTC.e | LTV | 70% | 0% |\n| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |\n\n### V2 Avalanche\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |\n| WBTC.e | LTV | 60% | 0% |\n| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market conditions and its parameters on other deployments.\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Analysis\n\nChaos Labs recommends a 15% reduction. As of October 25, seven total accounts amounting to ~$141 are at risk of liquidation following the proposed changes.\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | 65% | 50% | 141 | 8 |\n\nList of affected accounts:\n\n| Account | Total Supply (USD) | Total CRV Supplied | Total Borrows (USD) | Health | Health After Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0x9ce21324617b6b573e75d28580dcd5a88c41b4bb | 106 | 29.16 | 86.47 | 1.01 | 0.99 |\n| 0xa21fa160a63993d06daf2cb22f66b9a118a25ed4 | 97 | 200.43 | 59.14 | 1.07 | 0.83 |\n| 0xf36375ef8ef450476541f6326631cac44f9f0a49 | 58 | 40.18 | 41.22 | 1.07 | 0.99 |\n| 0xe9784ffc614fe5cc57939cc7b21cdd2cf8f61c86 | 17 | 34.88 | 10.60 | 1.09 | 0.86 |\n| 0x6c62b64c4e1a4702a41c47d5cdafc29fcba0ebad | 12 | 25.77 | 6.63 | 1.23 | 0.95 |\n| 0xdb79b400a31997ebc6816f002f2b622fe186056a | 12 | 25.57 | 6.63 | 1.22 | 0.94 |\n| 0x0906f3f07c7211bdce20d8a7cf9bdd7c3306532d | 4 | 6.7 | 2.65 | 1.14 | 0.96 |\n| 0x304481771f4922b60a759ac363da3a7da6372cc1 | 4 | 0.83 | 3.5 | 1.02 | 1.00 |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 65% | 50% | -15% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.
