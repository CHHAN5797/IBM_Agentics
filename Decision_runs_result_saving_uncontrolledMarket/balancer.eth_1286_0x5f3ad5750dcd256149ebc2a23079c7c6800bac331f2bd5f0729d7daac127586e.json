        "body": "[BIP-97] Enable IB/rETH 50/50 Gauge [Optimism]\n\nSummary:\n\nProposal to add a gauge of IB/rETH 50/50 on Optimism\n\nReferences/Useful links:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Website: https://app.ib.xyz/\n* Documentation: https://docs.ib.xyz/\n* Github Page: https://github.com/ibdotxyz\n* Communities:\n  * Twitter: https://twitter.com/ibdotxyz\n  * Medium: https://ibdotxyz.medium.com/\n  * Discord: https://discord.gg/4HwFTcjY78\n* Other useful links?\n\nProtocol Description:\n\n* The proposed asset(s): IB\n* the corresponding protocol(s): Iron Bank - a decentralized lending platform focused on capital efficiency allowing protocols and individuals to supply and borrow cryptoassets.\n* Historic prices of the token (price must come from the source of highest liquidity):\n  * Dexsceener: https://dexscreener.com/optimism/0xefb0d9f51efd52d7589a9083a6d0ca4de416c24900020000000000000000002c-0x00a35fd824c717879bf370e70ac6868b95870dfb-0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006\n  * Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iron-bank\n\nMotivation/Explain why this pool needs incentivization:\n\n* We would like to expand our liquidity on OP as we continue to provide IB incentives to drive liquidity into our markets on OP. We plan to provide bribe incentives to veBAL holders once the gauge is active, which will bring in both TVL & trading volumes for the balancer/beets.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n* Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n  * Current governance structure: https://docs.ib.xyz/governance\n  * Admin multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/oeth:0xfB9423283EB7F65210B9aB545ecC212B5AE52b3A/\n\n* Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n  * Yes - https://docs.ib.xyz/lending-market/price-oracle\n\n* Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n  * The audit is done by MixBytes and can be found here https://github.com/mixbytes/audits_public/tree/master/Iron%20Bank\n* Centralization vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n  * On IB Optimism, treasury functions and smart contract proxy updates are controlled through a 3/5 multisig\n\n* Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool’s gauge.\n  * The pool has been active since 9/2, 2022 and we’ve directed IB emission to bootstrap the liquidity of this pool.\n  * Currently it has $162K TVL generating over $27K in volume\n  * Link to the pool: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x785f08fb77ec934c01736e30546f87b4daccbe50000200000000000000000041\n  * Link to the capped gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78F50cF01a2Fd78f04da1D9ACF14a51487eC0347#code\n\n* Value: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n  * Yes, this is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for IB.",

It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. MAI has been tested and maintained its peg during several market downturns, notably in May 2022.\n\nThe protocol is currently the #1 external use case for BAL on Polygon. It also incentivizes the main Balancer stablecoin pool on Polygon as well as other pools on Arbitrum and Fantom (Beethoven).\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nMAI is the only means to bridge large sums of capital across the broader crosschain universe. This is a good opportunity for Balancer to capture volume from whales bridging in and out of Ethereum.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    \n\nMAI is controlled by a DAO. More info can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/tokenomics-1/qi-token\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nWe use Chainlink oracles to price collateral assets.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nThe protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nThe protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nMAI has remained stable over the last 12 months, despite adverse market conditions. MAI has held Curve pools for several months, for most of which it has provided a considerable share of volume on Polygon and Fantom.\n\nThe pool in question on this proposal was created recently with the aim of launching QiDao on Ethereum.\n \n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) \n\nThis will be the only intial incentivized liquidity on Ethereum for MAI.\n\npool link: [Balancer ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xf3aeb3abba741f0eece8a1b1d2f11b85899951cb000200000000000000000351)\n\ngauge address: [Vyper_contract | Address 0x91a75880b07d36672f5c8dfe0f2334f086e29d47 | Etherscan ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91a75880b07d36672f5c8dfe0f2334f086e29d47)",

MAI to be boosted via Aave V3.\n\n**Protocol Descriptions:**\n\nMAI\n\nMAI is the most crosschain decentralized stablecoin. It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. A detailed list of collaterals and risk profiles can be found here. \n\nMAI has a long history of supporting Balancer, through collateral integrations and direct emissions. MAI is currently incentivizing Aura voting for MAI-GHO on Ethereum with WETH.\n\nDOLA\n\nDOLA is a CDP stablecoin based primarily on Ethereum. It has a long track record in DeFi and a strong player in the L2 liquidity mining space.\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nWith the decline of certain DEXs on Arbitrum, both DOLA and MAI are looking for consistent liquidity base on Arbitrum. Both projects have committed to incentivizing the voting for this gauge with voting incentives. MAI will directly use protocol revenue from Arbitrum (denominated in WETH) for this purpose.\n\n**Specifications**:\n\n**Governance**: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n\nBoth protocols are DAOs and are governed by their communities.\n\n**Oracles**: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nBoth protocols use Chainlink oracles for pricing collaterals.\n\n**Audits**: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nMAI: The protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security\n\nDOLA: Seen the audit for DOLA here: https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/technical/audits\n\n**Centralization vectors**: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nMAI: The protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members. The Aave Guardians standard is currently being implemented at QiDao, with full implementation expected by the end of August.\n\nDOLA: The protocol runs on a decentralized infrastructure, as it is a community-run DAO. Multisigs used within DOLA are disclosed on their site and their holdings are listed.\n\n**Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool’s gauge.\n\nMAI and DOLA have existed for several years, being some of the earliest decentralized stablecoins that are still active. Both stablecoins have experienced short periods of volatility in the past, but have been able to recover promptly.\n\n**Value**: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nThis pool will add to Balancer’s market growth within Arbitrum. MAI and DOLA are popular stablecoins in the L2 space and therefore can bring significant activity,\n\nThis move will also increase the amount of voting incentives being received by Balancer DAO.\n\nLink to pool: [0xA50f89e9f439Fde2a6Fe05883721a00475da3C45](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xa50f89e9f439fde2a6fe05883721a00475da3c45#code)\nLink to gauge: [0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72#readContract)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRedacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nRedacted’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/redactedcartel.eth). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://dineroismoney.com/docs/security).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/ETH pool has not yet been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged. Since launch on 2023/12/13, the main liquidity for pxETH is on Maverick (in anticipation of a gauge on Balancer).\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xdee29b7b6dF3576280bFBbC088ee9eBAA767C0Bd`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "[PR with payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/72)\n\n### Summary:\n\nEnable gauge for gDAI-MAI-USDC on Arbitrum.\n\n### Protocol Descriptions:\n\n#### MAI\n\nMAI is the most crosschain decentralized stablecoin. It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. A detailed list of collaterals and risk profiles can be found [here](https://mai.watch/). MAI has been tested and maintained its peg during several market downturns, notably in May 2022.\n\nMAI currently maintains pools on Balancer’s Ethereum and Polygon deployments.\n\n#### gDAI\n\ngDAI is a receipt token for DAI deposits on Gains Network. DAI is used by gTrade users to perform trading activities. gDAI depositors act as counterparty facilitators to trades on gTrade.\n\nGains Network is a leading defi platform on both Polygon and Arbitrum. The protocol leads rankings as one of the most profitable in defi.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nGains Network has seen impressive growth since its launch on Arbitrum. Demand for gDAI liquidity is high and so far untapped. For this reason, adding a pool for gDAI is a significant opportunity for Balancer to grow on Arbitrum.\n\nThis pool will also represent MAI’s main liquidity hub on Arbitrum. As such, it will take most of the volume related to liquidations and leverage.\n\n### Specifications:\n\n****Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.**\n\nMAI is controlled by a DAO. More info can be found here: link in reply\n\nThere is currently no governance process at Gains Network. A timelock of 2 weeks is in place.\n\n****Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.**\n\nMAI uses Chainlink oracles to price collateral assets.\n\n****Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.**\n\n**MAI:** The protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: link in reply\n\n**gDAI:** Seen the audit for Gains here: link in reply\n\n**Centralization vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.**\n\nMAI: The protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members.\n\nGains: The protocol is run in a decentralized way, with changes made to the protocol being secured under a 2-week timelock.\n\n**Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool’s gauge.**\n\nMAI is one of the most stable decentralized stablecoins and has remained with the peg range for almost 2 years. Below is a chart of normalized volatility for MAI vs peer stablecoins:\n\n \n![bip188.png](ipfs://bafkreidjrnbge7yj77spo7yg4iaokpwqbuazvyxisd34x3mcyi3nlku62q)\n    \n\nThe price of gDAI is largely stable, as the underlying asset is DAI. The price of gDAI fluctuates in correlation to its collateral to debt ratio. This metric and other information related to gDAI can be found [here](https://dune.com/unionepro/Everthing-Gains-Network).\n\nThe pool in question on this proposal was created recently with the aim of kickstarting liquidity for gDAI and MAI on Arbitrum.\n\n**Value: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)**\n\nThis pool will be the main source of liquidity for both gDAI and MAI. It will also be gDAI’s first liquidity pool.\n\nLink to pool: [0x70Ba7DC356B41c849e74c679932c852CC0331a90](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/70BA7DC356B41C849E74C679932C852CC0331A90000000000000000000000357)\nLink to gauge: [0x49A0e3334496442A9706E481617724e7E37EAA08](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49A0e3334496442A9706E481617724e7E37EAA08)\n\n### Specification\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call performAction with the GaugeController at `0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD` for the target(address) argument and using 0x3a04f900 followed by the gauge address `0x49A0e3334496442A9706E481617724e7E37EAA08` and the corresponding gauge type for the data(bytes) argument.\n\ndata(bytes) : `0x3a04f90000000000000000000000000049a0e3334496442a9706e481617724e7e37eaa080000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004`",
