        "body": "#### Introduction\n\nPolygon Labs would like Balancer to act as a delegate in the new Polygon governance system. This initiative aims to foster collaboration and leverage Balancer's expertise in technical smart contract-based governance to contribute to the Polygon ecosystem, where Balancer plays an important role as one of the largest DEXes.\n\nPolygon will soon launch the next phase of its System Smart Contracts governance, facilitated by the [Polygon Governance Hub](https://polygon.technology/blog/kicking-off-the-polygon-governance-hub-a-unified-and-transparent-interface-for-community-governance).\n\nAs part of this framework, technical community delegates are needed to help guide decision-making, particularly around Protocol Governance and System Smart Contracts (SSC) Governance.\n\n#### Motivation\n\nThe Balancer Protocol has been a pioneer in DeFi, with a well-established governance structure that emphasizes decentralization, transparency, and community involvement. By participating as a delegate in the Polygon governance system, Balancer can play a crucial role in stewarding the future of Polygon and helping to ensure robust and inclusive governance.\n\nBalancer’s participation will support the decentralization of Polygon and enhance Balancer's cross-chain presence and governance capabilities.\n\n#### Why Balancer\n\nBalancer is uniquely positioned to contribute as a delegate in the technical part of Polygon governance for several reasons:\n\n1. Expertise in Governance: Balancer has a proven track record in governance and community driven decision-making within their community.\n2. Smart Contract Upgrades: As one of the leading DeFi protocols on Polygon, Balancer has extensive experience in managing large-scale, decentralized systems and handling complex smart contract upgrades. This expertise is invaluable for contributing to discussions and decisions around Polygon protocol upgrades and SSC governance.\n3. Community Alignment: The Balancer community shares a commitment to decentralized governance and the promotion of open, transparent decision-making processes. Acting as a delegate aligns with Polygon to foster collaboration and support the broader DeFi ecosystem.\n\n#### System Overview\n\nPolygon governance is separated into [three pillars](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-governance), each of them governed in a distinct and separate fashion:\n\n* Protocol Governance facilitates ecosystem consensus and decision-making over the Polygon PoS chain via the [PIP framework](https://github.com/maticnetwork/Polygon-Improvement-Proposals) and the Polygon Protocol Governance Call, similar to Ethereum EIP governance.\n* System Smart Contracts Governance covers the shared components of Polygon networks, which are upgradeable on Ethereum, e.g., PoS staking contracts. This is the pillar where voting and delegation will soon be enabled and where Balancer would act as a delegate.\n* Community Treasury Governance is handled by the [Polygon Funding Proposal](https://github.com/0xPolygon/Polygon-Funding-Proposals/) framework and the Community Treasury Board. This is the only pillar that deals with funding distribution to the ecosystem.\n\nThe chart below describes the proposed governance flow, constituting various checks and balances, with tokenholders staked in the PoS chain serving to direct governance via their ability to signal on proposals.\n\n \n![a9e5c79bacffb20751f3d82b51ac17deae315967_2_624x444.png](ipfs://bafkreiewsgeidnyywel36cglmqmg62rcllczszykz66ieryzsfm27rfrye)\n    \n\nStaked token holders delegate votes to Polygon governance delegates, who scrutinize proposals coming from the core protocol development and research community, as well as the [Protocol Council](https://polygon.technology/blog/meet-the-polygon-protocol-council).\n\n#### Potential Contributions\n\nAs a delegate in the Polygon governance system, Balancer can offer significant contributions in the following areas:\n\n* Signal Vote: Actively engage in voting on technical Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs) discussed in the forums and Polygon governance calls, and submitted on-chain by the Protocol Council.\n* Maintain Accountability: Help ensure that the Protocol Council remains accountable, while at the same time upholding accountability to the staked tokenholders who delegate their votes to you.\n* Stay Up To Date: Engage regularly in Polygon community spaces, including the forum and Discord to stay informed and contribute to discussions.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe next chapter of Polygon governance is coming soon, and while the particular implementation will likely change over the coming months as parameters are ironed out, any community member will be able to influence the future of Polygon.\n\nBalancer’s participation as a delegate in the Polygon governance system will be mutually beneficial, enhancing collaboration between both communities.\n\nAll community members are encouraged to participate in the discussion and provide their insights and opinions on this proposal.\n\n#### Specification\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, the Balancer Foundation will act as a liaison between Polygon Governance Hub, the Balancer community and the Ecosystem-Council, by creating a delegation profile and disclosing a delegate statement, through the Foundation/OpCo executor wallet.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/384\n\n**Summary:**\n> Davos Protocol aims to establish a strong presence in both the Balancer and Ethereum ecosystems by introducing a gauge for the new DUSD/Boosted Aave v3 USD pool (Ethereum). This strategic move is intended to position the pool as the primary liquidity source for DUSD on Ethereum, while simultaneously boosting DUSD liquidity on Balancer. By channeling resources towards this specific pool, Davos Protocol aims to enhance liquidity and promote a vibrant ecosystem for both DUSD and within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website: https://davos.xyz/\n    • Documentation: https://davos.xyz/docs/\n    • Github Page: https://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts\n    • Communities: https://twitter.com/Davos_Protocol\n    • Other useful links: https://davos.xyz/assets/davos_whitepaper.pdf\n\n**Protocol Description:**\nDavos Protocol is a decentralized on-chain stablecoin protocol operating on both the Polygon Network and Ethereum Network, governed by the Davos Governance Token (DGT). It enables users to optimize the value of their crypto assets by accessing loans in DUSD stablecoin and earning competitive interest rates. The protocol prioritizes Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) as collateral, leveraging Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism for scalable crypto yield. Through collateralized reward-bearing assets, particularly LSTs, users can compound their yields and benefit from DeFi composability. The protocol redistributes DUSD yield and incentives to stakers, lenders, and liquidity providers, amplifying the benefits and utility of LST tokens within the ecosystem. Community-driven governance by DGT token holders plays a vital role in decision-making and voting.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\nDavos Protocol leverages its yield generation mechanisms to redistribute the generated yield as incentives, commonly referred to as “bribes,” to the DEX pool. To streamline this process and improve efficiency, the protocol proposes for a gauge to be in place that enables direct distribution of these incentives. As the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the pool increases, the pool receives a larger portion of incentives from Davos Protocol. This incentivizes the pool to become the primary liquidity source for the DUSD omnichain stablecoin.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** \nGovernance of the Davos Protocol is facilitated through DGT, granting holders the power to vote on protocol changes. DGT holders can propose and vote on modifications, ensuring democratic decision-making. Changes approved by the voters won’t take effect immediately, safeguarding the system against potentially harmful proposals. The Global Davos Council (GDC) is a council consisting of co-founders and advisors. The GDC serves as a governing body, providing guidance and expertise.\n\n2. **Oracles:** \nAs of now, the protocol does not rely on or utilize any oracles.\n\n3. **Audits:** \nhttps://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/blob/main/audits/Quantstamp_130223.pdf \nhttps://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/blob/main/audits/Veridise_301122.pdf\nhttps://github.com/davos-money/davos-contracts/blob/main/audits/SlowMist_310523.pdf\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** \nDUSD operates as a decentralized stablecoin and the protocol is currently managed by the core team, but the Governance Token (DGT) and veDGT model will be released to enable community governance. Liquidation can be performed by any individual.\n\n5. **Market History:**\n https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/davos-protocol/\n \n6. **Value:** \nThe pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token.\n\nPool: [0xE2D16b0A39F3FBb4389a0E8F1efCBecFB3d1E6E1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE2D16b0A39F3FBb4389a0E8F1efCBecFB3d1E6E1#readContract)\nUncapped Gauge: [0x639F4583E505e9E0A16C5D90E1AF61b47415A3A9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x639F4583E505e9E0A16C5D90E1AF61b47415A3A9#readContract)\n\n**Specification:**\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x639F4583E505e9E0A16C5D90E1AF61b47415A3A9`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/982\n\ntitle: [BIP-611] Delegate BalancerDAO ARB to karpatkey\nauthor: karpatkey\ncreated: 2024-05-15\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to delegate the [2M](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xaf23dc5983230e9eeaf93280e312e57539d098d0) ARB voting power held in the Balancer DAO treasury to karpatkey's delegation multisig. This voting power will be actively used by karpatkey in the Arbitrum governance process.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSince the passing of [[BIP-103]](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xddc174b931a0d2e5e32276a3d0d7110367797dd24248f078d0f7876d0987c92f), karpatkey has been serving as the treasury manager for Balancer DAO, a role that involves active governance interaction. In this capacity, karpatkey has engaged in governance across various protocols and chains. The Balancer DAO has recognised our expertise and commitment, selecting us through the [BIP-452](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x3a8d63ce6dbebf9b559fcd1acb367ce0c1625b805bde893b62c5a2ba2e827cbc) to be your delegate on Aave. Since December 2023, karpatkey has also been an active delegate in the Arbitrum DAO, contributing to the launch of their Arbitrum delegation [platform](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/karpatkey-delegate-communication-thread/20085).\n\nAs delegates in Arbitrum, we have [provided research](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-treasury-and-sustainability-research/20630) to the Treasury and Sustainability working group. This research presented insights into how the Arbitrum DAO could address treasury management challenges, including recommended practices, tools, or service providers the DAO should adopt. \n\nAdditionally, karpatkey serves as one of six members on the screening committee for the [Stable Treasury Endowment Program (STEP)](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x5050ef61a4cbff56344ad558c2c880b547fef3b81df607818238ed3031f840b3). This committee will oversee the review and screening of Real World Asset (RWA) service providers that are applying to STEP. This program will support the RWA ecosystem on Arbitrum by diversifying 35 million ARB from their treasury.\n\n\n## Motivation\nThis proposal aims to establish an ARB delegation, empowering karpatkey to provide enhanced support for initiatives that align the Balancer and Arbitrum ecosystems. \n\nkarpatkey, as the treasury manager for the Balancer DAO and an active delegate in Arbitrum, is not just a passive participant. With this positioning and awareness, the karpatkey team will actively and effectively represent the Balancer DAO's delegation.\n\nkarpatkey's active participation and awareness as a delegate are evident in its past initiatives. For instance, we led a proposal on behalf of the Arbitrum community on Aave, which successfully [removed ARB from isolation mode](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-remove-arb-from-isolation-mode-on-arbitrum-market/16703). This initiative was mutually beneficial for both Aave and Arbitrum, showcasing the potential for future initiatives led by karpatkey. The same can be said of the proposal led by karpatkey to [deepen the synergies between Aave and the Balancer Ecosystem](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061), which helped to make Balancer an important source of GHO's liquidity. \n\nBy delegating this voting power, karpatkey can utilise it to vote in alignment with Balancer's interests on topics such as:\n* Incentive programs;\n* Arbitrum's ARB on-chain liquidity enhancement; and\n* Arbitrum's treasury diversification strategies.\n\n## Specification\nThe Balancer treasury vault managed by karpatkey `0xaf23dc5983230e9eeaf93280e312e57539d098d0` on Arbitrum One will interact with the ARB `0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548` token contract by calling the `delegate` function, passing the karpatkey governance multisig `0x583E3EDc26E1B8620341bce90547197bfE2c1ddD` as the delegatee.\n\nThese actions will delegate the ARB voting power in the Balancer's Treasury wallet on Arbitrum One to karpatkey's governance multi-sig.\n\n### Interacted Addresses \n| Address | Description |\n| ---- | ----- \n| [0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548) | ARB Token |\n| [0xaf23dc5983230e9eeaf93280e312e57539d098d0](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xaf23dc5983230e9eeaf93280e312e57539d098d0)| Balancer Treasury (Delegator) |\n| [0x583E3EDc26E1B8620341bce90547197bfE2c1ddD](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x583E3EDc26E1B8620341bce90547197bfE2c1ddD) | karpatkey multisig (Delegatee) |\n\n\n## Disclosure\nWe have disclosed that karpatkey is the active treasury manager for Balancer DAO.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "title": "[BIP-708] Transfer stkAAVE to karpatkey-managed SAFE and Delegate Voting Power",
        "author": "0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17",
        "body": "PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1382\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal requests that BalancerDAO transfer 1,499.85 stkAAVE, resulting from [[BIP-689] Claim stkAAVe from Linear Pools](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-689-claim-stkaave-from-linear-pools/5973), to the [karpatkey-managed SAFE](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x0EFcCBb9E2C09Ea29551879bd9Da32362b32fc89). These funds will be combined with the existing stkAAVE balance and utilised for yield-generation strategies. karpatkey will present new strategies for DAO approval in the coming weeks to optimise these holdings.\n\nFurthermore, building on the precedent established in [BIP-452](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-452-delegate-balancerdao-aave-stkaave-to-karpatkey/5243), this proposal seeks authorization for karpatkey to delegate the resulting voting power to its [governance multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52), utilising the whitelisted delegation permission granted through [BIP-473](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-473-permissions-preset-update-request-2-revised-version-of-bip-442/5281#specification-4). karpatkey will actively use this delegated voting power to advocate for BalancerDAO’s interests within Aave governance.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nBeyond the inherent yield provided by stkAAVE (currently 4.85% APR), this asset presents further opportunities for yield generation. For instance, stkAAVE allows for [discounted borrowing of GHO on Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3). As of this writing, GHO borrowers with stkAAVE can borrow at a reduced rate of 3.59%, compared to the standard rate of 5.13%. karpatkey plans to present a new strategy in the coming weeks that leverages this opportunity, optimising Balancer's treasury and enhancing its yield-generation capabilities.\n\nAdditionally, stkAAVE grants voting power in Aave governance when delegated. Following the precedent of [BIP-452](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-452-delegate-balancerdao-aave-stkaave-to-karpatkey/5243), this proposal seeks authorization for karpatkey to delegate that voting power to its [governance multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52), as permitted by [BIP-473](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-473-permissions-preset-update-request-2-revised-version-of-bip-442/5281#specification-4). \n\nIt's worth noting that in September 2023, karpatkey launched a [delegation platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417/10) and became a recognized delegate for Aave. In the first two months, karpatkey actively participated in over 60 on- and off-chain votes and authored a [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061) aimed at aligning the Aave and Balancer ecosystems. In October 2023, BalancerDAO formally recognized karpatkey’s expertise and commitment, selecting us as Balancer’s delegate on Aave through [BIP-452](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x3a8d63ce6dbebf9b559fcd1acb367ce0c1625b805bde893b62c5a2ba2e827cbc).\n\nThis delegation will give karpatkey more weight to support initiatives that foster stronger alignment between the Balancer and Aave ecosystems.\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f`  will interact with the stkAAVE `0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5` token and call [transfer](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7Fc66500c84A76Ad7e9c93437bFc5Ac33E2DDaE9#writeProxyContract#F10) function, passing the karpatkey managed treasury `0x0efccbb9e2c09ea29551879bd9da32362b32fc89` as the “to” address (recipient), and 1499850055174218460000 as “amount”.\n\nUpon completion of the transfer, and based on the delegation permissions granted to the karpatkey-managed SAFE, karpatkey will delegate the voting and proposal power of the stkAAVE tokens to its [governance multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52).\n\n# Interacted Addresses\n0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5\tstkAAVE Token\n\n0x0efccbb9e2c09ea29551879bd9da32362b32fc89\tBalancer Treasury managed by karpatkey (Delegator)\n\n0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52\tkarpatkey governance multisig (Delegatee)\n\n\n\n# Disclosure\n\nWe have disclosed that karpatkey is the active treasury manager for Balancer DAO.\n\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "author": "0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516",
        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2032\n\n## Summary\n\nThis publication proposed enabling new **rETH/aWETH** gauges for Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Arbitrum, Base and Optimism.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [Rocket Pool Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool GitHub](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool)\n- [Rocket Pool Twitter](https://twitter.com/rocket_pool)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol that allows users to stake ETH and receive rETH, a liquid staking token representing their staked ETH plus accrued rewards. The protocol is designed to be community-owned, decentralized, and trustless, aligning with Ethereum's core principles.\n\nrETH accrues staking rewards over time, reflecting the performance of the underlying validators operated by a decentralized network of node operators. Users can stake as little as 0.01 ETH, making staking accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), which oversees protocol parameters and upgrades, ensuring that the protocol remains community-driven and secure.\n\nFor more details, see the [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3 with an Aave Boosted pool will enhance the capital efficiency of the rETH liquidity pools. The integration of aWETH (aArbWETH; aBasWETH, aOptWETH), which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and provides liquidity providers with additional yield opportunities.\n\nThe new **rETH/aWETH** pools will serve as the primary liquidity venue for rETH on L2s, replacing the existing v2 pool. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users interacting with Aave-based strategies.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for rETH.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), comprising RPL token holders who vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes. This decentralized governance model ensures that the protocol remains aligned with the interests of its community.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nRocket Pool utilizes a decentralized oracle network operated by the Oracle DAO (oDAO), which consists of independent node operators. These oracles are responsible for reporting validator balances and other critical data to the protocol's smart contracts, ensuring accurate and reliable operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nRocket Pool's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [Rocket Pool GitHub repository](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nRocket Pool is designed to minimize centralization risks. Governance decisions are executed by the pDAO, and the oracle network is decentralized across multiple independent operators, ensuring robust security and trustlessness throughout the protocol.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nThe existing Balancer v2 rETH/WETH pools have demonstrated strong performance, serving as a significant liquidity venue for rETH. Transitioning to a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool is expected to further enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Base](https://balancer.fi/pools/base/v2/0xc771c1a5905420daec317b154eb13e4198ba97d0000000000000000000000023)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Arbitrum](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Optimism](https://balancer.fi/pools/optimism/v2/0x4fd63966879300cafafbb35d157dc5229278ed2300020000000000000000002b)\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **rETH/aWETH** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for rETH on L2s, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aWETH. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and the ease of leveraging or unwinding on lending protocols.\n\n## Specification\n\nFollowing root gauges need to be added to the gauge controller\n\n|Chain|Pool|Pool Address|Root Gauge|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Arbitrum|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x5418a64e0cdb20548ACB394f5D00a089BAf02161|0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb|\n|Base|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0xB7B8B3AfC010169779C5C2385ec0eB0477FE3347|0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6|\n|Optimism|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x870c0Af8A1af0B58b4b0bD31CE4fe72864ae45BE|0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8|\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n\ngauge(address):`0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb` \ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum` \n\ngauge(address):`0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6` \ngaugeType(string): `Base` \n\ngauge(address):`0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8` \ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",
