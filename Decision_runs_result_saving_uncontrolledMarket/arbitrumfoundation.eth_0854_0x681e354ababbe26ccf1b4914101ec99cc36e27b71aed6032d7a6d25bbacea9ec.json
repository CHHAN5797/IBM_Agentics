        "body": "### Summary\nRage Trade is submitting an amended proposal per the [Clarified Process for Non-Council Recommended Applications](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257).\nTo recap, Rage Trade submitted [a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621) to run weekly and daily trading competitions in the LTIPP initial review round. The proposal aimed to allocate 100% of the LTIPP grant to onboard and reward users via these competitions. The focus was on trading competitions rather than fee rebates because competitions could significantly level the playing field  — ultimately boosting participation. The initial proposal was, however, declined by the council due to two issues: \n- A large ask (1.25M ARB)\n- Too few details on how wash trading risks are handled during the competition.\n\nRage Trade has now made amendments to the initial proposal, including: \n- A reduced ask of 425k ARB \n- Highlighting already existing wash trading measures, including: \n   - Enforcing a minimum trade size\n   - Calculating trader ROI based on the average collateral used during a competition round to ensure fairness between large and small traders\n\nLink to Application Revisions:\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/14\n\n### Revised feedback:\n- [GFXlabs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/15):\n> As one of the initial reviewers, we feel our concerns were addressed and would score this proposal considerably higher. The applicant correctly identified and revised the areas of the grant plan we scored as the weakest and would likely receive a passing grade from GFX if reevaluated formally.\nAs a reminder, the LTIP pilot rules did not allow applicants the ability to revise after formal submission, and so were not able to react to feedback in real time from reviewers.\nAs a second reminder, all reviewers have their own opinions and views, and may or may not overlap on some topics.\n- [404DAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/16):\n> As another reviewer of Rage Trade’s application, we also echo that our initial concerns have been addressed with these revisions. In addition to the revised grant size, Rage Trade has provided a more detailed execution plan that now includes prize distributions and the allocation breakdown between Daily & Weekly competitions. Lastly, we are pleased to see additional thought put towards preventing wash trading in the competitions.\nAs a delegate, we will be supporting this application once it goes live for a vote.\n- [Coinflip](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/17):\n> Rage Trade has been a long time integration partner of GMX supporting us with various vaults and now aggregation solutions. I’m glad to see them having taken the feedback from the LTIPP council and brought forward a much improved proposal including revised sizing.\nGlad to confirm support as a delegate for this proposal.\n\n### Key Rage Trade v2 Stats \n- **Total Volume Traded**: $500 Million \n- **Launch Date**: 30th November 2023 (~5 months since launch)\n- **Number of Perps Integrated**: Five (GMX, Hyperliquid, Aevo, dYdX, Synthetix)\n- **Number of Traders**: >3000",

The tokenization and capitalization of volatility is a novel offering enabled by DeFi and smart contract capabilities.\n\nHowever, I do wonder about the stickiness of the users they are able to attract. Much like other DeFi exotic assets and platforms Voltz Finance for example), the depth of reach for exotic DeFi assets is still outside the real of even mainstream onchain adoption. Some more background on the growth AND maturity of their current mainnet TVL has developed so the Peapods team could give more insight into potential future prospects would be helpful in their future grant endavors\n\n\n*Karel feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Peapods Finance's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal and innovative protool. Highly composable and detailed execution plan and grant justification. Since launching, has seen decent adoption on Arbitrum and continued growth on L1. Only concern is regarding the voting mechanism re: the \"\"Top 5 Voted Pods\"\" initiative but given size, not enough to disqualify.\"\t\t\n\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nPeapods Finance is a unique protocol with some interesting mechanisms. Overall, they scored well across the rubric due to their detailed execution plan, but lost a few points for the size of their ask and weak milestones. While their non-Arbitrum TVL is a little low, given the novelty of the protocol we believe this a protocol that can benefit the wider ARB ecosystem and may uniquely benefit from incentives. We will be supporting this application.",

They provided detailed explanations of their goals, KPIs, and milestones. Their requested grant size is rather large, however, given their ability to use previous grants effectively and increase TVL on Avalanche reduces some of the concerns. We also like how composable the project is which will lead to a direct boost in metrics for other protocols.\nIn contrast, we would’ve liked to have seen more data around protocol usage, user information, retention etc. \nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote AGAINST DeltaPrime's proposal.\n\nWell written proposal that scored well in the rubric (team, strategy, KPIs, milestones, composability) + painted a clear picture that they understand their users well and have a good amount of insight from prior incentive programs they've run (re: points system). The large requested grant size relative to their activity on Arbitrum, the set goals of ~6x-ing TVL within a quarter, and lack of clarity on retention (to support their claim of TVL not flowing out of Prime Accounts for instance re: stickiness) brings pause.\n\nSuggest they resubmit in a future grants window with a lower amount (ie. 500k ARB / $50M TVL) after showing more PMF within Arbitrum and integration of other protocols.\n\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nDeltaprime presented a very thorough application. Their organic metrics were quite impressive and the had strong justifications behind their grant ask. We appreciate their ability to incorporate learnings from past incentives and implement desired changes into this program. Overall, we felt the application was heavily tailored to enabling growth on Arbitrum and we will be supporting this proposal.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nBased on the detailed information provided, the proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to leverage the DeltaPrime protocol to encourage growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The protocol has already demonstrated success on Avalanche and Arbitrum, with a track record of high TVL and user engagement. The proposed grant will further incentivize liquidity provision and borrowing activities, driving TVL growth and deepening liquidity across partner protocols. The use of milestones, speed bonuses, and retention incentives ensures user engagement and stickiness, while the multi-chain integration through the LiFi bridge enhances accessibility and attracts capital from other networks. With a robust security infrastructure, clear objectives, and well-defined KPIs, the proposal exhibits a strategic approach to achieving its goals and contributing significantly to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. We would approve this proposal.",

They provide clear and concise explanations of their milestones, KPIs, and objectives.\nTheir product is innovative and unique and attempts to solve a major problem for one of the largest DeFi categories. We really like their esARB mechanism which should create a notable amount of supply side benefits post LTIPP. Their execution strategy is sound and their TVL estimations and calculations are sufficiently justified.\nUnfortunately, they are a niche product that is complex and may not appeal to a lot of users which is indicated in their lack of adoption. Nonetheless, there still seems to be some baseline of activity.\nTheir requested grant size is on the larger end for their protocol usage, however, given the points above we think it’s sufficiently justified.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis application largely suffered from being a very large request relative to the TVL and age of the protocol. It would also have benefited from more details around under what conditions or guidelines the incentives would be deployed, as they currently appear to be very discretionary for the applicant. Recommend the applicant resubmit in future grants cycles once there is more history and an initial success to build upon using grant funding.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nGammaSwap presented a strong application, scoring well across most of the rubric. We did feel the grant ask was a little high relative to their TVL, but given the uniqueness to their product we can understand how the protocol may not attract your everyday user. Given the strength and justification of their execution strategy, KPIs, and milestones we are supportive of this proposal to move to a DAO vote.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR GammaSwap's proposal.\n\nGood proposal that scored well across the rubric which sufficient justifications around the grant size, the approach to executing against the plan, and maintaining results after LTIPP. Novel and innovative protocol that provides some degree of differentiation in contrast to the market which supports some of the stickiness considerations. They've demonstrated modest traction and adoption on Arbitrum to \"test the waters\" without incentives, and while the grant size requested is on the higher end in contrast to their TVL (~1-2 thirds of it), believe this is a worthwhile investment from the DAO to scale up adoption based on initial results.",
