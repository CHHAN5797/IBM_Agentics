        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Finance Steward\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-05-03\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nBuilding upon the success of the [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-risk-steward-phase-1-capsplusrisksteward/12602), this publication proposes creating a smart contract to enable \"Finance Stewards\" to execute on behalf of the DAO pre-approved and budgeted operations.\n\nThis proposal also marks a step forward in defining the asset management framework for Aave DAO, as introduced in the TokenLogic and karpatkey service provider [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).\n\n# Motivation\n\nTo progressively streamline the management of the Aave DAO's funds by shifting approved ARFC proposals from on-chain vote to a trusted Finance Steward implementation.\n\nThe Finance Steward is a smart contract that will act as admin of the collector, it can do the exact same operations as the DAO Executor. The DAO has full ownership of the contract which grants it the ability to delegate permissions and budget specific actions to a Guardian, the Finance team. \n\nThe Finance Steward will enable the DAO to define a core set of financial capabilities to be carried out within strict role-based guardrails. As the role matures or new use cases arise, we plan to bring forward additional capabilities for the DAO to discuss.\n\nEfforts not included in the Finance Steward or being developed will still be covered through the normal governance process. This may include the recommendation to introduce purpose-specific safe multisigs with the intent to minimise governance burden (e.g. ALC, APE, etc…).  This design will map frequent key finance operations to a role-based governance-controlled solution, frequent but long-tail use cases to trust-minimised and efficient multisigs; and important, infrequent or strategic discussions to the full governance process.\n\n\nIt is relatively simple for the Aave DAO to grant granular control over the management of various parameters to Finance Stewards, but the complexity comes in term of decentralisation and self-protection of the protocol.\n\nThe initial introduction of the Finance Steward role will enable the tasks detailed in the Specifications to be performed. \n\n# Specification\n\n## Finance Steward v1.0 (Mainnet Only)\n\nThe initial Finance Steward implementation will work the following way:\n\n* A `FinanceSteward` smart contract will be created with an Owner and a Guardian. The Owner will be the DAO.\n* Guardian of the FinanceSteward contract will be a multisig with multiple signers, to be determined by the DAO.\n* The Collector Contract will be upgraded to have a system of roles whereby the same admin role can be held by multiple addresses, eg: FUNDS_ADMIN by the DAO's Executor and the FINANCE_STEWARD by the multisig proposed earlier.\n* Guardian can migrate assets from v2 and deposit into v3 to support seamless migration of the DAOs assets over time.\n* Guardian can be granted the ability to use the Aave Swapper to exchange assets held in the Treasury\n* Guardian can withdraw and deposit into V3.\n* Guardian can be granted the ability to transfer and stream tokens to pre-approved addresses within a budget, for example:\n    * ACI [Frontier](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-introducing-frontier-staking-as-a-service-for-the-aave-dao/16225) Program\n    * ACI [Merit](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-a-new-aave-alignment-user-reward-system/16646) Program\n\nThe functionality will have the following limitations, enforced on-chain:\n\n* For each Aave market reserve, a [minimum balance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aaysvP2velw0hCBhH3huplumNwuN0FaA_bAZZTdjsmg/edit?usp=sharing) will remain in the collector\n* Tokens to swap to will be pre-approved by the DAO\n* Addresses to transfer to will be pre-approved\n* Tokens to transfer out of the Collector have a pre-defined budget set by the DAO\n\n## Future Phased Functionality Introduction\n\nThe following permissioned functionality is intended to be gradually introduced over time to further streamline the implementation of the DAO's financial transactions.\n\n* AAVE Protocol interactions in cross-chain deployments\n* Bridging from and to other chains\n\nSome of the above updates are pending other contracts to be delivered.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

As Aave continues its growth across new ecosystems, it presents a strategic opportunity to extend GHO’s reach alongside it. Sonic’s DeFi sector is currently thriving, and with Aave set to launch on Sonic in the coming weeks, deploying GHO there would be a natural next step.\n\nSonic’s current growth is largely driven by the anticipation of its [upcoming airdrop](https://docs.soniclabs.com/funding/sonic-airdrop), scheduled for June. Users earn points while protocols accumulate gems based on their activity within the ecosystem.\n\nA key part of the early GHO growth strategy on Sonic will be securing liquidity in an Aave Boosted StableSurge Pool on Beethoven, a friendly fork of Balancer v3. This integration enables idle liquidity to be automatically redeployed into Aave to maximize capital efficiency. Additionally, as part of Aave’s collaboration with Balancer, these pools will receive further support, with Beethoven allocating a portion of their “gems” rewards to incentivize GHO liquidity.\n\nJust as with the Base deployment, a well-coordinated strategy is crucial for GHO’s expansion to Sonic. A successful launch will require close collaboration among service providers to build a strong infrastructure, establish appropriate risk parameters, and solidify GHO’s role as a key stablecoin within Sonic’s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis ARFC vote seeks community consensus to move forward with GHO’s deployment on Sonic, paving the way for its continued multichain growth and deeper integration across emerging ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposed deployment of GHO on Sonic will require coordination across several key components:\n\n|Service Provider|Responsibility|\n| --- | --- |\n|Aave Labs + BGD + Certora|Deploy CCIP & Aave Protocol Updates|\n|TokenLogic|Deploy Facilitator, GSM & GHO Steward Updates|\n|Chaos Labs + Risk Llama|GSM, CCIP & Aave Protocol Parameters|\n|ACI + TokenLogic|Incentive Program & Distribution|\n|Aave Liquidity Committee|DEX Liquidity|\n|Gho Stewards|Maintain Risk Parameters|\n\nACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe final timeline and technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and outlined in subsequent AIPs, pending approval of this ARFC.\n\n## Aave Protocol - GHO Reserve Parameters\n\n> Updated proposal 2025-03-15 with Chaos feedback\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Asset|GHO|\n|Market|Sonic|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap|2,500,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,250,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|-|\n|LT|-|\n|Liquidation Bonus|-|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|-|\n|Variable Base|0%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.5%|\n|Variable Slope2|50%|\n|Uoptimal|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|N/A|\n\n## Ethereum <> Sonic Facilitator\n\nA facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum specifically to support Sonic.\n\nGHO is considered to have entered circulating supply when users exchange USDC.e for GHO via the stataUSDC.e GSM on Sonic.\n\nThe initial configuration for the Sonic GhoDirectMinter facilitator as shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Mint Cap|10M Units|\n\nThis is to be implemented by setting the `newFacilitatorBucketCapacity` to to 10M.\n\nReference: [GhoDirectMinter](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-ghodirectminter/20040)\n\n## CCIP Configuration\n\nTo support the launch of GHO on Sonic, the following parameter adjustments are proposed:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Bucket Capacity|+15M Units|\n|Rate Limit Capacity|1,000,000 units|\n|Refill Rate|200 GHO/sec|\n\nThe Bucket increase is additional to the Bucket Capacity at the time to ensure the GSM can be supplied with GHO.\n\nThis is expected to support strong initial growth with the DAO and other expected to be moving large amounts of GHO through the bridge.\n\nReference: [GHO Deployment](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=240)\n\n## GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the stataUSDC.e GSM to be deployed on Sonic.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|GHO Bucket Cap|10.00M|\n|USDC Exposure Cap|5.00M|\n|Freeze Lower Bound|$0.990|\n|Freeze Upper Bound|$1.010|\n|Unfreeze Lower Bound|$0.995|\n|Unfreeze Upper Bound|$1.005|\n|Mint GHO Fee|0.00%|\n|Burn GHO Fee|0.00%|\n\nWith GHO being minted on Ethereum and being transferred to the GSM, the Mint() function on the Ethereum instance of stataGSM is to be replaced by Transfer() functionality. Pre-minted GHO held by the stataGSM on Sonic is to be transferred when USDC is received.\n\n### stataUSDC Revenue\n\nA bot, deployed as part of Dolce Vita will periodically claim the revenue to the DAO's treasury.\n\n### GHO Stewards\n\n**GhoAaveSteward**\n\n* `updateGhoBorrowCap`\n* * The update changes up to 100% upwards and downwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n* `updateGhoBorrowRate`\n* * The update changes up to 5.0% (configurable by the DAO) upwards or downwards the following four variables:\n    * optimalUsageRatio\n    * baseVariableBorrowRate\n    * variableRateSlope1\n    * variableRateSlope2\n  * The initially allowed amount of change for these variables is 5%, but is configurable by the DAO\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n* `updateGhoSupplyCap`\n* * The update changes up to 100% upwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n**GhoGsmSteward**\n\n* `updateGsmExposureCap`\n* * The update changes up to 100% upwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n* `updateGsmBuySellFees`\n* * The update changes up to 0.5% upwards or downwards (in both buy and sell individually)\n  * Asumes that strategy is FixedFeeStrategy created by `FixedFeeStrategyFactory`\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n## Budget\n\nCreate an Allowance for GHO on Ethereum for a total of 1,000,000 GHO from Sonic instance to support the initial growth of GHO on Sonic.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: 0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b\n\nAcquire GHO and deposit into Sonic instance:\n\nEthereum\naEthUSDT (1.00M)\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe ACI & TokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

There are additional small  treasury management actions included in this proposal for house-keeping.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming launch of the Merit program and the expected renewal of DAO service providers, this proposal intends to:\n\n* Consolidate the DAOs smaller holdings to GHO\n* Swap larger stablecoins holdings for GHO\n* Replenish the stablecoins Reserves in Aave v3\n* Migrate funds from Aave v2 to v3\n* Bridge funds from Polygon to Mainnet\n\nTo reduce governance burden, this proposal also includes withdrawing BAL and CRV from mainnet Aave v3 and v2, as well as withdrawing and bridging them from Polygon Aave v3 to Ethereum. All the BAL and CRV included in this proposal will then be transferred to the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) for its future allocation on behalf of the DAO.\n\nIn addition to the above, this proposal seeks to enable @karpatkey_TokenLogic to submit proposals via the Direct-to-AIP process which include actions similar to the above:\n\n* Consolidate treasury holdings to GHO \n* Migrate funds from v2 to v3 deployments\n* Move funds from Polygon to Ethereum\n\n# Specification\n\nThe table below summarises the tasks to be performed by this proposal:\n\n### Part A\n\nPart A, or the first AIP resulting from this proposal seeks alignment to perform the following actions:\n\n| Withdraw & Swap to GHO | Migrate ETH v2 to v3| Polygon to ETH|\n| ---              | ---          | ---              |\n| aEthLUSD (All-1) | awBTC (All-1)| aPolwETH (All-1) |\n| aEthUSDC (1.25M) | awETH (All-1)| aPolDAI (All-1)  |\n| aEthUSDT (1.5M)  | aUSDC (300k) | aPolBAL (All-1)  |\n| LUSD (All)       |              | aPolCRV (All-1)  |\n| aLUSD (All-1)    |              |                  |\n| aBUSD (50k)      |              |                  |\n| aTUSD (All-1)    |              |                  |\n| aFRAX (All-1)     |              |                  |\n| aUSDT (200k)     |              |                  |\n| aDAI (All-1)     |              |                  |\n| aDPI  (All-1)    |              |                  |\n\nWithdraw aCRV, aEthCRV, aBAL and aEthBAL and transfer BAL and CRV to ALC SAFE.\n\nEnable @karpatkey_Tokenlogic so submit funding proposals consisting of the following via the Direct-to-AIP process:\n\n1) Consolidate the treasury to GHO\n2) Migrate funds from v2 to v3 on respective networks\n3) Move funds from Polygon to Ethereum\n\n### Part B\n\nAs part of the second AIP resulting from this ARFC, the following actions are included:\n\n| Transfer ALC     | Deposit ETH v3  |Swap to GHO|\n| ---              | ---             |---        |\n| BAL              | ETH (All-1)     | aBUSD     |\n| CRV              | DAI (All)       |           |\n\nWithdraw and swap remaining BUSD from Aave v2 (assuming there is enough on-chain liquidity)\n\nALC SAFE:`0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy stataUSDC GSM on Base\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2025-02-05\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying a stataUSDC GHO Stability Module (GSM) on Base supported by a facilitator on Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal recommends deploying a GSM on Base to enhance GHO's price stability during market fluctuations and facilitate new circulating supply issuance.\n\nIntroducing a GSM shortly after launch will help mitigate volatility caused by thin secondary market liquidity while providing users with an alternative way to acquire GHO. Given the various yield opportunities for GHO on Base, limited supply could push GHO above $1.00, as seen during its launch on Arbitrum.\n\nDeploying a stataUSDC GSM would allow users to exchange USDC for GHO, with USDC deposited into Aave Protocol. Each unit of GHO transferred to a user increases the circulating supply, helping to balance market demand.\n\nThe chart below compares USDC deposit rates across Aave v3 instances on Ethereum Core, Arbitrum, and Base. Notably, the USDC deposit APY on Base closely aligns with that of Ethereum Core.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 16.41.37](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ8A4MbFkg.png)\n\nAll GHO issued by the GSM is backed 1:1, ensuring GHO is always over-collateralised.\n\nThe Aave DAO will receive the following revenue streams from the aUSDC GSM:\n\n* Swap Fees;\n* Surplus aToken Yield; and,\n* Any incentives distributed to USDC deposit on Aave v3.\n\nThe aToken yield acts as a proxy for the GHO Borrow Rate. GHO issued by the GSM generates aUSDC yield and GHO Borrowed on Aave v3 generates interest. \n\nThe aUSDC revenue is available every block as it accrues, which is unlike the interest accruing from GHO debt that is only received when a user's loan is repaid.\n\n# Specification\n\n![IMG_6164.PNG|1920x1042](upload://zXNHS4ODhgvChU0vLGVhdcHs4iz.jpeg)\n\nThis instance of the GSM enables users to exchange GHO and USDC at a 1:1 fixed-ratio, with surplus USDC used to mint stataUSDC tokens to earn yield. \n\nThe GSM can mint and burn stataUSDC in exchange for USDC based upon user demand. \n\n![IMG_6150.PNG|1920x1371](upload://7LMwHDLRsayPDz1PS0Qn3W3RLb4.jpeg)\n\nThe ARFC shall incorporate feedback from the community and service providers and detail the final configuration setup before the Snapshot is submitted.\n\n## Ethereum <> Base Facilitator\n\nA facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum specifically to support Base. GHO is considered to have entered circulating supply when users exchange USDC for GHO via the GSM on Base. \n\nThe initial configuration for the Base GhoDirectMinter facilitator as shown below:\n\n| Parameter  |     Value      | \n|    ---     |     :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |   10M Units    | \n\nThis is to be implemented by setting the `newFacilitatorBucketCapacity` to to 10M.\n\nReference: [GhoDirectMinter](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-ghodirectminter/20040)\n\n## CCIP Configuration \n\nWith the launch of GHO on Base now at AIP voting stage, the CCIP Bucket Capacity will be increased by 10M units, matching the GHO supplied to the GSM. \n\n| Paramater | Current | Proposed |\n| --------- | :-----: | :------: |\n| GHO_Bucket_Capacity | 20M | 30M |\n\nThis publication does not include any changes the CCIP Rate Limit Capacity (300,000) and Refill Rate (60/sec).\n\nReference: [GHO Deployment](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=240)\n\n## GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the stataUSDC GSM to be deployed on Base. \n\n| Parameter                | Value  | \n| ------------------------ | :----: | \n| GHO Bucket Cap           | 10.00M |\n| USDC Exposure Cap        | 10.00M |\n| Freeze Lower Bound       | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound       | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee             |  0.00% |\n| Burn GHO Fee             |  0.00% | \n\nWith GHO being minted on Ethereum and being transferred to the GSM, the Mint() function on the Ethereum instance of stataGSM is to be replaced by Transfer() functionality. Pre-minted GHO held by the stataGSM on Base is to be transferred when USDC is received. \n\n## GHO Steward\n\nA new GhoGsmSteward role shall be deployed on Base enabling the GHO Stewards to tailor the GSM configuration to reflect the prevailing market conditions.\n\nReference: [GHO Steward v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-steward-v2-upgrade/19116) \n\n## stataUSDC Revenue\n\nA bot, deployed as part of Dolce Vita will periodically claim the revenue to the DAO's treasury.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the AIP stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] GHO Steward v2 Upgrade\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-09-19\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes upgrading the GHO Steward Role to incorporate additional functionality to accomodate the current and future growth of GHO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn response to the expanding GHO ecosystem, GhoSteward v2 incorporates several different stewards to avoid the need to redeploy the entire steward contract whenever an upgrade or change is proposed. \n\n* GhoBucketSteward\n* GhoAaveSteward\n* GhoCcipSteward\n* GhoGsmSteward\n\nAny future change to the GHO Steward functionality will require only the corresponding steward to be updated. This reduces the complexity and streamlines future amendments to the GHO Steward role.\n\nIn addition, some new features have been added to allow for controlling parameters related to CCIP.\n\nThe below outlines the functionality of the new GHO Steward role:\n\n## GhoBucketSteward\n* `updateFacilitatorBucketCapacity`\n  * The update changes up to 100% upwards\n  * Facilitator must be in controlled list\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n## GhoAaveSteward\n* `updateGhoBorrowCap`\n  * The update changes up to 100% upwards and downwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n* `updateGhoBorrowRate`\n  * The update changes up to 5.0% (configurable by the DAO) upwards or downwards the following four variables:\n    * optimalUsageRatio\n    * baseVariableBorrowRate\n    * variableRateSlope1\n    * variableRateSlope2\n * The initially allowed amount of change for these variables is 5%, but is configurable by the DAO\n    * Max value for borrow rate is 25.0%\n    * Note that this is enforced by GHO_BORROW_RATE_MAX and is an absolute max on the final value, whereas the other update conditions enforce how much a value is allowed to change on each individual update (and there is no enforced maximum value)\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n* `updateGhoSupplyCap`\n  * The update changes up to 100% upwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n## GhoCcipSteward\n\n* `updateBridgeLimit`\n  * The update changes up to 100% upwards or downwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n* `updateRateLimit`\n  * The update changes up to 100% upwards or downwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n## GhoGsmSteward\n\n* `updateGsmExposureCap`\n  * The update changes up to 100% upwards\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n* `updateGsmBuySellFees`\n  * The update changes up to 0.5% upwards or downwards (in both buy and sell individually)\n  * Asumes that strategy is FixedFeeStrategy created by `FixedFeeStrategyFactory`\n  * Only callable by the GHO Steward\n\n## Management of the GHO Steward Permissions\n\nThe following functions can only be called by the owner (the Aave DAO)\n\n* `setControlledFacilitator` on `GhoBucketSteward`\n  * Only callable by the Aave DAO\n* `setRiskConfig` on GhoAaveSteward\n  * Sets the max percent changes for each of the four required parameters for Gho borrow rate (optimal usage ratio, base variable borrow rate, variable slope rate 1 and 2)\n  * Only callable by the Aave DAO\n\nFurther details relating to GhoSteward v2 can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/pull/414).\n\n## GHO Stewards\n\nThe below provides a recap of the current GHO Stewards for completeness. \n\n* @karpatkey - @Sisyphos\n* @ACI - @MarcZeller\n* @ChaosLabs \n* @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham\n\nThe SAFE is configured to have 3 of 4 signer requirement.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following contracts must be granted these roles by the DAO:\n\n* GhoAaveSteward\n  * RiskAdmin in Aave V3 Ethereum Pool\n* GhoBucketSteward (both on Ethereum and Arbitrum)\n  * GhoTokenBucketManagerRole on GhoToken\n* GhoCcipSteward\n  * RateLimitAdmin and BridgeLimitAdmin roles on GhoTokenPool (just rateLimitAdmin on Arbitrum)\n* GhoGsmSteward\n  * Configurator in every GSM asset that the DAO wants the risk council to manage\n\nTo facilitate the CCIP Steward, a new CCIP token pool implementation will be implemented on Arbitrum to allow setting of rateLimitAdmin.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will be submitted for community vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
