Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by centralized reserves, USDN employs a delta-neutral strategy through a structured product mechanism. This approach balances long and short positions within the protocol to stabilize USDN's value and generate returns for participants.\n\nKey features of USDN include:\n\n- **Decentralization**: Operates entirely on-chain without reliance on centralized entities.\n- **Yield Generation**: Utilizes a rebase mechanism to distribute yields directly to holders' wallets.\n- **Delta-Neutral Strategy**: Maintains stability by balancing leveraged long positions against the vault's holdings.\n- **No Custodial Risk**: Users interact directly with smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntegrating USDN with aGHO in a Balancer v3 Composable Stable pool offers several advantages:\n\n- **Enhanced Capital Efficiency**: aGHO, being GHO deposited into Aave's Prime instance, accrues native yield, reducing the need for additional incentives.\n- **Strengthened Liquidity**: Establishes a primary liquidity venue for USDN, promoting seamless integrations with DeFi protocols utilizing aGHO.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader integrations across DeFi for USDN.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nSmarDex uses \"Privileged functions\" which allow Multisigs to have an overview about all important functions of the protocol. \n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nThe USDN protocol relies on a dual-oracle system, utilizing both Pyth and Chainlink, to obtain accurate price feeds. This redundancy ensures resilience against potential oracle failures and maintains the integrity of the protocol's operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nSmarDex's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral/risks).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nThere is no governance; the team manages all operations. Some contracts are renounced, while others are controlled by a 3/5 multisig\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nAs a new Balancer v3 pool, the USDN/aGHO pair aims to establish itself as a significant liquidity venue for USDN. The integration with Aave's aGHO token is expected to enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **USDN/aGHO** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for USDN, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize GHO. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and expanding USDN's utility across the Ethereum ecosystem. With GHO being the cornerstone asset for swap in Balancer v3 it will ensure efficient swap throughout the DEX.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: 0x950682e741abd1498347a93b942463af4ec7132b\n- Gauge: 0x9798995a042973d9705a4f0fea691a4541d13b43\n- GaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

The protocol employs a dual-token system comprising USDf and sUSDf, where USDf serves as the foundational unit of account, and sUSDf is a yield-bearing token obtained by staking USDf.\n\nUSDf maintains its peg through a combination of delta-neutral trading strategies and cross-market arbitrage opportunities, ensuring stability even during market turbulence. The protocol supports multiple minting mechanisms, including Classic Mint and Innovative Mint, catering to various user risk profiles and strategies.\n\nFalcon Finance operates with a focus on sustainable yield generation, making it a robust solution for users seeking stable, on-chain liquidity without relinquishing exposure to their underlying assets.\n\nFor more details, see the [Falcon Finance Documentation](https://docs.falcon.finance/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning to a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool for USDf/aGHO will significantly enhance capital efficiency and yield opportunities for liquidity providers. The integration of aGHO, which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and provides additional yield streams.\n\nThe new **USDf/aGHO** pool will serve as the primary liquidity venue for USDf on Balancer, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aGHO. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users interacting with Aave-based strategies.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for USDf, solidifying its role within the synthetic dollar ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nFalcon Finance's governance framework is designed to ensure transparency and community involvement. While TGE has not happened yet, the core team is shipping fast and efficiently at the moment and will update the governance framework when the token is live.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nUSDf has its own [Chainlink data feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/usdf-usd) and has permissioned mint and redemption processes to protect the peg.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nFalcon Finance's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [Falcon Finance Documentation](https://docs.falcon.finance/).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nFalcon Finance is designed to minimize centralization risks. \n\n### 5. Market History\n\nAs a new Balancer v3 pool, the USDf/aGHO pair aims to establish itself as a significant liquidity venue for USDf. The integration with Aave's aGHO token is expected to enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n### 6.

It enables users to not only stake but also farm, restake, and borrow against their staked assets.\n\nStakeWise V3 introduces a permissionless staking marketplace that allows users to choose their own node operators, optimize staking profits, minimize slashing risk, and even operate their own Vaults. Vaults are isolated, trustless staking pools that offer fully customizable staking terms, ensuring a tailored and secure staking experience for individuals, DAOs, and institutions alike.\n\nAt the core of StakeWise V3 is osETH â€” a liquid staking token that offers in-built slashing protection and accrues rewards from a highly diversified network of validators. osETH minting is dependent on the Vaultâ€™s LTV ratio, with standard Vaults allowing minting up to 90% of the staked ETH value, and DAO-approved Vaults offering up to 99.99% LTV, backed by stringent requirements and a 5M SWISE bond for enhanced security.\n\nStakeWise DAO, governed by SWISE token holders, oversees protocol parameters, operator standards, and Treasury management, ensuring that the protocol remains community-driven and secure.\n\nFor more details, see the [StakeWise Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/).\n\n# Motivation\n\nTokenLogic has been working with StakeWise to adopt an Aave Boosted pool upong migration liquidity from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3. The new Aave Boosted Pool will significantly enhance the capital efficiency of the osETH liquidity pool and provide liquidity providers access to yield from Aave. \n\nThe new **osETH/aWETH** pool will replace the existing v2 pool as the primary liquidity venue for osETH. The new Aave Boosted pools will offer superior capital efficiency with WETH deposits earning yield from Aave and greater liquidity concentration, from a higher Amplification factor, is expected to enhance liquidity depth, thereby providing a better user experience whilst also generating a cost savigns for StakeWise. \n\nA gauge is critical to bootstrap TVL, strengthen liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for osETH, helping it become a core building block for staking-related strategies across the ecosystem.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## 1. Governance\n\nThe StakeWise protocol is governed by the StakeWise DAO, with all decision-making power vested in SWISE token holders. Protocol upgrades that involve upgradable contracts must undergo a community vote, followed by multisig approval, ensuring a transparent and decentralized governance process. Core infrastructure components, such as the osETH token contracts, are immutable, providing additional security and resilience to the protocol.\n\n## 2. Oracles\n\nStakeWise leverages a decentralized and independent oracle network consisting of 11 established staking service providers. These operators are bound by service-level agreements (SLAs) and are responsible for accurately and reliably reporting validator balances to the protocolâ€™s smart contracts, ensuring transparency and operational integrity. [More information here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oracles).\n\n## 3. Audits\n\nStakeWise V3 has been audited by **Halborn**, **Sigma Prime** and Consensys. All the audits can be found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits).\n\n## 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nStakeWise is designed to minimize centralization risks. Governance decisions are executed fully on-chain by SWISE token holders, while the oracle network is decentralized across multiple independent and reputable staking operators, ensuring robust security and trustlessness at every layer of the protocol.\n\n## 5. Market History\n\nThis is a new Balancer v3 pool specifically created to provide osETH liquidity paired with aWETH (Aave-wrapped WETH). The V2 pool has been doing great for the past two years and has grown to be one of the biggest Balancer pool by TVL.\ncf: [Balancer V2 Pool, Eth](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635)\n\n## 6. Value\n\nThe **osETH/aWETH** pool will serve as the primary liquidity hub for osETH, enabling seamless integrations with major DeFi protocols that use aWETH as a base asset. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical to facilitating efficient swaps and expanding osETHâ€™s utility.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Enable Gauges\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig '0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860' will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at '0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd' and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: 0x1a36195044abbad8807ceea78ec645c0c5d09593\n- Gauge(address): 0x0fc6169f74b1d0bbe7a269c1ee8d92edb58b1ade\n- GaugeType(string): Arbitrum\n\nMaxi Edits:\n\n* added pool address\n* added gauge address\n* add payload",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2091\n\n**Note:** ([This](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-837-enable-wusdn-bold-stable-pool-gauge-on-balancer-v3-ethereum/6545) proposal has been reposted, as the previous one contained the old BOLD token)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to activate a gauge for the wUSDN/BOLD Stable Pool on Balancer v3 Mainnet, enabling liquidity mining incentives liquidity providers.\n\nReferences/Useful Links\n\nSmardex\n\n* [Smardex Website]()\n* [Smardex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/)\n* [Smardex GitHub](https://github.com/smardex-ecosystem)\n* [Smardex Twitter]()\n\nLiquity\n\n* [Liquity Website](https://www.liquity.org/)\n* [Liquity Documentation](https://docs.liquity.org/)\n* [Liquity GitHub](https://github.com/liquity/bold/)\n* [Liquity Twitter](https://x.com/LiquityProtocol)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nSmarDex introduces USDN, a fully decentralized synthetic dollar designed to maintain a stable value around $1 while providing yield to its holders. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by centralized reserves, USDN employs a delta-neutral strategy through a structured product mechanism. This approach balances long and short positions within the protocol to stabilize USDNâ€™s value and generate returns for participants.\n\n## Key features of USDN include:\n\n* Decentralization: Operates entirely on-chain without reliance on centralized entities.\n\n* Yield Generation: Utilizes a rebase mechanism to distribute yields directly to holdersâ€™ wallets.\n\n* Delta-Neutral Strategy: Maintains stability by balancing leveraged long positions against the vaultâ€™s holdings.\n\n* No Custodial Risk: Users interact directly with smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\n\n**For more details, refer to the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral).**\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe creation of a Balancer v3 gauge for the wUSDN/BOLD pool will significantly deepen BOLD liquidity and introduce a dual-yield opportunity for LPsâ€”combining wUSDNâ€™s high native yield with BAL emissions. This pool will serve as the primary venue for BOLD <> wUSDN swaps, supporting broader DeFi integrations and composability for both tokens.\n\nBy referencing the detailed [SMARDEX BOLD Liquidity Initiative](https://your-link-here/), this proposal aims to align incentives between protocols, bootstrap TVL, and showcase innovative cross-protocol treasury management using LQTY governance and Smardexâ€™s native incentives.\n\nA gauge is essential to attract deep, sustainable liquidity and accelerate adoption for BOLD and wUSDN across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\n1. Governance\n\n* Smardex\n  * There is no governance for now.\n  * For USDN, some contracts are renounced.\n  * The remaining contracts are managed by a 3/5 multisig controlled internally by the team\n* Liquity\n  * There is no on-chain governance for Liquity v2.\n  * Master contracts are deployed without the possibility of modification (immutable/renounced).\n  * Upgrades or parameter changes are not possible, which limits the risk of centralization and human intervention.\n\n2.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2032\n\n## Summary\n\nThis publication proposed enabling new **rETH/aWETH** gauges for Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Arbitrum, Base and Optimism.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [Rocket Pool Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool GitHub](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool)\n- [Rocket Pool Twitter](https://twitter.com/rocket_pool)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol that allows users to stake ETH and receive rETH, a liquid staking token representing their staked ETH plus accrued rewards. The protocol is designed to be community-owned, decentralized, and trustless, aligning with Ethereum's core principles.\n\nrETH accrues staking rewards over time, reflecting the performance of the underlying validators operated by a decentralized network of node operators. Users can stake as little as 0.01 ETH, making staking accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), which oversees protocol parameters and upgrades, ensuring that the protocol remains community-driven and secure.\n\nFor more details, see the [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3 with an Aave Boosted pool will enhance the capital efficiency of the rETH liquidity pools. The integration of aWETH (aArbWETH; aBasWETH, aOptWETH), which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and provides liquidity providers with additional yield opportunities.\n\nThe new **rETH/aWETH** pools will serve as the primary liquidity venue for rETH on L2s, replacing the existing v2 pool. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users interacting with Aave-based strategies.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for rETH.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), comprising RPL token holders who vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes. This decentralized governance model ensures that the protocol remains aligned with the interests of its community.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nRocket Pool utilizes a decentralized oracle network operated by the Oracle DAO (oDAO), which consists of independent node operators. These oracles are responsible for reporting validator balances and other critical data to the protocol's smart contracts, ensuring accurate and reliable operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nRocket Pool's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [Rocket Pool GitHub repository](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nRocket Pool is designed to minimize centralization risks. Governance decisions are executed by the pDAO, and the oracle network is decentralized across multiple independent operators, ensuring robust security and trustlessness throughout the protocol.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nThe existing Balancer v2 rETH/WETH pools have demonstrated strong performance, serving as a significant liquidity venue for rETH. Transitioning to a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool is expected to further enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Base](https://balancer.fi/pools/base/v2/0xc771c1a5905420daec317b154eb13e4198ba97d0000000000000000000000023)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Arbitrum](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Optimism](https://balancer.fi/pools/optimism/v2/0x4fd63966879300cafafbb35d157dc5229278ed2300020000000000000000002b)\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **rETH/aWETH** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for rETH on L2s, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aWETH. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and the ease of leveraging or unwinding on lending protocols.\n\n## Specification\n\nFollowing root gauges need to be added to the gauge controller\n\n|Chain|Pool|Pool Address|Root Gauge|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Arbitrum|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x5418a64e0cdb20548ACB394f5D00a089BAf02161|0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb|\n|Base|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0xB7B8B3AfC010169779C5C2385ec0eB0477FE3347|0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6|\n|Optimism|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x870c0Af8A1af0B58b4b0bD31CE4fe72864ae45BE|0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8|\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n\ngauge(address):`0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb` \ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum` \n\ngauge(address):`0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6` \ngaugeType(string): `Base` \n\ngauge(address):`0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8` \ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",
