This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration, focusing on three primary axes: Skyward, Growth, and Representation.\n\n### Skyward:\n\n![image|2000x559](upload://22rgZUXRYxc6uOrlNotwo8BiZ6l.png)\n\n\nSkyward has emerged as a cornerstone of Aave's governance, producing 90 AIPs in 180 days. This averages out to **[one AIP every other day](https://dune.com/alice_rozengarden/aip-creation-in-2023)**, a testament to the relentless dedication and efficiency of the ACI. Beyond numbers, the ACI has fostered a spirit of collaboration within the Aave ecosystem.\n\nWe've co-authored proposals with the vast majority of active DAO service providers, recognized delegates and some active community members. Moreover, our doors have always been open to third-party protocols. By actively welcoming and collaborating with them, we've streamlined the governance process, ensuring that Aave remains inclusive and cohesive in its approach.\n\n**What to expect for phase II?**\n\nContinuation & extension of the Skyward services.\n\n### Growth:\n\n![image|2000x1088](upload://qjlOWocj80wUPeSHio06wG9yJBp.jpeg)\n\n\nThe ACI operates under a guiding principle of \"**Continuous incremental improvement.**\"\n\nWhile we acknowledge that we might not be the driving force behind tech breakthroughs like a potential Aave V4 or, recently, the Governance V3 AIP, our daily commitment is unwavering. We aim to make the protocol 1% better every single day, one AIP at a time. It's through these consistent, small steps that we believe Aave can maintain its leadership in the DeFi space.\n\nOur efforts have already borne fruit. The implementation of offboarding plans for assets like BUSD & TUSD stands out. These initiatives not only enhanced protocol safety but also turned a profit, generating close to 1M$ for the DAO. This revenue, in itself, has multiple times repaid the investment made in the ACI. Furthermore, our vigilant oversight of the DAO's finances has ensured efficiency. We've curbed overspending, optimized budgets, and deterred proposals that didn't align with Aave's best interests, saving the DAO a 7-figure amount & ensuring every GHO & DAO $ is well spent.\n\n**What to expect for phase II?**\n\nThe ACI will continue to focus on our continuous incremental improvement doctrine, being a driving force in Aave protocol growth and BD.\n\nFor Phase II the main focal points will be on Liquid Staking Tokens diversity with the support of onboarding new assets, GHO growth and adoption with support of synergies and the integration of GHO in both onchain protocols, ramps & L2s.\n\n### Representation:\n\nThe ACI has actively engaged in both internal and external representation for the Aave DAO.\n\n**Internal Representation**:\n\nPrior to the ACI's involvement, the DAO too often encountered challenges, such as proposals not reaching the required quorum. Governance activity was subdued, and the operations were notably insular. The ACI introduced several key initiatives:\n\n- **Orbit Program**: The ACI allocated ~20% of its budget to the Orbit program, focusing on diversity. This program compensates recognized delegates for their contributions, leading to increased participation rates and improved diversity metrics. The frequency of proposals failing due to a lack of quorum has decreased. With the now DAO-funded Orbit program, **the DAO has enshrined these benefits**\n- **Governance Guidelines**: The ACI contributed to the establishment of the Aave DAO governance guidelines. This effort aimed to bring clarity, predictability, and efficiency to DAO governance. The \"**Minimal Viable Bureaucracy**\" ACI Doctrine, ensures a balance between structured governance and accessibility.\n- **Support for New Delegates**: The ACI has extended support to emerging delegate platforms, co-authoring proposals and providing guidance. This collaborative approach has enriched the DAO's ecosystem.\n\n**What to Expect from Phase II?**\n\nWe will continue contributing to the Aave DAO frameworks and supporting DAO active participants seeking a balance between organization & accessibility.\n\nWe will also delegate engineering resources for service providers via mini-dapps such as the recent [acistreamcollector.com](http://acistreamcollector.com), which allows no code claims of DAO streams.\n\n**External Representation**:\n\n![image|1920x1423](upload://o68ggEFjWsJdbQHaC8hqxPvL6sV.jpeg)\n\n\nExternally, the ACI has been a voice for the Aave DAO in various capacities.\n\n- **Event Participation**: The ACI has participated in and sponsored several global events to share insights and collaborate with industry peers. In 2023, our engagements included:\n    - Web3DNA (Paris)\n    - EthDubai 2023\n    - Prague DeFi Summit/EthPrague\n    - Stable Summit (Paris)\n    - EthCC[6] (Paris)\n    - Dappcon Berlin 2023\n    - LëtzStake (Luxembourg)\n    - EthLisbon\n    - Devconnect Istanbul\n    \n    A detailed list of our engagements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/f676c1ce96f44c648ef2a40f7f1bb442?pvs=21).\n    \n- **Regulatory Engagement**: The ACI's founder holds the position of president of the DeFi committee of the French Lobby ADAN. This role involves dialogues with regulators, institutions, and governments in France and Europe regarding the DeFi sector. The ACI has been involved in discussions related to the \"Mica 2\" regulation, which addresses DeFi services.\n\nThe ACI, as one of the voices for the Aave DAO, has consistently worked towards enhancing the DAO's presence and reputation in the broader ecosystem.\n\n**What to Expect from Phase II?**\n\nThe ACI will continue to be one of the voices of Aave across the globe, supporting devs in hackathons, being one of the DAO voices during events and supporting our brand quality.\n\n![image|1920x2075](upload://bgA23q6QZxmvVDtb93Q9FuEzm51.jpeg)\n\n\n## Proposal Details\n\n- **Duration**: 180 days\n- **Budget**: 375k GHO\n- **Scope**: Continuation of the ACI's work across Skyward, Growth, and Representation.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is presenting this ARFC independently and is not compensated by any third party for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Continuous Security Proposal Aave <> Certora\nAuthor: @Shelly - Certora\nCreated: 2023-12-01\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nWe offer to extend the existing [formal verification and manual review services](https://governance.aave.com/t/security-and-agility-of-aave-smart-contracts-via-continuous-formal-verification/10181)  and provide additional security services:\n\n1. Governance proposal reviews - Review every governance proposal in the on-chain stage as suggested by BGDLabs.\n2. We will assist Aave and BGD in reviewing Immunify bug bounties per request.\n\nThis proposal asks for a 1-year duration with a budget of $1.5m, starting from the 14th of September 2023.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDuring the 18 months of services, we have reviewed 169 smart contacts consisting of over 51,289 Solidity lines. We have prevented 28 significant bugs. Full breakdown of our work can be found in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DOU1TniPHNmbrgz-Sy7zduoP9BJrsZkP_cTGRDuiwwg/edit#gid=967449577).\n\n## Continuous Formal Verification (Auditing and Formal Verification integrated into CI)\n\nFollowing the success of the collaboration in [the last 18 months](https://governance.aave.com/t/security-and-agility-of-aave-smart-contracts-via-continuous-formal-verification/10181/19), we offer to continue this service in the same format - new code is formally verified and manually reviewed. Our [open-source CVL specification rules](https://github.com/Certora/aave-verification-projects-TOC) are checked using the Certora Prover and become publicly available when the code is released. The formal tests are also integrated into Aave’s CI system to continuously check changes introduced into the code. Reports are delivered upon demand at the end of each project. We have recently released a [free version of the Certora Prover](https://www.certora.com/signup?plan=prover) and the community can use this to validate the outputs.\n\nThe Aave and BGD teams will play a key role in rule writing going forward. These teams are highly technical and have insights into high-level properties of the protocol. Our team will review these rules and ensure the Certora Prover can formally prove these rules or find a bug. Our team will add more rules and manually review the code.\n\n## Governance Proposal Review\nFollowing BGD’s suggestion to add a third party to the governance proposals verification process, we will allocate a dedicated team to review each proposal on the on-chain stage within 3.5 days.\n\nEach proposal’s payload will be reviewed by the dedicated team, and we will verify that it does what it’s supposed to do according to its description/AIP. We will also check that there are no unwanted effects on the codebase, which is supposed to stay unchanged.\n\nOur job will be done after a review by BGD at an earlier stage. BGD will also assist with onboarding to guarantee the highest quality of service.\n\n## Incident Investigation Support Services\nTriaging and validating all the incoming bug reports for a massive protocol, such as Aave, can be highly time-consuming and distracting for the developing entities. Many of the reported issues turn out to be benign. However, at the time of the report, the severity and feasibility of bugs are still unknown. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate them with full seriousness and urgency. We offer to establish an incident investigation support team available 24/7 to support emergency cases. In every incident, we will write a rule that confirms or rejects the existence of a bug and later use it to test the validity of the fix. After every incident, we will update the specifications and incorporate the new tests in the CI.\n\nIn past commitments, we have played a crucial role in two critical incident responses. In one case, we concluded that there was no bug in the system. In another case, we identified a missing rule, wrote it, and used it to catch a tricky bug in the suggested fix before the code was deployed.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe annual price for the project is $1.5M: $1M is paid in GHO vested linearly over one year, and $500,000 is paid in Aave tokens vested linearly over one year. A 30-day termination is possible after a vote. We reduced the price of $2.7M from last year to reflect the bear market and inlined with the reduced project review capacity.\n\nThe Aave and the BGD team will also assist by writing their CVL rules.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nCertora is presenting this ARFC independently and is not compensated by any third party for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] TUSD Offboarding Plan Part II\nAuthor: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative  \nDate: 2023-09-17\n--\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC proposes the continuation of the [TUSD offboarding plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-tusd-offboarding-plan/14008) from Aave V2 by adjusting its risk parameters, mirroring the approach taken in the \"[ARFC] BUSD Offboarding Plan Part III\".\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of stablecoins offboarding of the Aave V2 market.\nTUSD is proposed to adopt the \"final stage\" offboarding parameters to incentivize repayment and withdrawal of liquidity in Aave V2 Pool\n\naBUSD will be withdrawn and converted to BUSD.\n\nThis ARFC also aims to authorize the ACI to publish regularly \"withdraw aToken\" mechanical AIPs that have low governance value. Part of the success of these offboarding plans relies on maintaining the available liquidity low, adding pressure on borrowers, and incentivizing repayment or, if there's a lack of reaction, accelerating HF decay to create liquidations.\n\nWe believe that once the governance approves the offboarding plans and once an asset reaches the \"final\" stage of interestStrategy curve, there's little to no governance value in going through the snapshot phase each time. A direct-to-AIP approach seems sufficient. \n\n## Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters Adjustment\n\nThe risk parameters for TUSD on Aave V2 will be adjusted as follows:\n\n| Parameter              | Previous Value | New Value |\n|------------------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)    | 0%             | 0%       |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 75%       | 65%      |\n| Liquidation Bonus      | 10%            | 10%      |\n| Reserve Factor         | 95%            | 99.9%    |\n| uOptimal               | 20%              | 1%       |\n| Base Rate              | 0%              | 100%     |\n| Slope 1                | 10%              | 70%      |\n| Slope 2                | 200%              | 300%     |\n\n## Disclamer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If community consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage\n3. if snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] Further increase GHO Borrow Rate\nauthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative\ncreated: 2023-10-05\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes a further increase in the GHO borrow rate by 50 basis points (bps), raising it from 2.5% to 3%.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave community has previously recognized the importance of adjusting the GHO borrow rate to maintain the stability and health of the protocol. The motivations for this proposal are:\n\n1. **Strengthening the GHO Peg**: The prior adjustment to the GHO borrow rate resulted in a stronger GHO peg. An additional increase is anticipated to further bolster the peg and get closer to the target value.\n2. **Enhancing GHO Revenue**: By increasing the borrow rate, the protocol is expected to generate additional revenue from GHO borrowings.\n3. **Coordinated Effort**: This proposal aligns with other initiatives, including the GHO buy program set of AIPs, as part of a coordinated effort to support the GHO peg.\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\n\nThis proposal also greenlights the ACI for a `direct-to-AIP` process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate. \n\n## Specification\n\n- Asset: GHO  \n- Contract Address: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f  \n- Current Borrow Rate: 2.5%  \n- Proposed Borrow Rate: 3%  \n- New discounted Borrow Rate: ~2.1%\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
