        "body": "**Title**: [ARFC] sDAI Aave V3 Onboarding\n\n**Author**: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs\n\n**Date**: 2023-08-09\n\n**Summary**:\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard sDAI as a collateral-only asset into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. It outlines the specific parameters for integration and aims to create new synergies with the MakerDAO ecosystem.\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nThe recent increase in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) to 8%—though anticipated to decrease to 5%—presents a unique opportunity for Aave to forge new synergies with the MakerDAO ecosystem. By integrating liquid DSR deposit tokens (sDAI) as a collateral-only asset in the Aave V3 Ethereum pool, Aave can offer users the dual benefit of earning DSR yield while utilizing their assets as collateral. In the context of GHO, this integration would create a yield-generating stablecoin with a higher yield than the GHO borrow cost. It's important to note that this proposal does not conflict with the [DSR integration in aDAI reserve proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-integrating-makerdaos-dsr-into-aave-v3-ethereum-pool/13360), but rather complements it. However, current engineering constraints make immediate integration difficult in the short-term. Should governance approve this proposal, both sDAI and DAI would serve as reserves in the Aave V3 Ethereum pool, with sDAI primarily used as collateral and DAI as a borrowable asset.\n\n**Specification**:\n\nWe propose the following modifications to the Aave V3 & V2 Ethereum pools:\n\nsDAI contract: 0x83F20F44975D03b1b09e64809B757c47f942BEeA\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| wETH Optimal Ratio on V3 | from 80% to 90% |\n| wETH slope 1 on V3 | from 4.8% to 3.8% |\n| DAI RF on V2 | from 15% to 25% |\n| DAI RF on V3 | from 10% to 20% |\n| DAI optimal ratio on V3 | from 80% to 90% |\n| DAI Slope1 on V3 | from 4% to 5% |\n| DAI optimal ratio on V2 | from 80% to 90% |\n| DAI Slope1 on V2 | from 4% to 5% |\n| DAI stable Borrow | disabled on V2 |\n| sDAI parameters | same as DAI but as collateral only |\n| LTV | 77% |\n| LT | 80% |\n| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |\n\n**Disclaimer**:\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative & Chaos Labs are not affiliated with or paid by MakerDAO to publish this ARFC. At the time of writing, The ACI has large parts of its own treasury in the DSR, intending to use sDAI as collateral to mint GHO.\n\n**Next Steps**:\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding\n\n## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs\n\n## Date: 2023-08-09\n---\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.\n\nThis integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.\n\nAlongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.\n\nIt's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.\n\nwGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:\n\n- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset, isolation mode, and emode focus asset.\n- wGHO parameters:\n\n| LTV | 77% |\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 80%  |\n| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |\n| Supply Cap | 10M |\n| Borrow Cap | 0 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 10M$ |\n- Create a dedicated stablecoin emode on Aave V3 ETH pool for wGHO, USDC, USDT, DAI, LUSD\n- Emode stablecoin category parameters:\n\n| LTV | 87.5% |\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 90% |\n| Liquidation penalty | 1% |\n\n### Note:\n\nwGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.\n\nOnboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

The proposed risk parameters for LUSD will mirror those currently in place for USDC on the same pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by users of the Liquity Protocol. It has demonstrated its resilience and maintained a stable peg, even in volatile market conditions. By adding LUSD as a collateral asset on the Aave V3 ETH pool, we can offer our users more options for their DeFi activities. Furthermore, the integration of LUSD could potentially synergize with the GHO, enhancing liquidity and further reinforcing the stability of the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed risk parameters for LUSD on the Aave V3 ETH pool are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 77% |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 80% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 4.5% |\n\nThese parameters are identical to those currently in place for USDC on the Aave V3 ETH pool.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173/13) program, the ACI has not been compensated by any third-party to present this ARFC.\nAt the time of writing, the author does not hold LQTY tokens but owns some LUSD.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP for final approval and implementation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This would be achieved by integrating sDAI, an ERC-4626 Vault token that includes the DSR yield, into the Aave protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DSR is a variable rate set by MakerDAO governance that allows DAI holders to earn savings by locking their DAI into the DSR contract. Recently, MakerDAO governance plans to increase the DSR rate to 3.49%. By integrating the DSR into Aave via sDAI, we can allow Aave liquidity providers to benefit from the DSR rate without additional cost to the Aave DAI borrowers.\n\n## Specification\n\nAt the protocol level, when a user deposits DAI, the protocol will wrap their DAI in the form of sDAI and deliver aDAI to the user. When a user borrows DAI, the protocol will unwrap the stored sDAI, deliver DAI, and accrue the debt amount in DAI.\n\n![image|1920x1563, 40%](upload://fQNJl46MrGPtwEuH6Trg6zzyqNP.jpeg)\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis integration will have the consequence of increasing the gas cost of using DAI in Aave for every user. The exact impact of these gas cost increases should be reviewed and considered by the community during the ARFC stage of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK receives positive feedback and a Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, the next step would be to draft an ARFC\ndetailing the technical implementation of this integration.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not paid by makerDAO or any third party to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The BUSD will be kept as such in the collector contract, and a separate AIP will organize the swap of BUSD into other assets at a later stage.\n\n## **Next steps**\n\n- Gather community consensus & feedback on this ARFC\n- Snapshot polling vote on the ARFC\n- If the community approves ARFC via Snapshot vote, Publication of an AIP implementation.\n\n## **Disclamer**\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by Binance to publish this ARFC.\n\nAt the time of writing, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, Does not hold any BUSD.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",

Forum views are mixed, emphasizing concerns about early borrower impacts and alternative approaches, yet no strong opposition outpaces support. Historical examples of similar GHO-related proposals passed successfully and led to positive market responses. The market showed slight declines during the event, but these are minor and contextual. Overall, the recommendation favors the proposed change to increase the borrow rate as a balanced approach to re-establishing the GHO peg and promoting sustainable growth. The stance reflects a nuanced view prioritizing long-term health of the protocol while acknowledging community caution.",
