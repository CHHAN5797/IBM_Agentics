        "body": "Author: Angle Core Team\nForum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-ageur-on-aave-v3-on-polygon/7325\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list agEUR, Angle Protocol's decentralized Euro, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon.\n\nAngle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient.  \nThe protocol has started by launching agEUR, a Euro stablecoin in November. This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 129m, a TVL in the protocol > $225m, and an average daily volume > $4m.\n\nagEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains, like on Polygon with the PoS bridge.\n\nSo far, there are more than 8m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity on Quickswap ($14m liquidity) and on Curve (~$2.5m).  \nBesides Quickswap and Curve on Polygon, on mainnet agEUR has liquidity pools on UniswapV3 ($48m liquidity for agEUR/USDC), Sushiswap ($11m for agEUR/ANGLE) and Curve ($130m). The stablecoin can be minted in a capital-efficient way at oracle value from the protocol meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.\n\nStablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora and Fuse.\n\nThe stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 155%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).\n\n## Links & References\n\n-   [Docs](https://docs.angle.money/)\n-   Token Contracts: All Angle related contract addresses can be found [here](https://developers.angle.money/protocol-overview/smart-contracts)\n-   [Smart contracts/Code](https://github.com/AngleProtocol)\n-   [Analytics](https://analytics.angle.money/)\n\nagEUR has no Chainlink feed yet but it passes all the security requirements to get eligible to a feed. If this Snapshot vote is positive, then the Chainlink team could setup this oracle pretty rapidly.\n\n## Security Considerations and Risk Analysis\n\nAngle has had three different audits by Chainsecurity and Sigma Prime which can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits). It also has a $500k bug bounty on Immunefi.\n\nAngle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol, it is ruled by the ANGLE token and more generally by the veANGLE token (which went live in January)\n\nVotes by veANGLE holders are implemented by a 4/6 multisig composed of 3 core team members (Guillaume Nervo, Picodes, Pablo Veyrat), Julien Bouteloup, 0xMaki and SebVentures.\n\nagEUR token contract on mainnet is upgradeable and can be upgraded by the multisig described above. Only protocol related contracts have minting rights on this contract, and so there's no multisig or EOA that can directly mint agEUR at the moment.\nagEUR on Polygon can also be upgraded by a multisig on Polygon. Only Polygon PoS has the minting right on the contract.\n\nagEUR has been assessed by Curve Team, report is available [here](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/ageur-angle-protocol?utm_source=url)\n\n## Benefits for Aave V3\n\nagEUR could be an interesting asset for Aave V3 efficiency modes: for instance if there is an efficiency mode with other Euro stablecoins, we could imagine people taking advantage of Aave V3 to get significant leverage and to arb the stablecoin back to peg (leveraging Curve and potentially Quickswap as well).\n\nAngle community could even push for shifting incentives from Quickswap to UniV3 on Polygon to allow for better arbs leveraging Aave.\n\nagEUR could also be another asset in Aave’s Polygon efficiency mode for stablecoins in general allowing for interesting FX arbs here as well.\n\nOn top of that, in the first place agEUR could be used in isolation mode which means this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.\n\nAs for the overall benefit of agEUR for the Aave community, many agEUR holders are looking for a reliable place to deposit their stablecoins and get a simple yield on this. Aave would provide this use case.  \nMore generally, many DeFi farmers are coming from Europe and want to get a yield on their home currency without being exposed to a USD/EUR change risk. Listing agEUR on Aave would open the gates for many institutional players coming to get yield on their €.\n\nBesides arbitrageurs, we could expect borrowers of agEUR to be people wanting to either take advantage of the different yield opportunities provided by LPing agEUR or by people wanting to get leveraged on another asset while being exposed to the € price of it (and not the $).\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, the following parameters are proposed:\n\n1.  V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2.  V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3.  V3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 5M$ debt ceiling\n\n## Protocol Data\n\n### Market Data\n\n- Market Cap: $145m, ($8.7m on Polygon)\n- 24h volume: typically ranges between $2-$20m\n\n### Social Channels\n\n- Twitter: 25.9k\n- Discord: 31.2k\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens:\n\nOn mainnet:\n\n-   **Date of Deployment**: Oct 23rd 2021\n-   **Number of Transactions**: 2347 and 15614 transfers\n-   **Number of holders for token**: 489 (NB: there are many incentive programs involving LPs of agEUR which means actual amount of holders is higher)\n\nOn Polygon:\n\n-   **Date of Deployment**: Nov 23rd 2021\n-   **Number of Transactions**: 683and 5976 transfers\n-   **Number of holders for token**: 162\n\n## Voting Options\n\nYES - deploy AAVE V3 on Polygon with agEUR listed\nNO - do not list agEUR on AAVE V3\n\n",

        "body": "Author: QiDao Protocol core team\nForum post: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-mai-on-aave-v3/7630\n\nProposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)\n\n### Summary\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.\n\nAll accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.\n\nThere’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\n* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCore team at QiDao Protocol.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.\n\nMAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.\n\nDespite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.\n\nMAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.\n\n3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\nBeing the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.\n\nMAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.\n\nMAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\n* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.\n* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance\n* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\n* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)\n* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap\n* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon\n* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM\n* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties\n* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nUsers can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users\nThere is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences\nThe multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.\nSince the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n* Market Cap: ~$250M\n* 24h Volume: >$40M\n* Volatility: Low\n* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose\n* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21\n\n9.

        "body": "**Author**: Jarvis Network Core Team\n**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)\n\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.\n\n# About Jarvis Network\nSynthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.\n\njFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.\n\nThe protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.\n\nWe have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).\n\nCombined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).\n\nWe also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.\n\njEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.\n\nWe debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.\n\nThe protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:\n\n- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).\n- $78M of volume on our primary market.\n- 33k swaps by 9k users.\n- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).\n- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).\n- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.\n- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.\n\n# Benefits for Aave V3\n### Fiat on and off-ramp\njEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.\n\nWe have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).\n\nHaving jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.\n\n### Large addressable market\nA part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).\n\n### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins\njEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.\n\n### DDM\njEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.\n\n### Low risk collateral\nAs collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.\n\njEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.\n\njEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.\n\n\n# Risk Parameters\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:\n\n1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.\n\n# Security specification and risks\n\n### Risks inherent to jEUR\nBesides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.\n\njEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.\n\n\n[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)\n\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.\njEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.\n\nThere is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.\n\nIt does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.\n\n### Audits\nWe have had two different audits by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and [Ubik](https://ubikgroup.co/): [Read the audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/security)\n\n# Data\n\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap: €3.5M circulating ($4M)\n- 24h Volume: $2M on our primary market, $400k on secondary markets\n- Volatility: Low\n- Maturity: Early\n\n### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n- Discord: 3k members\n- Twitter: 16.1k followers\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: Sep 2021 (Polygon)\n- Number of Transactions: 116k transactions including 30k swaps on our primary market and 22k on secondary markets.\n- Number of holders for token: 3,242 (more holders possible due to farming programs)\n\n# Links\n- Website: [https://jarvis.network](https://jarvis.network)\n- Dune: [Jarvis Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/0xroll/JarvisNetwork)\n- Docs: [https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network)\n- Code: [https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network)\n\n# Voting options\n- YES, add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n- NO, do not add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n",

CVX is the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCVX is not currently listed on major lending markets, including CVX on the platform would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage. This has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earn asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around $578.04k at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance. Further details can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n##  Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nLlama Community has presented a proposal to deposit Aave community funds into Curve and Convex Finance. Listing CVX on Aave enables Aave to earn aCVX tokens which can then be used to support the treasury management proposal detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?**\n\nConvex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted $CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV.. Adding support for $CVX will in turn provide future opportunities as Convex will also support other protocols in time. ie: FXS\n\nCVX is the governance token of the Convex protocol. By locking $CRV for life on Convex, each user gives his veCRV voting power to vlCVX holders (CVX lockers). Every vlCVX holders can vote on Convex governance proposals but also Curve governance proposals and gauges weights (5.05 veCRV/vlCVX). In the future, each vlCVX holders will control voting power on other tokens like FXS (users already can lock for life FXS for cvxFXS but vlCVX holders cannot vote on Frax governance proposals and gauges weights).\n\n**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nCVX would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem. Adding CVX creates another use case outside of the Convex tokenomics model. Llama expects the CVX demand to be similar to CRV. Additionally:\n\n* Significant Borrow Demand: Users can borrow CVX and then either stake or lock the CVX token to earn yield. In addition to direct yield, investors may borrow CVX to lock and then influence how the inflation schedule of CRV and CVX is distributed. CRV has one of the highest utilisations and dollar value borrowed of all high volatility assets listed on Aave V2.\n* CVX holders can deposit (lend) CVX and then borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).\n\nLlama Community intends to use the aCVX revenue generated to support Treasury Management activities. In this instance, aCVX could be redeemed and locked on Convex to then influence how the CRV and CVX inflation schedule is distributed. Llama Community intends to use the CVX to support growing the Aave and sAave Curve liquidity pools.\n\nThere is $43.2M TVL on the sAAVE pool and $11.8M TVL on the AAVE pool on Convex.\n\nThe Convex community is looking forward to lending and borrowing CVX on Aave. The community will enjoy extra revenues from the reserve factor.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nConvex, as DeFi farmers themselves, the team needed a platform that allowed users to receive the max boost possible from CRV in a simplified manner and allow users to collect their actual rewards directly without auto-selling. They also believe CRV stakers should be rewarded more as they are effectively, mining together with Liquidity Providers. They intend to change that with Convex by charging a lower performance fee, returning fees back to the CRV stakers and CVX token holders, and distributing rewards directly.\n\nThe concept of Convex was published to the public on April 15, 2021 with the protocol launching on May 17, 2021.\n\n30th April 2021 - [Convex platform was whitelisted on the Curve platform](https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-57-whitelist-the-convex-protocol/1654%20and%20Vote%20results:%20https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/44)\n17th May 2022 - [Convex was released](https://convexfinance.medium.com/ready-set-go-69bd68019c5a)\n7th September 2021 - [CVX vote locking went live](https://convexfinance.medium.com/september-update-vote-locking-launch-liquidity-provider-incentives-and-more-1380f406f725)\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**\n\nThe CVX token governs over 559M$ worth of CRV locked in the protocol (and $4M worth of CVX in the Convex treasury multisig). CVX is currently only available on 2 Fuse pools, however there is no liquidity there.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThe emission schedule can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/tokenomics).\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nConvex multisig can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/multisig-admin-rights).\n\n**8.

        "body": "---\naip: <to be assigned>\ntitle: Add FEI to Aave V2\nstatus: Proposed\nauthor: Joey Santoro (@joeysantoro), Brianna Montgomery (@bpm6867)\nshortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the FEI stablecoin\ndiscussions: https://discord.gg/aDeErjS6Dt\ncreated: 2021-06-16\nupdated: N/A\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in lending markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: lending, synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n27K followers on Twitter, 2 17k members in Discord 3, Github\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\tDate of Deployment: March 28, 2021\n\tNumber of Transactions: 81,798\n\tNumber of Holders: 4,089\n\n## Rationale\nBecause FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing and lending. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0x08bbB5922550e6992ebDA8252A31AA02924EF28A\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0xa4893779e193AbD23CE494e5400ca340033606C7\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0xa4767eA500bc04430dE609A523CDc99c9537867C\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0x9f7663e34a2c2Be586126Eed5AF4651b062a51A6\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
