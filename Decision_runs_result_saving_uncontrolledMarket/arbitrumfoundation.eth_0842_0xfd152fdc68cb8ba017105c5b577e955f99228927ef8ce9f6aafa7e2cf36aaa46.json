    "ai_final_conclusion": "Option 'Approve funding' selected with stance to keep 'Change'.",
    "ai_final_reason": "- Timeline voting metrics show overwhelming and stable support for approval from the start to the end of the voting period, indicating strong consensus.\n- Forum sentiment is mixed but overall leans positive with key supporters emphasizing the protocol's strong growth, responsible funding request, and innovative incentive approaches. Negative comments mainly focus on concerns about incentive distribution and scale.\n- Historical lessons from similar proposals indicate successful funding outcomes that drove adoption despite some TVL declines, underscoring the value of continuing targeted incentive programs.\n- Market impact around the event window was mildly negative on price but slightly positive on TVL; this does not contradict the recommendation to fund given the growth metrics and positive community endorsements.\n- The recommendation aligns with aggregated forum sentiment favoring approval, reflecting community views and maximizing long-term protocol health.",
