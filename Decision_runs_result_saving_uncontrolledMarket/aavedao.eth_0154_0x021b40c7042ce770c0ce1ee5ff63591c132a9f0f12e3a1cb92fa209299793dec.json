        "body": "Authors: Agora\nDate: October 22, 2024\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard AUSD, a secure digital dollar backed 1:1 by USD fiat, to Aave V3 on Avalanche. AUSD, issued by Agora, serves as a stable and liquid alternative to USDT and USDC. With a growing AUM and robust liquidity, AUSD will enhance Aave’s liquidity pool, offering users a reliable and efficient stablecoin option with strong institutional backing.\n\nMotivation\n\nAgora offers AUSD, a digital dollar minted 1:1 with USD fiat. AUSD is designed to be a secure digital currency, utilizing one of the world’s largest custodian banks to safeguard assets. AUSD enables users to participate in trading, lending and payments. It is the most cost-efficient stablecoin to transact with due to its gas-optimized smart contract, making it ideal for traders and payments.\n\nAgora operates an open partnership model, allowing collaboration with a diverse range of customers who meet KYB (Know Your Business) requirements and operate in jurisdictions we can serve. This approach contrasts with single partnership models (eg. Exchange-Backed Stables), ensuring that AUSD can be widely adopted across different ecosystems, providing liquidity and stability without conflicts of interest.\n\nAUSD is currently available on Ethereum, Avalanche, Sui and Mantle, garnering $70+ million in TVL and $12+ million in daily DEX volume since contract deployment. The reserve assets are managed by VanEck ($100B+ asset manager) and custodied with one of the largest global banks, ensuring security and safety. AUSD’s unique value proposition also includes zero-fee minting and redemption facilities, making it an attractive asset for all ecosystem participants.\n\nBy integrating AUSD into Aave, users will gain access to a stable, liquid asset that supports trading, lending, and other decentralized finance activities. This integration aligns with Aave’s mission to decentralize finance while offering secure and reliable stablecoin options.\n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments\n\nWe can ensure that $1M+ will be deposited in initial Aave liquidity pools within 1 week of launch. We are working with Tier 1 market makers as well as large institutional firms. Agora already has 50+ institutions (trading firms, exchanges, payment companies, etc.) onboarded.\n\nWith Avalanche, in particular, strong additional liquidity programs will be put in place.\n\nSpecifications\n\nAUSD Token Contract Address:\nAvalanche: 0x00000000eFE302BEAA2b3e6e1b18d08D69a9012a 8\nChain: Avalanche to start\nAudits: AUSD contracts have been audited by Spearbit and Certora, with zero critical, high, or medium issues identified. We also have conducted a risk audit with Chaos Labs and received an A grade.\nRisk Analysis\n\nSmart Contract Risk: AUSD contracts follow best practices and have undergone extensive audits by Spearbit and Certora, ensuring a secure and reliable smart contract architecture.\nMarket Risk: AUSD is backed by a portfolio of short-dated USD fiat money market instruments, with the majority of the allocation in overnight repo, which is T+1 for maximum liquidity. This backing minimizes volatility and ensures that AUSD remains a stable and reliable asset within Aave’s ecosystem.\nChaos Labs: A risk audit has been conducted by Chaos Labs and we have received an A grade.\nOracles: Various oracle providers support AUSD including Chainlink, Chaos, Pyth, API3, Redstone, and others.\nLinks\n\nGas Optimization 1, Bloomberg 1 (Raise Announcement)\n\nAUSD hits $100M in weekly volume on Avalanche 3.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under CCO.",

        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-09-02\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nStakeStone is the protocol issuing STONE, the liquid ETH, with over 150k users. Currently, StakeStone is seeking support to onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll and is launching a series of initiatives to boost liquidity and Aave adoption.\n\n### **Motivation/Background**\n\nSTONE is an ERC-20 rebalancing token that generates risk-free rewards for ETH based on blue-chip underlying assets like Lido, EigenLayer, and Symbiotic in a decentralized manner through our OPAP governance mechanism. StakeStone currently has $350 million worth of STONE deployed on Scroll. To ensure that STONE has robust liquidity, in addition to the STONE-ETH DEX liquidity on Scroll, STONE also has PMM powered cross-chain liquidity. Users can perform cross-chain redemption and receive ETH on the Ethereum mainnet within 40 seconds, with optimized pricing.\n\nSTONE aims to become the liquid ETH, covering users’ opportunity costs while creating more use cases for STONE holders. Thanks to its architecture supporting multiple underlying assets, STONE can maintain market adaptability and stability over the long term, allowing users and the protocol to avoid the need to mint or integrate a new asset.\n\n**Benefits of listing STONE token:**\n\nSTONE is collaborating with Scroll to build a DeFi ecosystem. STONE works closely with various protocols to support the ecosystem and facilitate their go-to-market strategies. Currently, STONE is the largest asset category on Scroll, accounting for over 30% of the total TVL across the chain, with a high utilization rate (close to 90%). The StakeStone team is dedicated to offering services to protocols that support STONE while fostering collaboration for shared prosperity, which is reflected in the high utilization of STONE across various DeFi use cases.\n\n**Market Impact:**\n\nAs of today, over 180,000 ETH have been staked in StakeStone, with a historical high of 340,000 ETH. StakeStone has also successfully processed nearly 1 billion dollars in inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, STONE has a wide user base, and all users are very active on-chain. We hope that this active community can bring more liquidity and activity to AAVE.\n\n### **Chain to be deployed/listed:**\n\nScroll chain. Scroll grew to become the top zk rollup in terms of TVL and shows continued strength in community and volume.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nStakeStone has collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity for a more robust and diverse liquidity environment at AAVE. Large liquidity providers are highly interested in using STONE in AAVE and further boosting DEX liquidity for STONE. StakeStone will also have its own liquidity mining incentive campaign for STONE in AAVE.\n\nTo incentivize the use of STONE in AAVE, StakeStone will provide boosted STONE points for STONE suppliers and is planning a yield-boost campaign specifically designed to maximize engagement.\n\nAmong our active liquidity providers, we have gathered strong interest in using STONE for lending and borrowing. The team will actively engage with liquidity providers to achieve a supply of at least 5,000 STONE, gradually increasing it over time as risk parameters are adjusted.\n\n### Specification\n\nFollowing analysis from Chaos Labs, the recommend the following parameter settings are:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 4,800 |\n| Borrow Cap | 480 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72.5% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### Other relevant information\n\nSTONE has undergone multiple rounds of audits conducted by firms such as Quantstamp, Slowmist, Veridise, and Secure3, and closely collaborates with security organizations like Cobo and Coincover.\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n[Dune Analytics for data about STONE](https://dune.com/HolyMoon/stakestone)\n\n[Security audits](https://docs.stakestone.io/stakestone/additionals/audits-and-security)\n\n[Governance votes about asset](https://app.stakestone.io/u/portfolio-allocation/vote/vote-list)\n\n[OPAP proposal example](https://x.com/Stake_Stone/status/1772286551340286261)\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeStone and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-26\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\nThis proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nArtemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 30.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Website](https://artemisfinance.io)\n\n[X](https://x.com/Artemisfinance)\n\nDocuments:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/)\n\nAudit Report:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit)\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 800 Mn+ (~270k Eth) TVL\n- 20K+ restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH, sfrxETH, and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\n*> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-08-09 and ARFC has been updated.* It is recommended listing rsETH using an exchange rate oracle. \n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 19,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,900 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-Correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9.83% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn\n    - Few others\n- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)\n\n**Oracles**:\n\nrsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:\n\nChainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6\n\nChainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nRedstone market feed:\n\n[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nrsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.\n\nAccepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.\n\nExchange rate calculation -\n\nA → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain\n\nB → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]\n\nC → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]\n\nD → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]\n\nE → Total supply of rsETH\n\nExchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nPrior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. \n\nNevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n* [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n* Contract Address:[ 0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n* [GitHub Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

The token allows users to participate in the staking rewards while maintaining the flexibility to use their staked assets within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nOnboarding slisBNB will allow Aave users to utilize it as collateral, thus broadening the asset base and enhancing overall liquidity.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments\n\nUsers who supply slisBNB liquidity on Aave, will be eligible to get stardust (points) from Lista's ongoing point system Cosmic Adventure Challenge Season 3, which will turn to LISTA token airdrop when Season 3 ends.\n\n### Specification\n\nToken Name: slisBNB\n\nUnderlying Asset: Staked BNB\n\nContract: 0xB0b84D294e0C75A6abe60171b70edEb2EFd14A1B\n\n> Risk Parameters and analysis have been provided by Risk Service Providers so ARFC has been be updated accordingly.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|E-Mode Category|None|\n|Supply Cap|20,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|55%|\n|LT|60%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.50%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nhttps://lista.org/\n\nhttps://lista.org/liquid-staking/BNB\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Lista DAO and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
