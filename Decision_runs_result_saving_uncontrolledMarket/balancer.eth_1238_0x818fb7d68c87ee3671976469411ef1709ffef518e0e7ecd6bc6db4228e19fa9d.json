This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/521\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis proposal enables a Gyroscope gauge for a R/sDAI Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP) on Ethereum Mainnet. The pool will be seeded with liquidity in the 0.9 - 1.001 range and two other pools with liquidity in the 0.95 - 1.001 and 0.98 - 1.001 range will follow soon. By deploying these new pools, users will be able to trade between R and sDAI at extremely low price impact in the 0.9 - 1.001 R/sDAI range. The deployment of this pool builds upon the release of the Peg Stability Module (PSM), aimed at stabilizing the R peg and providing a source of yield for R Savings Module depositors through the accumulation of sDAI.\n\n**Protocol description**\n\nRaft is a DeFi protocol that lets you generate $R, a leading decentralized USD stablecoin, by opening a CDP (collateralized debt position), or by depositing stablecoins into the Raft protocol reserve.R is backed by high quality collateral assets such as[ stETH](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth) (Lido Staked Ether) and[ rETH](https://stake.rocketpool.net/) (Rocket Pool ETH) and reserve assets such as[ CHAI](https://chai.money/), the yield-bearing version of the DAI stablecoin. R aims to be the stablecoin of choice within the decentralized ecosystem, with deep liquidity across many trading pairs, a high yield, and a stable peg. As more use cases for $R develop, users will be able to spend, swap, and earn with $R. Users will also be able to leverage up to 6x on different LSD tokens in a single atomic transaction.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe R/sDAI pool on Gyroscope is a natural progression from the PSM, offering swaps from R to sDAI with the best price impact conditions compared to other uniform liquidity pools. The pool will receive incentives that will be distributed based on the PSM's ongoing usage and the development of the R peg over time. Liquidity providers in such pool will benefit from earning the DAI Savings Rate and from being depositors in the most capital efficient pool where to trade R.\n\nThe pool will have 5 bps swap fees, an amplification coefficient of 700 and a 10 bps upper price bound that enables the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n1. Governance: The Raft governance model focuses on being efficient, transparent, and community-driven, while maintaining a governance-minimized approach. The governance model will be strengthened further by the launch of a native token that confers governance power to its holders.\n\n2. Oracles: The pools rely on price feeds from Chainlink and Tellor\n\n3. Audits: Raft is audited by Trail of Bits and Hats Finance\n\n4. Market History: Raft was launched on June 5th 2023 and has attracted approx $65m TVL at its peak. The Raft team has worked with the Balancer community to launch two successful pools (see $R here, the R/DAI pool on Balancer[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x20a61b948e33879ce7f23e535cc7baa3bc66c5a9000000000000000000000555) and R/wstETH pool[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x380aabe019ed2a9c2d632b51eddd30fd804d0fad0002000000000000000005547c47f942beea)) . We would like to continue working within the Balancer ecosystem going forward.\n\n5. Value: The R/DAI pool deployed on Balancer has been among the top 5 pools on Balancer by trading volume in the last few weeks, exceeding $ 1 mln daily trading volume. We expect the R/sDAI pool on Gyroscope to generate a consistent amount of volume due to the capital efficiency embedded in the concentrated liquidity model and in the choice of pairing R with a yield-bearing asset like sDAI\n\n**Centralization vectors**\n\n1. Liquidations are permissionless (anybody can liquidate)\n2. The key parts of the Raft protocol are immutable\n3. The Liquidity Committee includes 3 Raft team members. More to be added in the future as the Raft governance evolves\n\n\n**References / useful links**\n\n· Website: [https://raft.fi/ ](https://raft.fi/)\n\n· Documentation: https://docs.raft.fi/\n\n· Twitter: https://twitter.com/raft_fi\n\n· Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/raft-fi)\n\n· GitHub: [Raft · GitHub](https://github.com/raft-fi/) \n\n**Audits**\n\nRaft’s smart contracts have been audited twice:\n\n1.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/949\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Base, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Base: 0x99aC4484e8a1dbd6A185380B3A811913Ac884D87\n\nsDAI / aUSDC Base pool on Gyro: https://app.gyro.finance/pools/base/e-clp/0x821afe819450a359e29a5209c48f2fa3321c8ad2/\n\nChild chain gauge: [https://basescan.org/address/0x6A3F93bB18fbdDea76169D3D94d03371E9e0DdC4#code]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1\n\ngaugeType(string): Base",

Our main goal is to create a win-win scenario where all participants benefit, ultimately making yields more attractive and accessible to a broader range of users. The concept of veTokens has a proven track record within the industry. Notable projects like Curve/Convex and Balancer/Aura have effectively implemented similar models. We are confident that this approach serves as a potent mechanism for aligning the interests of both liquidity providers and Pendle token holders.\n\nOur native token EQB acts as a governance and incentivisation tool within the ecosystem. Locked EQB tokens will have governance rights in the system and will be able to vote using the protocol owned vePENDLE voting power as well as on internal proposals.\n\nBoost Pendle LP Yield: Our core idea is to align liquidity providers and $PENDLE holders together to maximize incentives for all participants.\n\n* Liquidity providers, who provide liquidity to Pendle through Equilibria, can earn boosted rewards in both $PENDLE and $EQB, even if they do not own any $PENDLE. EQB is our governance token,EQB earned can further be locked to receive a share of the protocol's revenue and to vote and earn bribes.\n\n*  $PENDLE holders, on the other hand, can convert their tokens into $ePENDLE and stake them to earn rewards in both $PENDLE and $EQB. $ePENDLE holders can also easily exit their position by swapping back to $PENDLE, providing flexibility and ease of use.\n\nVoting & Bribe:\n\n* Vote: vlEQB (locked EQB) is available on both Arbitrum and Ethereum. We enable users to vote on multi chains. The votes will be merged to control the vePENDLE Equilibria owned in Pendle's Gauge Voting system. Participating in the Gauge Voting can earn a vote reward from Pendle and potential bribe reward.\n* Bribe: Protocols who have liquidity on Pendle Finance are very keen to buy votes from Equlibria. By doing this, they can get more PENDLE emission on their liquidity. So there will be very promising bribes rewards for all the vlEQB holders. After votes on Snapshot, the bribe reward will be distributed. The voters can claim their bribes at Equilibria website.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Explain why this pool needs incentivization\nThis proposal aims to introduce a veBAL gauge for the ePENDLE/PENDL pool, with the objective of establishing substantial ePENDLE liquidity on Balancer. The inclusion of platform BAL incentives is intended to further enhance ePENDLE liquidity and maintain a more stable peg for ePENDLE. Upon approval, we anticipate actively promoting our new veBAL gauge and leveraging EQB's bribe feature to facilitate incentivization, thereby contributing to the development of the Balancer bribe market narrative. \nThe Equilibria Team remains committed to being a prominent supporter of Balancer technology and a catalyst for BAL emissions through our bribe incentives. Once the ePENDLE/PENDLE pool is eligible for BAL rewards, our bribe feature and strategy will be instrumental in encouraging trading, incentivizing liquidity providers, and fostering LP farming activities on the Balancer platform.\n\n**Specifications:**\n Equilibria Finance has managed to lock approximately 7.8 million PENDLE tokens on our platform, which account for 24% of the total vePENDLE supply. It has been expanding across multiple chains -Ethereum,Arbitrum, BNB Chain and Optimism. This expansion now achieves $64M TVL, and offers diverse opportunities to our users.\n\nYou can view analytics for Equilibria on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official website](https://equilibria.fi/), [official docs](https://docs.equilibria.fi/) and our [DUNE](https://dune.com/lxx1233/equilibria-finance) pages.\n1. **Governance:**  Information on governance [Overview - ](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)[Equilibria votes and snapshots](https://docs.equilibria.fi/mechanism/vote-and-bribes):\n\nProtocols who have liquidity on Pendle Finance, their Pendle emission are determined by votes which investors could use vlEQB to vote at Equilibria snapshot either at Arbitrum or Ethereum, you can visit and vote at Equilibria Snapshot [Epoch #xx] Weekly Pendle Gauge Vote. The official snapshot page is: https://snapshot.org/#/equilibriafi.eth\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?No.\n\n3. **Audits:** \nAt Equilibria, security is our top priority. Our experienced team, with backgrounds at renowned companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, and Airbnb, has meticulously designed robust security measures. We have undergone rigorous auditing by Peckshield and WatchPug, with detailed reports available at [here](https://docs.equilibria.fi/security-and-risk/audits)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Equilibria employs a 3/5 multi-signature control mechanism and utilize timelock contracts to provide enhanced security and peace of mind for our users.\n\n5. **Market History:** Equilibria launched In June of 2023. Through the ePendle Pool and incentives, Equilibria maintains the flexibility to adjust incentives on ePendle pool and provide more strategy in ePendle pool to boosting the yield in order to optimize supply and demand for ePendle and to maintain its peg to PENDLE. Equilibria’s strategy and mechanics have proven to be resilient at defending the [peg](https://twitter.com/equilibriafi/status/1684563705693097984). See ePendle price [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/equilibria-finance-ependle), EQB price [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/equilibria-finance);\n\nPool link [here 4](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xa2e9242163d54b536583368a01b5d232c95aa884000000000000000000000653).\n\nGauge link [here 5](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc40F4ABc616Ab3136A002A667A7830F3F7dEC5FA).\n \n6. **Value:** **The pool is anticipated to generate significant trading volumes and fees for Balancer. The proposed ePENDLE/PENDLE+ pool strives to become a primary liquidity hub for both tokens, thereby bolstering market stability and depth on Balancer. We will promote this pool and provide bribe rewards to attract more liquidity.**\n\n**Specifications:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xc40F4ABc616Ab3136A002A667A7830F3F7dEC5FA`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
