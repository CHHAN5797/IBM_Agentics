        "title": "Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook",
        "author": "0xb29A655f3D67B2B6724Fb22B2C2303cB660c946B",
        "body": "Author\nSaurabh, Questbook \n\nType \n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n### **Abstract**\n\n- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/) , a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/) ) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n### **Rationale** **(Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. **Aligned allocation of funds:** By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. **Increased transparency:** The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. **Increased accountability:** With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. **Lower** **Turnaround Time (TAT):** The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. **An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours.** The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. **Strong Brand Recognition** : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas. \n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n\n \n![1.1.png](ipfs://bafkreicew52tsgud3subrurhrv6jud3zyep743fpgfiv4yzw54nnty423m)\n    \n\nWe propose  [Tally’s Zodiac Governor Module](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/using-governor-with-gnosis-safe/zodiac-governor-module-for-subdaos-and-grants-programs) for security purposes. Furthermore, a Grants SAFE with 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and 4 domain allocators. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/3 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n\n![1.2.png](ipfs://bafkreifk7yaqw2lvwj35tx2rumagctyd3of6nd2bh3fawsiij74bmdlyv4)\n\n## Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program and progress each selected project such as:\n  \n \n![13a.png](ipfs://bafybeihd4opx3atmhvarhrd5t6edpmpyfi4m6ptblpl4siihpqip5qh2wu)\n    \n    \n\n2. Grants Program: \na. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\nb. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\nc. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\nd. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n3. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unallocated funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n \n![14aaa.png](ipfs://bafybeig7zsa7e7vdk7zdnmspuq4z6ciajxorckhiy3ckpro4xfcv6ycheq)\n    \nP.S\n\n1. We are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Snapshot, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted.\n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum’s community call\n7. Increased engagement in builder community’s\nDiscourse\nDiscord, Telegram\nSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)\nGitHub\n\nSubjective\n1. Improved community involvement in the grants program\n2. Strengthened builders’ sentiment towards Arbitrum\n3. Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook’s role in Arbitrum’s Grant Program\n\n- Saurabh from Questbook will be the program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community. Saurabh was previously working very closely with the Program manager of Polygon, where he facilitated the disbursement of approximately $1 million in grants. Saurabh has received a grant from IoTeX to establish their grant program, and he works closely with the Program Manager of Compound Grants Program 2.0. Saurabh has spoken to more than 100 builders and teams over the last 6-8 months and understands what it takes to make a grant program successful - from both program manager and builder perspectives.\n- Questbook Grants tool will make sure the workflows are systematic and transparent.\n\n### Product Flows\n\n1.

        "body": "## **Summary**\n\nAs we near the end of allocating the initial grant budget (link to proposal), where through the [Arbitrum Grants Program ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/) run via the Delegated Domain Allocation model by Questbook, $912k has already been allocated to over 60 proposals. Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum’s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:\n\n|Domain|Domain Allocator|Proposed Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|New Protocol Ideas|Jojo|$920,000|\n|Gaming|Adam|$920,000|\n|Dev Tooling|Juandi|$920,000|\n|Education, Growth, Community and Events|Cattin (Seed Latam)|$920,000|\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1. New Protocol Ideas - [Link ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/120s88WVycDyP2pUfgcT0eE8ILuribuayHDnd5aeZxbM/edit#heading=h.4th1bgre9sv4)\n2. Gaming - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt)\n3. Dev Tooling - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit)\n4. Education, Growth, Community and Events - [Link](https://www.notion.so/e8e86fbd9ee349beb0d9046607dae812?pvs=21)\n\n* We propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.\n* Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.\n* Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected duration\n* The increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using **[Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/)**. Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.\n\nWhile the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:\n\n* have better accountability for the increased soft cap\n* define a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)\n* define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completed\n* define a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.\n\nThe DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:\n\n* in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DA\n* in case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N*3.\n\nThe disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.\n\nTo ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.\n\nArbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February. If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWe propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.\nWe are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO. In case the program would be renewed with the same structure and people, or in case the milestone verification would come to an end before the due time, any leftover would be given back to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n|Role|Monthly Cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Program Manager and Questbook|$10000|$60,000*|\n|Domain Allocator|$8000|$192,000|\n|Overhead for extra 6 months|$8400|$50,400|\n|Operations Cost, Misc.||$10,000|\n||Totals:|$312,400|\n\n*Note: Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month, included in the numbers above with the PM’s payment.\n\nAs per the above, the current costs to run program would be 7.8% of the overall budget of the grant program.\n\n* We suggest that the grants committee continue with [Synapse ](https://www.synaps.io/) for KYC services and [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in) for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout the Arbitrum DDA program 1.\n* However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Arbitrum at the end of two quarters.\n\n### Read the whole proposal on the forum for Domain Allocator roles, responsibilities, KPIs, and Expectations",

This will be used as a project buffer with funds either deployed in support of the program, recycled into ecosystem development or returned to Arbitrum DAO.\n\nSuccessful completion of these deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:\n\n* Number of active developers\n* Dev Github quality\n* Delegate engagement satisfaction\n* Voter participation\n* Capture-resistance\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**\n\n* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops\n* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way\n* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**\n\n* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows\n* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**\n\n* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**\n\n* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success\n* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “we can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs\n\nWithin web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.\n\n### Centralised Grants Program: Problems\n \n![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)\n    \n* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program\n* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.\n* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding\n* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to “open the door” for those who they know or have worked with before.h.\n\n### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems\n\n![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)\n    \n* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.\n* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas…\n* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.\n* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.\n* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.\n* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.\n\n### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds.\n\nAt its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\n![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)\n    \n> 💡The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n* Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n* Domain expertise and knowledge\n* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission\n* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling\n* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism\n* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n\nThis is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\n\nThis is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n![88d617338384427ed53607b929264bc8b623ef43_2_624x281.png](ipfs://bafkreiaylf4ugerhg5c755rx2ffjydpjcri6sx7mohjrafoiuylihkijfy)\n    \n### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.\n\nWeb3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n### Multisig Management\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.\n\n> 💡 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n### Team\n\nPlurality Labs Team\n\n**Disruption Joe**\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million.

In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\n\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.\n\nIf successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1.

        "body": "Please view the full proposal text on the forum: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss/23737\n\n#### Non-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\nWe propose creating a structured multi-sig framework to facilitate funded programs within Arbitrum DAO to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency. \n\nAs of April 2024, the DAO administers six programs with a designated budget for multi-sig signing. The aggregate budgeted cost across these programs for signers stands at 158,000 ARB, with an annualized total expenditure, based on estimations, of 470,000 ARB or $627,840 at an ARB price of $1.34. This is a high cost for the DAO to pay on a purely operational function, especially **considering that these operational costs will likely rise as more programs are funded.** \n\nWe propose creating a “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS) to unlock significant cost-saving opportunities, lessen committee fragmentation, ensure signers are competent with multi-sigs, and reduce friction for contributors creating proposals. The MSS will comprise 12 elected individuals to all DAO-funded multi-sigs. They will be compensated a base USD amount, paid in ARB, for performing these services across the DAO. \n\nThis proposal also includes the optional steps to fund the implementation of r3gen monthly Token Flow reporting on inflows (revenue) and outflows (spend) across the DAO as well as providing detailed information and analysis on spending from MSS multisigs. Together, this proposal will help create a “backroom finance” function within the DAO that can be used across different initiatives. \n\nThe proposed changes offer the potential to generate substantial cost savings, estimated to be ~$315,000 per annum, while increasing efficiency, transparency, and security of DAO spending.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Arbitrum DAO oversees six programs which pay multi-sig signers. Each multi-sig typically has five signers, except for the STIP and STIP backfund programs, which share the same multi-sig and have nine signers budgeted for. \n\nThe full analysis detailed in the forum post underscores the operational unsustainability of the current expenditure level, with an annualised cost totalling $627,840 USD based on the average ARB price of $1.34 between August 7, 2023 and April 30, 2024, the period starting when Arbitrum DAO’s first multisig was funded.\n\nThe cost per transaction appears excessive when comparing these figures against the volume of unique transactions sent from each multi-sig. While analysis for all multi-sig wallets is included for completeness, the STIP/Backfund multi-sig provides the clearest picture of the “cost per transaction” due to its proximity to completion.\n\nThis analysis highlights the urgent need for restructuring and cost optimization within the Arbitrum DAO to ensure financial sustainability and operational efficiency in the long term.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting that the current structure has individuals appearing across multiple different multi-sigs, drawing income from each.\n\nCurrently, the DAO experiences a significant dispersion in its structure, where each funded program operates its own multi-sig. This fragmentation not only leads to redundancy but also elevates the overall cost of operations. Through the “Multi-sig Support Service” (MSS), we can eliminate these inefficiencies and significantly reduce unnecessary expenditure.\n\nAdditionally, individuals on multi-sigs are generally not elected, posing a challenge in consistently ensuring that only the most trusted and competent members manage these critical roles. By shifting to an elected model within the MSS, we can enhance transparency, accountability, and professionalism, ensuring that every signer meets a high standard of trust and competency.\n\nFinally, contributors currently face friction in advancing proposals due to the need to wrangle signers, which can delay or deter the proposal process. The MSS aims to streamline this process by providing a reliable and consistent team of signers to be included in proposals, thereby reducing the time and effort of contributors, and accelerating the pace at which the DAO can execute its initiatives.\n\nBy creating a structured multisig committee, process, and reporting cadence around spending, the DAO will be better equipped to service its plethora of proposals that require payments and maintain transparency around the programs.\n\n## Proposed solution\nThe proposed framework for the Arbitrum DAO aims to address these issues by:\n\n1. Arbitrum DAO elects 12 signers via Snapshot weighted voting, shielded with Shutter\n      * Signers, when submitting their application to join the MSS, may opt in to be an MSS Chair, who will be responsible for communicating to the DAO on the MSS’s behalf. The three opted-in signers with the highest weight according to Snapshot will be allocated MSS Chairs.\n2. For each new DAO initiative requiring a multisig, a new 12 signer multisig is set up.\n     * The signing threshold will be dependent on the total dollar denominated value of the wallet\n          i. 6/12: <$1M\n          ii. 7/12: $1M-$5M\n          iii. 8/12: $5M-$10m\n          iiii. 9/12 $10M-$50M\n3. Signers are paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB using spot price at the time of payment. The MSS Chairs will be paid $2500 per month in ARB using the spot price.\n     * We feel denominating the payment in a $ value is important to ensure the DAO pays a fair price for service rendered without the risk of ARB price movement leading to a series of overpayment or underpayment to signers for their duty. \n4. This will be paid out monthly from the MSS multi-sig, which will be a 6/12 including the entirety of the MSS.\n     * Payment for multisig signers will only start once the first new multisig is onboarded under the Multisig Support Service MSS structure.\n     * Existing multi-sigs have the option to “opt in” to the MSS structure. If they do so any existing ring-fenced budget for multisig signing should be sent directly to a new MSS multisig. An MSS Chair will coordinate with the Program to manage the transition process. We expect a gradual turnover given the incentives at play and that most multi-sigs will not opt into the transition process. \n5. The same process is repeated to onboard new MSS members 12 months after the first is complete (starting the process 4 months before the term is up to allow for ample time)\n\nWe suggest the program is capped at initiatives seeking funding of $50M or less. This will help ensure that the program is not bottlenecked by one single initiative. For programs seeking more than $50M in funding, we suggest inspiration in design be taken from this model while creating a dedicated multisig committee and process.",

A 2-month pilot sprint of the core team focused on executing the market consultation part of the scope.\n>2. Running a series of online and IRL events before, during and after the 2 month sprint dedicated to the creation of an Arbitrum Ecosystem Investment Thesis. This thesis will help integrate the various investment initiatives already being run or proposed to the DAO.\n\n\n### Shortcast\nhttps://x.com/Sinkas_/status/1796573051414302910\n\n### Full proposal text\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-pilot-phase-arbitrum-venture-initiative/24247\n\n## Context:\nThis proposal builds upon discussions during ETHDenver, and a subsequent six weeks of conducting the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI) Working Group.\n\nAs a result of the above, the AVI Working Group has identified existing pain points related to venture development and investment frameworks, and has proceeded to submit this proposal with the intent to formulate an eventual comprehensive go-to-market strategy for the AVI.\n\n\n## Abstract:\nThe AVI team’s mission is to grant the ArbitrumDAO an effective and practical knowledge base so as to equip delegates and future AVI contributors with the necessary toolkit to deploy the AVI Ecosystem Fund (or nomenclature equivalent).\n\n\n\n## Why conduct a pilot phase?\nOperating AVI represents a bold and pioneering initiative for blockchain ecosystems and as such it is also a complex undertaking that involves high capital needs. It also is one of several such initiatives the Arbitrum DAO that require complex stakeholder alignment around setting up legal and governance structures. Thus, it is not appropriate to rush before the relevant structures have been put in place. \n\nAt the same time, there is a significant opportunity cost in not progressing with good velocity on at least the components that can already clearly be acted on. A lean and pragmatic pilot phase to analyze key themes thoroughly and develop the necessary clarity, will provide us with a solid foundation to build on.\n\nA pilot phase will help us derisk the AVI initiative, provide a better understanding of the landscape and options at hand, surface and validate key assumptions, and engage and align key stakeholders. Running a pilot phase will help us refine and optimize our investment strategy to cater to investors and target developers of highest strategic significance and return potential to Arbitrum, while at the same time further fleshing out the next steps and cost assumptions. Ultimately, our goal is to foster iterative learning, robust and effective investment approach, and strong engagement from key ecosystem participants. \n\n\n## Pilot approach\nThe pilot sprint outputs intend to provide the DAO delegates and stakeholders with sufficient information to decide on advancing the Arbitrum Venture Initiative (AVI), or parts of it into the next phase of development. The sprint is designed to fund the operational team for 8 weeks and is the natural progression of our existing Working Group efforts. We will also be hosting the IRL thesis development event and online workshops before and after the core sprint. Thus, producing an overall timeline of up to 18 weeks.\n\nThe sprint will kick off in-depth research and workshops to identify opportunity areas (thesis development).\n\nThe pilot sprint will provide concrete data and analysis from various ecosystem participants and stakeholders. Armed with this information, we will have the strategic perspective (thesis development) ready for AVI’s operation.\n\n### Key Output // Deliverables\n- **Thesis Development Report:**\n  - A detailed thesis report outlining the strategic vision, objectives, and target areas for investment within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This should include:\n    - Identification of key sectors (e.g. within DeFi, Social, Consumer, DeSci, DePIN, etc) and their relevance to Arbitrum.\n    - Analysis of market trends, opportunities, and competitive landscape (while collaborating on any work done by other groups with clear overlap).\n    - Potential impact on the Arbitrum ecosystem and long-term value creation.\n    - Foundational hypothesis development on strategic relevance of key sectors and investee profiles.\n- **Market Consultation Findings:**\n  - A synthesis report from market consultations (Indicators in mind: 30 founders and 15 funds).

What happens if we don’t do this now?\n2. What is the outcome of this pilot proposal? How does that tie to a larger vision?\n3. How does this compare to other proposals? Aren't other people already working on this (Foundation, Treasury Working Group, GCP, M&A, BoB, Elixir, etc.)?\n4. Aren't there parts we need to wait to be established, like the VC entity or OpsCo?\n5. How does this relate to the OpsCo and GCP entities?\n6. Why is the IRL event not being done in Brussels?\n7. What does the timeline actually look like?\n8. Given the seniority of the team, why don't you already have a thesis? How come other initiatives seem to have more specific proposals?",

    "summary": "The proposal aims to create a pilot fund to enable early-stage initiatives that improve Arbitrum DAO's operations and governance through problem definition, alignment, and scoping work. The proposal includes funding mechanisms, an assessor role, and a collective intelligence exercise to identify key problem areas.

Historical similar proposals mostly failed when opposed, underscoring the importance of targeted support for operational improvements.",
