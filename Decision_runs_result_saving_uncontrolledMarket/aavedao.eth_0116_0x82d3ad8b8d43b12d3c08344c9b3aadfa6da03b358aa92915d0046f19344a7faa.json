The current instance of the GSMs issue GHO into circulating supply and offer no additional revenue beyond the fee for interacting with the GSM. To date, both GSMs have generated a combined 21.9K USD in fees. \n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidxpse554hufcrksjc2you63l3abqnublk4h4cyg6inwdsquvomdy)\n    \nWith only 16M of combined USDC and USDT in the GSMs, the opportunity cost of holding aTokens in the GSM to date is 138.5k for the Aave DAO. However, during more recent times when GHO has been trading above peg and both GSMs have reached there Exposure Caps, the daily opportunity cost in lost yield is ~1.6k, which is equivalent to ~575k when annualised.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifay4gngo2u65tapm7brryjh22qrrt7smxbitkqlj6sjl7ezxrnma)\n    \nThe proposed GSMs will enable funds held within the GSM to earn yield and for this yield to go the DAO's treasury. Due to the enhanced capital efficiency, the USDC Exposure and GHO Bucket Capacity of the GSM can be sized based upon the lesser of the following:\n\n* Preferred amount of USDC exposure; or,\n* Available exit liquidity in the USDC reserve.\n\nEither of the above options, compares favourably when determining GSM parameters relative to configuring the Exposure Capacity for peg stability. If additional capacity is needed, a USDT aToken GSM can be deployed. \n\nThe aToken yield acts as a proxy for Borrow Rate on the Aave v3 market. Meaning GHO Minted from the GSM generates aUSDC yield and GHO Borrowed on Aave v3 generates interest. The aUSDC revenue is available every block as it accrues, unlike the interest accruing from GHO debt which Aave only receives if the user repays their loan.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposed instance of the GSM is intended to replace the existing USDC GSM, will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO and utilizes the USDC surplus to mint aEthUSDC tokens. \n\naEthUSDC is instantly redeemable for USDC within the main Aave v3 deployment on Ethereum. The GSM can mint and burn aEthUSDC in exchange for USDC based upon user demand. \n\nSwap fees will be accumulated in GHO and surplus aEthUSDC will be claimable. A bot will be deployed to periodically claim the revenue to the DAO's treasury. \n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkU3-Tp6R.png)\n\nA detailed specification will be shared during the ARFC phase.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Launch aUSDC GSM on Ethereum\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-10-18\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying a new aUSDC GHO Stability Module (GSM) and migrating USDC from the existing GSM on Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAfter a successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb800d3ab766305fd57389101bc475f0220a8bd47699b0f850eec115f31ca22ee), the existing USDC GSM is to be replaced with an aUSDC GSM. Migrating to an aUSDC GSM is expected to improve the overall investment prospects of GHO by introducing a new aToken revenue stream for the DAO. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 19.56.00](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1H0cN3J1g.png)\n\nWith 8M of USDC from the existing GSM deposited into Aave v3, it would represent less than 10% of the available liquidity in the USDC Reserve. With sufficient growth upside remaining for the aUSDC GSM on Ethereum, the DAO can increase the amount of USDC backing GHO. In addition, separate instances of non USDC aToken GSMs can be deployed to diversify GHO's collateral across other reserves on Aave.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 19.22.47](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByubX43kkx.png)\n\nThe existing GSM implementation has USDC exposure capacity set at 8M units. When combined with another 8M of USDT, this represents over 10% of GHO's supply not generating any revenue for the DAO. The GHO Stewards elected to not pursue increasing the Exposure Capacity of USDC and USDT to encourage new GHO entering circulating supply via the main market. As a result, GHO traded above peg and it tooks several weeks for newly borrowed GHO to enter circulating supply.\n\nWith the introduction of yield generating assets within the GSM, the GHO Stewards are much more likely to increase the Bucket Capacity and Exposure Capacity of the aToken GSMs to support newly minted GHO entering circulating supply. This is expected to enable GHO to grow more freely whilst partially mitigating GHO trading above/bellow peg. In addition, the more capital is accrued there, the better safeguarded from an extended de-peg GHO is. GSM protects deviations on both sides\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below details the configuration of the aUSDC GSM.\n\n| Parameter                | Value  | \n| ------------------------ | :----: | \n| Bucket Capacity (GHO)     | 16.00M |\n| Exposure Capacity (USDC) |  8.00M |\n| Price Strategy           |  1:1   |\n| Freeze Lower Bound       | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound       | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee             |  0.00% |\n| Burn GHO Fee             |  0.20% | \n\nThe Exposure Capacity is to be increased by the GHO Stewards upon successful upgrade/migration.\n\nThe previous version of the USDC GSM is to be disabled and all liquidity migrated to the new version.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

Deploying a GSM on the Arbitrum network enables swaps to be filled without unnecessarily creating an arbitrage opportunity between networks. \n\nWith the LTIPP ARB grant coinciding with GHO being launched on Arbtirum, the Aave DAO can stimulate demand for GHO whilst also restricting the Bridge Facilitator mint cap to encourage users to mint GHO via the GSMs. User will also be able to swap USDC and USDT for GHO via aggregators that have integrated the GSM. This will lead to USDC and USDT being deposited into the GSM.\n\nWith a healthy balance of USDC and USDT in each respective GSM, the Bridge Facilitator cap can be raised more aggressively and a GHO Bucket Cap with Facilitor role can be introduced to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. \n\n# Specification\n\n\nThe below outline the proposed changes to be included in the governance proposal submission.\n\n## Ethereum\n\n### Arbitrum Focused Facilitator\n\n| Parameter  |     Value      | \n|    ---     |     :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units  | \n\n### CCIP Bucket Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|    ---     |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n## Arbitrum\n\n### CCIP Facilitator Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|     ---    |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n### GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the USDC and USDT GSMs that will be updated by the GHO Stewards post launch.\n\n| Parameter                         | Value   | \n| ------------------------             | :----:     | \n| Freeze Lower Bound        | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound        | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee                   | 0.05% |\n| Burn GHO Fee                  | 0.20% | \n| Supply Cap                       | 1.00M  |\n\nAny deviation from the above will be shared in the comments section below prior to the AIP being submited for vote.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n1.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy GHO Facilitator\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-10-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes creating a Facilitator entity on Ethereum to support GHO's expansion across several decentralised applications on various networks.\n\nThis proposal also includes the first integration, a 5M GHO deposit into Aave v3 on Arbitrum. Future proposals shall outline how and where GHO shall be deployed. \n\n# Motivation\n\nGHO was successfully launched on Arbitrum July 2nd 2024 with only the CCIP Bridge Facilitator on Arbitrum. Since then, growth has stalled with around 3% of GHO's supply located on Arbitrum.\n\nThis publication proposes creating a new Facilitator entity on Ethereum for the purpose of onboarding newly minted GHO to various applications on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche and other networks as GHO expands. \n\nUsing Aave v3 on Arbitrum as an example, the below provides a high level overview of the flow:\n\n* GHO is Minted on Ethereum;\n* Transferred to Arbitrum via the CCIP bridge; and,\n* GHO is deposited into Aave v3 on Arbitrum.\n\nThe facilitator will enable Aave DAO to onboard new GHO demand vectors while segregating risk from the existing Ethereum facilitator.\n\nThe new facilitator role will have independent minting and bucket capacity constraints specific to supporting each proposed integration.\n\nCollateralization of minted GHO will depend on the different use-cases and takes place on the respective dApp when users bring GHO into the circulating supply.\n\nBeyond an initial 5M of GHO being proposed for deployment into Aave v3 on Arbitrum, other destination(s) for newly Minted GHO are to be presented in separate [TEMP CHECK] proposals for Aave DAO approval. An example, a [TEMP CHECK] would be to Mint GHO to be deposited into a GHO Reserve on Aave v3 Lido instance.\n\n## Aave v3 Arbitrum \n\nAn initial 5M units of GHO be deposited into the existing GHO Reserve on Aave v3 on Arbitrum. The below image shows the overall flow of GHO from Eth to Arb and into Aave v3. \n\n![tokenlogic illustration 2|1920x1042](upload://q2K20iwUi5poiuQ9CUUCDH4qqH1.jpeg)\n\nDepositing 5M of GHO represents a ~22% of the GHO liquidity in the reserve and is expected to dilute the deposit rate and reduce the borrow rate. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-29 at 22.09.07|1650x158](upload://zpzHzakLKAXc3of28V9gFgh4WYO.png)\n\nUsers will then respond and a new equilibrium is found. After monitoring how the market reacts to this change, a separate proposal will detail any additional GHO to be minted and deposited into the reserve.\n\nTo ensure there is sufficient capacity in the GHO reserve, the Risk Stewards will increase the GHO Supply Cap as required to facilitate GHO being deposited.\n\nThe Aave DAO is to be the sole beneficiary of any revenue generated from GHO deposited into Aave. \n\nA separate proposal shall be required to deposit additional GHO into the reserve at a later date. \n\n## Specification \n\nThe below serves as a guide and is to be refined with input from Risk Service Providers during the ARFC stage of the governance process. \n\n| Parameter  |     Value          | \n|    -------     |     :-------:      |\n| Bucket Cap |     50M units  |\n| Mint Cap     |      5M Units   | \n\nThe GHO Stewards are to be responsible for determining when and how much to increase the GHO Mint Capacity and Bucket Capacity whilst using the fast track, Direct-to-AIP, process for implementing the proposed amendments. \n\nThe facilitator on Ethereum can generate and burn GHO tokens up to a certain bucket size. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3.

With the introduction of the facilitator, the Aave DAO is expected to be an early GHO liquidity provider with GHO from the Treasury and newly minted GHO being deposited into the reserve. \n\nIn the near future, a proposal to onboard sUSDe to Lido instance will be presented on the governance forum. Onboarding sUSDe is expected to drive significant demand for stablecoins on the Lido instance. A combination of making available liquidity, having an appropriate Borrow Rate and Borrow Cap enables the GHO Stewards to balance growing GHO's circulating supply and peg resilience. By providing liquidity on the Lido instance, the Aave DAO shall provid the initial bootstrapping liquidity in a very cost efficient manner and in doing so, enahnce the DAO's revenue generated from the Lido instance. GHO holders will be able to deposit GHO to earn the deposit yield whilst benefit from small than otherwise concentration risk within the reserve due to the DAO providing the bootstrapping liquidity.\n\nWith strong demand for GHO using wstETH as collateral resulting in 23.7% of GHO supply sourced from the Main market being backed by wstETH, this demonstrates that users actively seek to benefit from the capital efficiency of using an LST as collateral. Deploying additional GHO into the Lido instance is expected to further encourage this positive behavior, reinforcing the appeal of wstETH as a reliable, yield-bearing collateral for GHO.\n\n![chart illustration (4)|1920x1498](upload://qIys1ADMWsNuiamV1PvLDkwZZff.jpeg)\n\n# Specification\n\n![tokenlogic illustration 1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRhLcIZkx.png)\n\nThe below table details the amount of GHO to be Minted by the Facilitator to be deposited into Lido instance upon, or shortly after, listing GHO. This is to be implemented via two AIP submissions and contain any required Supply Cap increase to facilitate the Aave DAO depositing GHO into the reserve. \n\n| Parameter |   Value    | \n| -------   | :-------:  |\n| Mint      |  10M Units | \n\nThe GHO Stewards are responsible for determining how much and when to mint GHO that is to be deposited into the Lido instance of Aave v3. \n\nFuture proposals shall use the fast track, Direct-to-AIP, process for implementing GHO Steward proposed amendments. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will be submitted to implement the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
