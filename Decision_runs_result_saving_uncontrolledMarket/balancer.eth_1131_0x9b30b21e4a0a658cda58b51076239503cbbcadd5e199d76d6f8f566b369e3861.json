AG](https://www.bankfrick.li/en)) to authorized individuals/companies (KYC/KYB).\n\n* The KUMA Protocol is a decentralized entity governed by vMIMO token holders that leverages these NFTs and issues KUMA interest-bearing tokens (KIBTs), which are freely transferable erc-20 tokens. These interest-bearing tokens behave similarly to stablecoins whose balance increases automatically.\n\nCurrently, 3 KIBTs are deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Mantle & Linea:\n\n* FRK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 360 days French T-Bills.

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n\n# References/Useful links:\n\n### Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol):\n\nLink to:\n\n* Websites (paUSD): https://pausd.mimo.capital/\n* Documentation: https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/\n* Code: https://github.com/mimo-capital/mimo-defi\n* Social: https://twitter.com/mimo_labs & https://twitter.com/ParallelMoney\n* Audits: https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/ten-x-titan\n\n# Protocol Description:\n\n### Parallel Protocol\n\nThe Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the paUSD/stataPolUSDCn E-CLP pool is to increase the stability of paUSD and as well as its on-chain liquidity.\n\nThe capital efficiency of E-CLPs will help to quickly bootstrap a liquidity network for paUSD. This hub-and-spoke network will enable a liquid secondary market for paUSD & stataPolUSDCn to make it easier to exit from/ enter into paUSD.\n\nBy using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for paUSD & stataPolUSDCn. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\n* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)\n* paUSD (the Parallel USD stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Ethereum: [e-cs-kp-USD ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x01536b22ea06e4a315e3daaf05a12683ed4dc14c0000000000000000000005fc)\n* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (±554k $vlAURA) & BAL and the Parallel [Protocol treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b) currently holds 23k $vlAURA.\n* Mimo Labs is still buying AURA which will be locked to incentivize the liquidity.\n* MIMO (the Parallel governance token) already gauges on Balancer Ethereum & Polygon: [p-MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x3dbb91bdd5fc74c49146819ed58d7d204cf5a016000200000000000000000cfb) / [MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xee3959fd00a0b996d801fc34b7ce566bd037f5f500020000000000000000063e)\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1.

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n\n# References/Useful links:\n\n### Parallel Protocol (prev.

Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.\n\n### Angle Protocol\n\nAngle is a decentralized and over-collateralized stablecoin protocol composed of smart contracts running on open blockchains. It can be used to issue stablecoins designed to maintain the value of the assets they are pegged to.\n\nEURA (previously agEUR), pegged to the value of the Euro - €. EURA holders can stake their stablecoins for stEUR in order to earn a native € yield.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the PAR/EURA E-CLP pool is to increase the stability of PAR, the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and EURA, connect the Parallel and Angle ecosystems.\n\nThe capital efficiency of E-CLPs will help to quickly increase the liquidity for PAR & EURA. This hub-and-spoke network will enable a more liquid secondary market for PAR & EURA to make it easier to exit from/ enter into PAR & EURA.\n\nBy using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for PAR & EURA. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\n* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)\n* paUSD (the Parallel USD stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Ethereum: [e-cs-kp-USD ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x01536b22ea06e4a315e3daaf05a12683ed4dc14c0000000000000000000005fc)\n* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (±557k $vlAURA) & BAL and the Parallel [Protocol treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b) currently holds 23k $vlAURA.\n* Mimo Labs is still buying AURA which will be locked to incentivize the liquidity.\n* MIMO (the Parallel governance token) already gauges on Balancer Ethereum & Polygon: [p-MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x3dbb91bdd5fc74c49146819ed58d7d204cf5a016000200000000000000000cfb) / [MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xee3959fd00a0b996d801fc34b7ce566bd037f5f500020000000000000000063e)\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1.

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n\n# References/Useful links:\n\n### Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol):\n\nLink to:\n\n* Website: https://mimo.capital/\n* Documentation: https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/\n* Code: https://github.com/mimo-capital/mimo-defi\n* Social: https://twitter.com/mimo_labs & https://twitter.com/ParallelMoney\n* Audits: https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/ten-x-titan\n\n### Monerium:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Websites: https://monerium.com/\n* Code: https://github.com/monerium/\n* Social: https://twitter.com/monerium\n* Audits: none\n\n# Protocol Description:\n\n### Parallel Protocol\n\nThe Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.\n\n### Monerium\n\nMonerium is authorized and regulated as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI). Monerium offers services to residents of the European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland. Monerium is authorized to issue e-money tokens on blockchains.\n\nMonerium issues the EURe, a Euro stablecoin with a 102% backing. EURe is more than one-to-one backed in high-quality liquid assets and is redeemable on demand. Unlike a bank, an Electronic Money Institution can only safeguard customer funds but not make loans.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the PAR/EURe E-CLP pool is to increase the stability of PAR and EURe, the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and EURe, connect the Parallel and Monerium ecosystems and provide a fiat gateway to PAR & EURe holders on Ethereum. Together, these 4 points allow for building a Bonds DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe capital efficiency of E-CLPs will help to quickly bootstrap a liquidity network for PAR & EURe. This hub-and-spoke network will enable a liquid secondary market for PAR & EURe to make it easier to exit from/ enter into PAR & EURe.\n\nBy using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for PAR & EURe. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\n* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)\n* paUSD (the Parallel USD stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Ethereum: [e-cs-kp-USD](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x01536b22ea06e4a315e3daaf05a12683ed4dc14c0000000000000000000005fc)\n* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (±554k $vlAURA) & BAL and the Parallel [Protocol treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b) currently holds 23k $vlAURA.\n* Mimo Labs is still buying AURA which will be locked to incentivize the liquidity.\n* MIMO (the Parallel governance token) already gauges on Balancer Ethereum & Polygon: [p-MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x3dbb91bdd5fc74c49146819ed58d7d204cf5a016000200000000000000000cfb) / [MIMO/WETH 80/20](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xee3959fd00a0b996d801fc34b7ce566bd037f5f500020000000000000000063e)\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1. Governance:\n\n* Parallel Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (4 team members and 4 dao members [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders).\n  * Polygon PoS: 0x2046c0416A558C40cb112E5ebB0Ca764c3C5c32a\n  * Ethereum: 0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b\n  * Fantom: 0x174162ddecE9d0b7B68fd945e38c3372C4C818ba\n* Monerium: has no on-chain governance.\n\n2. Oracles:\n\n* Parallel mainly uses Chainlink price feeds for all its collateral assets.\n* EURe does not use any oracles. The value of EURe is guaranteed by 1:1 minting & redemption rate from/to fiat euro. EURe is legally recognised as euro.\n\n3. Audits:\n\n* Parallel: https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/ten-x-titan\n* EURe: [https://dev.EURe.com/docs/Stablecoin/audits](https://dev.euroe.com/docs/Stablecoin/audits)\n\n4. Assets & Centralizing vector:\n\n* PAR has a debt limit on each collateral, is partially collateralized by USDC (≈ 30%) and the ownership of the Parallel protocol and is held by a 5/8 multisig with 4 signers from Mimo Labs and 4 signers [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders.\n* EURe, Monerium is backed by Euros.\n\n5. Market history:\n\n* PAR has been live since April 2021 (on Ethereum); PAR is soft pegged to EUR\n* EURe has been live since May 2022 (on Polygon); as Monerium can be minted/redeemed against Euros, it has held its peg even though its low liquidity creates stability issues from time to time (always arbed).\n\n6. Value:\n\n* The PAR/EURe E-CLP pool will act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, etc.).\n\n# Contracts\n\n* PAR/EURe E-CLP Balancer Pool (Polygon): [0x121363653c22F1c8bccBbf1b1aA8e1af85929784](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x121363653c22F1c8bccBbf1b1aA8e1af85929784)\n* PAR token (Polygon): [0xe2aa7db6da1dae97c5f5c6914d285fbfcc32a128 ](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe2aa7db6da1dae97c5f5c6914d285fbfcc32a128)\n* EURe token (Polygon): [0x18ec0A6E18E5bc3784fDd3a3634b31245ab704F6](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x18ec0A6E18E5bc3784fDd3a3634b31245ab704F6)\n* Gauge: [0xA6B15fF334e170368c6f578587aC6B382774e3fd](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xA6B15fF334e170368c6f578587aC6B382774e3fd) (child) & [0x9b2defbf22be1ccd63f36dadf69842feb5e7b8df](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b2defbf22be1ccd63f36dadf69842feb5e7b8df) (root)\n\n# Technical Specifications\n> The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n> gauge(address): `0x9b2defbf22be1ccd63f36dadf69842feb5e7b8df`\n> gaugeType(string): `Polygon`\n\n> The Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling grantRole with the following arguments:\n> role: `0xae60dce27f51ce5815357b9f6b40f200557867f8222262a1646c005d09b7dfba`\n> This role corresponds to setRelativeWeightCap(uint256) on mainnet gauges and can be confirmed here https://github.com/balancer/balancer-deployments/blob/de8c3a52cb62185469dbbc90589afa83e5490760/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L726.\n> account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`\n> \n> The Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptorEntryPoint at `0xf5dECDB1f3d1ee384908Fbe16D2F0348AE43a9eA` and call performAction with\n> target: `0x9b2defbf22be1ccd63f36dadf69842feb5e7b8df` being the PAR/EURe root gauge and data `0x10d3eb0400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000470de4df820000` to set the cap to 2%\n> The Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling revokeRole with the following arguments:\n> role: `0xae60dce27f51ce5815357b9f6b40f200557867f8222262a1646c005d09b7dfba`\n> account: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` to revoke the previously assigned role to change gauge weights.",

AG](https://www.bankfrick.li/en)) to authorized individuals/companies (KYC/KYB).\n\n* The KUMA Protocol is a decentralized entity governed by vMIMO token holders that leverages these NFTs and issues KUMA interest-bearing tokens (KIBTs), which are freely transferable erc-20 tokens. These interest-bearing tokens behave similarly to stablecoins whose balance increases automatically.\n\nCurrently, 3 KIBTs are deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Mantle & Linea:\n\n* FRK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 357 days French T-Bills. (± 3,35% APR)\n* USK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFTs, themselves backed by US 12 months T-Bills. (± 4,5% APR)\n* EGK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 740 days Next.e.GO Mobile SE Corporate Bonds. (± 8,75% APR)\n\n### Parallel Protocol\n\nThe Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the e-cs-kp-usd pool is to increase the stability of paUSD and wUSK (1), the on-chain liquidity of both paUSD and wUSK (2), connect the Parallel and KUMA ecosystems (3) and providing a fiat gateway to paUSD & wUSK holders on Ethereum (4). Together, these 4 points allow for building a Bonds DeFi ecosystem.\n\n1. paUSD & wUSK peg:\n\n* paUSD is issued following the CDP model; if paUSD trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy paUSD cheaper and repay their debt; if paUSD trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow paUSD and sell them at a higher price; since wUSK can be exchanged for Bonds NFT, and can be sold for real USD, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and USD market to help maintain the paUSD peg; so if paUSD trades below or above its peg, anyone can perform an arbitrage without having to go through a CDP.\n* wUSK is an erc-4626 wrapper of USK. USK is issued by using the “swap” function on the KUMA Protocol, each USK are backed by Treasury Bonds NFT, if the peg is below the real price, KYC/KYB people are incentivized to buy USK and redeem the NFT, if the price is above the peg, NFT holders are incentivized to mint USK and sell them.\n\n2. On-chain liquidity:\nSince paUSD can be exchanged for USDC and wUSK which are redeemable for USD. Users can swap paUSD for wUSK and/or USDC then USD by buying/selling KUMA NFTs and/or redeem USDC for USD to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa.\n3. Connect ecosystems:\nThe wUSK/paUSD/USDC pool connects Parallel and its paUSD (essentially a way to borrow USD with various collateral) to KUMA and its wUSK (providing onchain US T-bills), enabling multiple use cases.\n\n* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: USK has a direct fiat on and off-ramp by buying/selling underlying KUMA NFTs.\n* It would also connect paUSD holders to the KUMA Bonds NFTs ecosystems.\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)\n* Mimo Labs has started building [positions](https://debank.com/profile/0x4a266739E40664e80470CC335120a2A1fA0B3F3f) in AURA (±175k $vlAURA) & BAL and the Parallel Protocol [treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b) currently holds 21k $vlAURA.\n* Mimo Labs is buying ±$25k AURA per month which are locked to incentivize the liquidity.\n* The Parallel DAO will also pay ±$1.5k voting incentives per week using the Paladin Quest vote marketplace to the pool (more details [here](https://gov.mimo.capital/t/mgp-14-adjust-mimo-tokens-incentives-repartition-on-ethereum-polygon-pos/292))\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1. Governance:\n\n* Parallel Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mimo.eth)) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (4 team members and 4 dao members [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders).\n  * Polygon PoS: 0x2046c0416A558C40cb112E5ebB0Ca764c3C5c32a\n  * Ethereum: 0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b\n  * Fantom: 0x174162ddecE9d0b7B68fd945e38c3372C4C818ba\n* KUMA Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/kumaprotocol.eth)) and decisions are executed through a 4/7 multi-sig (currently held by 7 team members, but a proposal to elect DAO members will take place later).\n  * Ethereum: 0xB5502747AABDCa21E832951b4caaF739dA33f450\n  * Polygon PoS: 0x1A1A402746FBe8bcFE0f7992AE27c4eD81A70156\n  * Linea: 0x1151d63eB6154843D4b4898cF4C63aF556642997\n  * Mantle: 0x37D1C94087643dFE5288F72cD1e4A6fde5b130A9\n\n2. Oracles: Parallel uses Chainlink and in-house build price feeds for all its collateral assets\n3. Audits:\n\n* Parallel: https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/ten-x-titan\n* KUMA: https://docs.kuma.bond/kuma-protocol/ressources/security-and-audits\n* Mimo Capital AG Proof of Reserve: https://app.kuma.bond/reserve\n\n4. paUSD has a debt limit on each collateral and the ownership of the Parallel protocol and is held by a 5/8 multisig with 4 signers from Mimo Labs and 4 signers [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders, renewed every 6 months. (more details [here](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/risk/risk-per-assets))\n5. wUSK is an erc-4626 wrapper of USK. USK is a freely transferable Interest Bearing token backed by US T-bills offering approximately 4,5% APR. The KUMA Protocol accepts to swap regulated NFTs (KUMA NFTs) backed by bonds in exchange of composable interest-bearing tokens (KIBT) based on the metadata of the NFT.\n6. wUSK Rate provider: Summary judgement: SAFE (https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/wUSDKRateProvider.md)\n7. Market history:\n\n* paUSD has been live since September 2023 (on Ethereum); paUSD is soft pegged to USD.\n* wUSK has been live since September 2023 (on Ethereum); wUSK is an erc-4626 wrapper of USK. wUSK accrue value according the T-bills yield.\n\n8. Value:\n\n* The wUSK/paUSD/USDC (e-cs-kp-usd) pool will act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, etc.).\n\n# Contracts\n\n* wUSK/paUSD/USDC (e-cs-kp-usd) Balancer Pool (Ethereum): (AMP 200; trading fees 0.05%): https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x01536b22ea06e4a315e3daaf05a12683ed4dc14c0000000000000000000005fc\n* USDC (Ethereum): https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\n* wUSK (Ethereum): https://etherscan.io/token/0xaf4ce7cd4f8891ecf1799878c3e9a35b8be57e09\n* paUSD token (Ethereum): https://etherscan.io/token/0x571f54d23cdf2211c83e9a0cbd92aca36c48fa02\n* Gauge: https://etherscan.io/token/0x3c8502E60eBD1e036E1d3906Fc34e9616218B6e5\n\nSpecification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x3c8502E60eBD1e036E1d3906Fc34e9616218B6e5`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
