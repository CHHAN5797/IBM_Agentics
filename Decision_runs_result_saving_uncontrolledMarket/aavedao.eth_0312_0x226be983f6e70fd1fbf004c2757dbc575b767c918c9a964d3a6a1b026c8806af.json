This will enable the ACI to enact incentive programs funded by BNB Chain ecosystem partners for all fdUSD markets, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave on the BNB Chain.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been in discussion with various parties that have a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 on the BNB Chain. In order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for fdUSD on BNB Chain. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. By setting the multisig as the emission manager for the fdUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets on the BNB Chain.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe ACI multisig address bnb:0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd will be set as Emissions manager.\n\nThe call to the setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract will be as follows:\n\n`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(fdUSD, 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd);`\n\nThis method will set the ACI multisig as the emission admin for the fdUSD token on BNB Chain Aave V3 markets.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is working with various BNB Chain ecosystem partners to define the emissions program for Aave v3 BNB Chain. ACI has not been paid by any third party for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

As a result, onboarding PYUSD into Aave has:\n\n- Built synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n- Offered Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n- Strengthened the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin.\n\nIn order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for PYUSD on Aave V3 Ethereum Market. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners.

This will enable the Metis Foundation to define and fund incentive programs for this Aave pool, promoting growth and expanding the user base of this new Aave V3 market.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Metis Foundation has expressed a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 Metis pool. By setting their wallet as the emission manager for the METIS token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Metis Foundation wallet address is as follows:\n\nEmission Admin Wallet (Metis Foundation): `0x97177cD80475f8b38945c1E77e12F0c9d50Ac84D`\n\nThe AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.\n\n`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(METIS, EMISSION_ADMIN);`\n\nThis method will set the Metis Foundation wallet as the emission admin for the METIS token.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.

This will enable Liquidity Observation Labs to define and fund incentive programs for all wstETH markets, including Scroll, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGovernance have already approved setting Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH on the current Aave V3 Markets. \n\nBut since Scroll market is live, the current ARFC is set to establish Liquidity Observation Labs as Emission manager for wstETH, aligning with the desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3. \n\nBy setting their wallet as the emission manager for the wstETH token, the Foundation will be able to directly fund incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Liquidity Observation Labs wallet address is:\n\nEmission Admin Wallet (Liquidity Observation Labs): [0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022)\n\nThe AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.\n\n`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(wstETH,[0xC18F11735C6a1941431cCC5BcF13AF0a052A5022],EMISSION_ADMIN);`\n\nThis method will set the Liquidity Observation Labs wallet as the emission admin for the wstETH token on Scroll, besides the current Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Gnosis V3 markets.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative has not been paid by Liquidity Observation Labs or any third party for this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3.
