        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] stkABPT - Emissions Update\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2025-04-03\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes reducing AAVE emissions to the stkABPT Safety Module category.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDuring 2025, AAVE liquidity is expected to transition away from stkABPT to a more diversified liquidity base.\n\nThe below outlines an overview of what to expect during 2025:\n\n* Reduction stkABPT emissions, eventually to 0;\n* Support AAVE liquidity across several networks;\n* Improved liquidity distribution amongst LPs; and,\n* Introduce Aave DAO liquidity provisions.\n\nThanks to a coordinated effort between Service Providers, AAVE token holders and Aerodrome, there is now AAVE liquidity on the Base network. The liquidity on Aerodrome was key to supporting the onboarding of AAVE to Aave Protocol on Base.\n\nThis publication focuses on implementing the first significant AAVE emission reduction to stkABPT holders.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 21.55.51](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ8k8uhaJg.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/stkbpt\n\n## stkABPT Category Performance\n\n### Yield \n\nThe chart below shows the value of the Balancer Protocol Token (BPT) staked in the stkABPT category of the Safety Module (SM) and the historical yield received by Liquidity Providers (LP) over the last 30 days. \n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 21.57.57](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1PwL_3pkx.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/stkbpt\n\nThe chart above shows the resulting yield from Swap Fees, wstETH and AAVE emissions. The high swap fee is due to this pooling being the primary source of DEX liquidity and the resulting arbitrage derived volumes.\n\n# AAVE/wstETH Impermanent Loss\n\nThe image below compares the investment performance of depositing $100k into the AAVE/wstETH pool at launch on 2023/07/10 until 2025/04/02 versus passively holding each of the underlying assets.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 21.59.35](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1xA8_2pJe.png)\n\nHolding AAVE and wstETH outside of the liquidity pool generates a return of $147,355 versus $141,781 by holding the BPT. This means the impermanent loss incurred by LPs exceeds the yield from wstETH and swap fee volume by 5,574 USD.\n\n### AAVE Emissions\n\nSince the pool was deployed, on average, stkABPT holders have received 12.24% in AAVE yield, 0.61% wstETH native yield and 2.74% swap fees for a Total yield of 15.51%. \n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 22.01.26](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJK4vO2aJl.png)\n\nOur [analysis](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/stkbpt) has shown depending on the compounding frequency of AAVE emission, the overall investment returns can vary widely. As a result, the affects of compounding has been omitted. \n\nIn return for holding stkABPT, users receive a premium relative to holding the underlying assets. The premium, 18.21% yield, compensates users for being exposed to the risk of impermanent loss, slashing and to Balancer v2. Do note this premium varies over time, it reduces when AAVE's price nominated in ETH increases and vice versa.\n\nThe below compares three different investment scenarios:\n\n- Hold AAVE and wstETH, $147,355 (47.35%); \n- Hold BPT with no AAVE Emissions, $141,781 (41.78%); and,\n- Hold stkABPT and retain AAVE Emissions, $165,561 (65.56%).\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 22.04.13](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkg9CvunaJl.png)\n\n## Liquidity Distribution\n\nWithin the stkBPT SM category, 5 addresses are responsible for over 71.84% of the liquidity. Whilst these addresses are long term LPs, having a more diversified LP distribution reduces the reliance on select few addresses.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 22.07.24](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC5udnTJx.png)\n\nBy supporting DEX liquidity on Arbitrum, Base and Ethereum, we hope to reduce the concentration amongst LPs and support creating broader utility for the AAVE token beyond Ethereum. By providing direct liquidity provisions, the Aave DAO can provide a certain minimum amount of liquidity as a means of reducing overall liquidity derived expenses. \n\nSeveral centralised exchanges are also in touch with tapping into \"AAVE staking\" yield that will be possible when the Umbrella and Aavenomic upgrades are live. This is expected to support greater adoption of AAVE across centralised exchanges. \n\nIn the near future, we are exploring deploying AAVE liquidity into a new Balancer v3 pool type well suited for volatile asset pairs. Pending having access to suitable data, this new pool could emerge as the preferred liquidity pool for AAVE liquidity on Balancer. \n\n## Swap Distribution\n\nAn in depth analysis of the AAVE swap volume routing via the liquidity pool shows that 95.71% of all swaps are users acquiring 400 AAVE or less. \n\n| ![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 21.09.36](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyaWov36ke.png) | ![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 21.14.09](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkg7nDhTkg.png) | \n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n\nThe number of swaps per 10 AAVE bin size shows a distribution heavily skewed towards smaller swap sizes with key round numbers, 100, 200, 300 and 400 AAVE swap sizes featuring heavily amongst the data. \n\n| ![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 21.26.51](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r17Vk_hT1l.png) | ![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 21.26.13](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyUxy_hT1e.png)| \n|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n\nWhen comparing swap volume to the TVL in the pool, the largest daily swap volume as a % of the pool was 11.61% on the 20th Jan 2025 totalling $43.27M USD in value. The table below shows the largest swaps routed via the pool and indicates a very long tail up to 2.1M USD in swap size distribution. \n\n![Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 21.46.37](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Z67On6yl.png)\n\n## stkABPT Emissions\n\nThe Aave DAO currently emitting 360 AAVE per day to stkBPT holders. Assuming a spot price of $150/AAVE, this is equivalent to $19.71M a year.\n\nThe yield from holding stkABPT relative to the underlying, 18.21%, compares favourable to holding stkAAVE at 4.72%. Given the slashing risk is 30% for both stkAAVE and stkBPT, the delta of 13.49% represents compensation for the additional Balancer exposure. \n\nThis publication proposes reducing AAVE emissions by one-third, to 240 AAVE/day. The resulting AAVE yield on stkBPT is estimated to reduce by 4.67%, to 11.96% at current rates whilst still comparing favourably to stkAAVE at a time when swap fees and the Lido Index rate is below historical averages.\n\nBased upon the swap size distribution routing through the pool, an overall reduction in TVL would not adversely affect users seeking to acquire AAVE. However, earning near 12% for providing liquidity in the current market is also an attractive investment option for LPs to consider.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal when implemented via AIP will reduce the AAVE emission rate. \n\n| SM Category | Current | Proposed |\n| :---------- | :-----: | :------: |\n|   stkABPT   | 360/day |  240/day | \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

By adding the GHO-USDC E-CLP, it is expected to significantly improve market depth as well as USDC liquidity with the SM.\n\nThe GHO/USDC E-CLP pool requires dual asset deposits when Liquidity Providers enter the pool and when GHO is trading at $1.000, the pool is mostly USDC (75%). The pool's liquidity distribution is optimised for swap volume with Peak liquidity at 0.9995 reflecting that GHO is more likely to trade just beneath $1.000 than over. The upper and lower liquidity range was set to optimise the efficiency of the liquidity whilst still providing some USDC depth to the lower bound. The below provides a graphic representation of the liquidity profile and composition of the pool for GHO priced in USDC. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-05-23 at 18.45.52](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkfJ-baQ0.png)\n\n| Description   | Value  |\n| ------------- |:------:|\n| Lower Bound   | $0.996 |\n| Upper Bound   | $1.001 |\n| Peak          | 0.9995 |\n| Amplification | 1,250  |\n\nFuther details on the pool can be found [here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x006d7e2166472f62f0e9e5c95e3a313e01caea74000200000000000000000690).\n\nThe ability to stake GHO liquidity pool tokens improves the value proposition of the SM by providing the dual service of deep GHO liquidity and protection in the case of protocol shortfall events. Additionally, Liquidity Providers (LPs) can also benefit from earning trading fees.\n\n# Specification\n\nCreate a new GHO/USDC E-CLP SM Category which accepts the following Balancer Protocol Token (BPT).\n\nBPT: `0x006D7e2166472F62F0E9E5c95E3a313E01CaeA74`\n\nThe following initial E-CLP SM parameter configuration is proposed optimizing emissions for a target liquidity of $5M at 20% APR:\n\n| Description            | Value              |\n| ---                    | :---:              |\n| Emissions Nomination   | GHO                |\n| Daily Emission         | 2,750              |\n| Slashing Rate          | 50%                |\n| Cooldown Period        | 20 days            |\n\nThis proposal also recommends that GHO/USDC E-LCP is included in FastPass with the following initial parameters:\n\n| Description            | Value              |\n| ---                    | :---:              |\n| FastPass Fee           | 100 bps            |\n| Fee Destination        | Collector Contract |\n| Daily Withdrawal Limit | 500k               |\n\nIn addition to the above, we also recommend implementing the strategy detailed in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gho-usdc-usdt-bpt-to-safety-module/15195) which enables the DAO via the vlAURA holding to vote BAL and AURA rewards to this SM Category. This option then enables the Aave DAO to use is strategic assets to partially sustain the SM category.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

A few days later, the GSMs started experiencing outflows resulting in GHO being burnt and USDC plus USDT reserves being distributing.\n\nNote: The composition of the Balancer 3pool started shifting on October 28th, prior to the GSM experiencing outflows on the 3rd November and eight days before the Curve NP Pool's composition began favouring GHO. This is due to the high amp in the 3pool and the current the fees configuration on the GSMs. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 13.29.01](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJehNJcQkg.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/liquidity-pools\n\nBetween the 4th to 10th November, ~16M units of GHO were burned and all but small amount of the 8M units of USDC and 8M units of USDT remain in the GSM.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 12.43.16](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1Vl9CFXkl.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/gho-stability-module\n\nThree Borrow Rate amendments were pushed by the GHO Stewards, 50bps on 7th November, 75bps on 12th November and 50bps on the 18th November. All three Borrow Rate increases were ineffective and demand from prevailing market conditions proving more influential with ETH trading from 2,720 USD on the 7th November to 3,204 USD on the 18th November.\n\nON the 11th November, DEX pools heavily nominated in GHO and the GSMs depleted, GHO's spot price began to come under pressure. On the 12th November, the GHO Stewards increased the Borrow Rate for a second time and reduced the Borrow Cap to prevent new GHO from being borrowed.\n\nOver the next few days, GHO was redeemed from Maverick and borrowed on Fluid, before being swapped to other assets which resulted in downwards pressure on the weak peg.\n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByK9d0Ymke.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/gho\n\nThe third Borrow Rate increase, 50 bps on the 18th November, had minimal affect and on the 20th November, the GHO Stewards increased the Borrow Rate by 300bps to recover the peg. \n\nThe 300bps increase was successful with 12.3M units of GHO being repaid. Soon afterwards, general stablecoin borrow rates increased across Aave v3 and this resulted in users borrowing GHO causing the peg to deteriorate. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 12.47.14](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJbkjAYm1l.png)\n\nA second 350bps Borrow Rate was implemented resulting in 14.5M units of GHO debt being repaid and resulted in GHO trading 0.999 USD.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 13.05.53](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJwrk19Q1x.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/borrow-rate\n\nThe Paraswap v6 integrating on the main frontend facilitated swaps into GHO helping recover the peg as users migrated away from GHO debt. The ability to change between to and from GHO debt on the frontend has proven to be both a critical growth and peg stability tool. \n\n## Ethereum\n\n### DEX Liquidity\n\nDuring Phase IV, buoyant market conditions resulted in GHO's peg to experiencing more volatility than the prior reporting period. \n\nThe returns from a 5M GHO to USDC swap is shown below and highlights the low quoted price impact of performing the swap. The primarily consideration in the image below is the spot pricing of GHO being 0.9980.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 13.48.58](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1jLK1cm1x.png)\nSource: https://swap.defillama.com\n\nOverall, AUM in G=DEX liquidity pools is $37M with around half, or 19.4M units, being nominated in GHO.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 14.39.52](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1dHBxcX1x.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/liquidity-pools\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 14.40.44](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rysuBg9mJx.png)\nSource: https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/liquidity-pools\n\nThe recent reduction in GHO within DEX liquidity pool correlates with GHO's circulating supply contracting due to users repaying GHO debt in response to the recent 350bps Borrow Rate increase.\n\nThe [wBTC/GHO/wstETH](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-tricrypto-31/deposit) Tricrypto Pool and [GHO/wstETH](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x7d98f308db99fdd04bbf4217a4be8809f38faa6400020000000000000000059b) 80/20 Weight Pool on Curve and Balancer respectively have been consolidated into [cbBTC/GHO/wETH](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-tricrypto-47/deposit) on Curve. The consolidation of two pools into a single pool is expected to result in a cost saving to the ALC. The timing of this was dictated by the largest LP in the 80/20 pool developing the ability to hedge both BTC and ETH price exposure. \n\n### Funding Rates\n\nPerp funding rates have increased significantly over recent weeks making providing liquidity in DEX pools less attractive. With asset prices generally trending higher, the GHO liquidity rewards have been able to continue offering a competitive yield. However, sustaining the amount of the liquidity is resulting in elevated spending levels. \n\n### InstadApp - Fluid Integration\n\nLaunching GHO on InstadApp's Fluid for lending has proven successful with over 12M of GHO deposited. The largest LP in this pool has a collateral and a GHO debt position on Aave.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 16.12.41](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJiboWcXkg.png)\n\nAhead of launching GHO as Smart Collateral and Smart Debt on Fluid, the ALC coordinated with GHO Stewards to recover the peg via second large Borrow Rate increase. The ALC views the Smart Collateral and Smart Debt features as beneficial for supporting swaps and providing deeper liquidity. \n\n### PYUSD/GHO Liquidity\n\nWith funding received, members of the ALC are actively working with various fund managers to source the GHO/PYUSD liquidity. Seeding this 8M of liquidity when GHO is at peg will help the ALC to retain GHO's peg. At the time of writing, the ALC expects the 8M of PYUSD/GHO liquidity to be seeded week starting 1st December 2024. \n\n<insert image of gyroscope profile here>\n\n### Royco\n\nWith the objective of stimulating demand for GHO in challenging market conditions, the ALC created and funded Quest on Royco to reward users for swapping USDC to GHO and staking the GHO for 30 days before being able to call the cool down function.\n\nThe Quest is targeting 5M of USDC being swapped to GHO to help rebalance the composition of the DEX liquidity pools.\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nGHO's growth on Arbitrum continues to be slow. \n\nIn collaboration with Paxos, the wUSDL/GHO pool on Balancer has been funded and the ALC is working with Paxos to progress this liquidity from a ComposableStable pool type on Balancer v2 to v3 and ideally into a Concentrated liquidity pool type.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 16.39.01](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJIVZMcXyx.png)\n\nGHO was proposed and approved as liquidity on Synthetix v3 and recently, the ALC received feedback for GHO to be added as both Liquidity and Margin on Synthetixs. A Pull Request is currently with the Synthetixs team for review to support onboarding GHO as Liquidity and Margin. \n\nGHO is expected to be listed on Synthetix v3 in the near future and are liaising with several funds regarding the prospect of providing liquidity to kick start the integration. \n\n# Phase V Lookahead\n\n## Ethereum\n\nIn response to recent peg volatility, the primary focus of the ALC is to retain the peg and create deep liquidity supportive of facilitating large swaps with minimal price impact.\n\n### Balancer v3\n\nEarly December Balancer v3 will launch without any gauges and with some incentives to attract liquidity. Several major GHO liquidity provider are yet to have had the opportunity to review Balancer v3's code base or audits. As a result, we expect the migration to v3 to take some time and may not be pursued until sometime in the new year when all the pools are configured with gauges via governance.\n\n### GHO on Aave Prime\n\nGHO is expected to be launched on the Prime instance of Aave v3 with initial seed liquidity provided by the DAO. The sUSDe eMode is expected to create strong demand for stablecoins and GHO alike. The initial seed liquidity is hopefully sufficient enough to entice users to borrow GHO. With adequate GHO debt in the reserve, this should create a high native yield for GHO deposits.\n\nThe introduction of dedicated Merit program may be used to help attract deposits.\n\n### Royco Quests\n\nPending the results of the initial Royco Quest, the ALC may continue to use Royco as a means of stimulating demand for GHO and promoting the adoption of GHO in other protocols. \n\nEncouraging GHO Smart Collateral and Smart Debt on Fluid and deposits into Gearbox when Pendle PTs are added remain near term opportunities for the ALC to consider. \n\n## Arbitrum\n\nWith the GHO intended for Arbitrum used for the INST purchase, the ALC still advocates for additional liquidity to be provided into Aave v3 to support the adoption of GHO on Arbitrum. This is most likely to be achieved with a new facilitator on Ethereum that leads to GHO being minted, bridged and deposited into Aave v3.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in the near future, we expect GHO to be listed on Synthetixs v3 as a deposit asset that earn yields and also as margin. Do note, any un-utilised liquidity is deposited into Aave v3 to earn yield.\n\nA USDe/aGHO ECLP was launched with x30 Sats and has achieved minimal inflows despite ample rewards. The ALC is likely to reduce spend on this pool and reprioritise this portion of the budget.\n\nThe ALC is continuing to explore other potential integrations for GHO on Arbitrum with a high frequency oracle being developed by Chainlink to enable new integrations that haven't been technically possible this far.\n\n## Base and Avalanche \n\nPhase V will oversee the deployment of GHO on Base and Avalanche, marking the first multi-chain expansion since GHO was successful launch on Arbitrum. These integrations aim to extend GHO’s adoption and utility to new ecosystems.\n\naToken GSMs are expected to help maintain the peg on each respectively network. Leveraging existing relationships, the ALC intends to promote DEX liquidity at launch and a Synthetix integration on Base soon after launch. \n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe below details some high-level GHO metrics:\n\n| Description | Ethereum Value | Arbitrum Value |Avalanche Value | Base Value |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------:  | :--------:  | :--------:  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M | 20M | 20M | 20M |\n| TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)  | 15M  | 7.5M | 7.5M | 7.5M|\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO  (< 33% for 3pools) | < 50% GHO  (< 33% for 3pools) | \n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC) | < 0.10%  | < 0.25%  | < 0.25%  | < 0.25%  |\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  | < 5.00%  |< 5.00%  |< 5.00%  |\n| Price level for >90% time | $0.995  | $0.995 | $0.995 | $0.995 |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next three months. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\n# Specification\n\nSwap the following assets to GHO and deposit into the Prime instance on Ethereum.\n\n| Ethereum         | \n| :--------------: | \n| aEthUSDT (1.25M) |\n| aEthUSDC (1.25M) | \n\nCreate an Allowance allowaing the ALC to withdraw GHO from the Prime instance for a total of 2,000,000 GHO.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: `0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] PYUSD Reserve Configuration Update & Incentive Campaign\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes amendments to the PYUSD Reserve in preparation for an upcoming incentive campaign.\n\nAdditionally, a co-incentive campaign is to be implemented to improve the PYUSD and GHO liquidity.\n\n# Motivation\n\nTrident Digital with support from PayPal, presents the Aave DAO with an opportunity to promote the adoption of PYUSD on Aave Protocol and PYUSD/GHO liquidity on Balancer for an initial 6 month period.\n\nEligible Aave Protocol users are expected to receive up to 4.00% APR in Liquidity Mining (LM) rewards made available by Trident Digital on behalf of PayPal.\n\nThe incentive program seeks to increase PYUSD deposits into Aave Protocol, targeting total deposits of 75M units. After achieving 75M units of aEthPYUSD circulating supply, the rewards budget is to be distributed pro-rata. \n\nTo prevent undesired rewards farming, an eligibility requirement is to be applied to discourage undesired behaviour. \n\nRewards are to be distributed as aEthPYUSD on a monthly basis via a merkle contract administered by the ACI team.\n\n## PYUSD Rewards\n\nPYUSD rewards are to be distributed at a fixed rate of 4.00% to eligible user on Aave v3 on Ethereum up to a threshold of 75M aEthPYUSD. After this threshold is achieved, rewards are to be distributed pro-rata to eligible users. \n\nEligible users can expect to earn the following rewards:\n\n* Deposit Yield from Aave Protocol\n* Additional 4.00% of [aEthPYUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C0d01AbF3e6aDfcA0989eBbA9d6e85dD58EaB1E)\n\nUsers actions are tracked with users to receive 4.00% APR x `Eligible Holding`\n\n*Note: This incentive program differs from others projects that measure Net PYUSD (deposits - debt) by inclusion of all aEthPYUSD in circulating supply.*\n\n**Eligibility Criteria**\n\nUsers are subject to the following eligibility criteria:\n\n`Eligible Holding` = `PYUSD aToken Holding`  - `Undesired Debt Token Holding` / `PYUSD Liquidation Threshold`\n\nUndesired Debt Token(s):\n\n* variableDebtEthPYUSD\n\nUsers who hold both the [aEthPYUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C0d01AbF3e6aDfcA0989eBbA9d6e85dD58EaB1E) deposit receipt token and the [variableDebtEthPYUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x57B67e4DE077085Fd0AF2174e9c14871BE664546) will be adversley affected as determine by the formula shown above.\n\nUpon launch of the program, the only `Undesired Debt Token Holding` is the PYUSD variable debt token. \n\n**Rewards Amendments**\n\nTrident Digital and PayPal reserve the right to amend the list of Undesired Debt Token(s). If any change is made, a comment will be shared below in the comments section informing users of the amendment to the rewards program.\n\nUpdates can only be made during the last week of each calendar month and are effective from the start of the following month.\n\n**Distribution of Rewards**\n\nDuring the first week of each new month, the @ACI team will distribute [aEthPYUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C0d01AbF3e6aDfcA0989eBbA9d6e85dD58EaB1E) rewards via a Merkle contract. This approach follows the same rational as the Merit program.\n\n**PYUSD Reserve Parameter Adjustments**\n\nTo streamline communication, any risk or borrow rate parameter adjustment affecting the PYUSD reserve are to be agreed ahead of any change being implemented. Trident Digital is to represent PayPal's interest in providing the incentive budget. \n\nAave DAO's Risk Service Providers remain the ultimate decision maker(s) as to if the DAO supports any proposed amendment. \n\n## PYUSD/GHO Liquidity \n\nAs part of the PYUSD growth iniative, a 8M PYUSD/GHO Elliptic Liquidity Pool (ECLP) with an asymmetric concentrated liquidity profile will be used on Balancer.\n\nThe pool will be funded and supported for an initial 6 month period. \n\n**Budget**\n\nThe 8M of liquidity is expected to cost ~14% APR. This cost is to be split 50/50 with the Aave DAO to provide up to 300k GHO.\n\nEarly discussions with prospective Liquidity Provider(s) (LP) has indicated a preference for direct payment outside of the Balancer and Aura Gauges. Some prospective LPs are considering holding GHO debt whilst providing liquidity. If this was to occur the net cost to Aave DAO would be less than otherwise. \n\nThis proposal requests an additional 300k GHO be made available to the ALC and for payments to be made directly to LP(s). \n\n## Key Performance Indicator\n\nThis proposal intends to attract PYUSD deposits on Aave Protocol, measured by aEthPYUSD circulating supply. \n\n**Aave Protocol Phase I**\n\n| Detail        | Amount |\n| ------------- | :----: |\n| Target        | 75M aEthPYUSD Circ.

        "body": "---\n\n[ARFC] Deploy BAL & aBAL from the Collector Contract\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham) and @dydymoon\nCreated: 2023-02-05 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents two options for deploying the approximately 100k BAL tokens being acquired by AIP 115 and the aBAL holding in the Ethereum Collector Contract, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nAIP 115 has been successfully implemented and Aave has acquired an additional 100k BAL on market. The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].\n\nAave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.\n\nOption 1) Locking veBAL.\nOption 2) Staking auraBAL.\n\nOption 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).\n\nA Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.\n\nAave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:\n\n* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].\n* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].\n* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].\n\nThis proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.\n\n## Option 1) Locking veBAL\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nIn Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.\n\n### What’s veBAL ?\n\nveBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc\n\n* **Gauge-weight Power**\nVoting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.\n\n* **Governance Power**\nVoting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.\n\n* **veBoost**\nLocking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.\n\n* **Protocol Fees**\n75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].\n\n### veBAL Position Overview\n\nBy maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].\n\nWith 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).\n\nBAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.\n\nAave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies\n* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n\nThe boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.\n\nThere remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].\n\n### veBAL yield overview\n\nThe veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:\n\n* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)\n* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)\n* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold\n\nIn the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week\n\nveBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92\n\n* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.\n\nIt’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.\n\n## Option 2) Staking auraBAL\n\nOption 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.\n\nAfter the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].\n\nDepositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.\n\nThe yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.\n\n* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.\n* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).\n* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.\n\nGrowing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.\n\nWith 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.\n\nBy staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].\n\nOption 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.\n\n## Comments\n\nTo help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.\n\nThere are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nTo summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|\n|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|\n|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|\n\nThe amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at\n\nLlama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:\n\n1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH\n2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap\n3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.\n![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)\nThe BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL\n4. Approve BAL on Cowswap\n5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH\n\n![|312x312](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NyamWu2oOW0-UTQrXfcgD2kR4Z6J64pqWmD2kFrcZd_8Ay-MrXsGlGtIXnKSbhcHjzvfFFMtGTc_Hlpuel5Qp0j8GevSPNkqB9AkPN5LZhQLmAW-c8jYmESZPCkEI4QkSc8QaOhdFarIytRV6uq2QNA)\n\nAave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.\n\nAt the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70\n$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56\n\nIn performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).\n\nThe number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.\n\n\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.\n\nThose considerations are:\n\n* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade\n* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]\n* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmVqWgpRmoEvvhvXZFepmAgYU5ZK9XpSs39MExEUpiJZw3\n[3] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484/19\n[5] https://dune.com/queries/782195/1395498\n[6] https://app.warden.vote/dashboard/\n[7] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ac1109d58b02b5b74f10d92fb816a9cdc4b198fd455cc2bb2fdbb52ae84f9e\n[8] https://etherscan.io/token/0x616e8BfA43F920657B3497DBf40D6b1A02D4608d?a=0x5e5ea2048475854a5702f5b8468a51ba1296efcc\n[9] https://dev.balancer.fi/resources/deploy-pools-from-factory/creation/aavelinearpool\n[10] https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n[11] https://app.aura.finance/#/lock\n[12] https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249\n[13] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [13].",
