Frax Finance has in the past done so in Aave v2 on Ethereum and has already stated on the Aave governance forum an interest in doing so on other deployments once FRAX is added.\n\nThe Frax Finance team could deploy a similar Aave Lending AMOs to Aave v3 after FRAX is listed.This will provide Aave users with access to FRAX and present an alternative to the four USD stable coins on Aave v3.\n\nUsers are able to borrow FRAX and earn yield across DeFi, such as on Curve Finance and Convex Finance.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?**\n\nThere is no link between the authors and the core teams of the asset.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token ?**\n\nSee summary.\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nFRAX is a popular stablecoin to borrow, with its Lending AMOs it is able to mint protocol-owned FRAX to ensure low interest rates.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nFRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.\n\n**5. How is the FRAX token currently used ?**\n\nFRAX is a popular stablecoin to borrow, with its Lending AMOs it is able to mint protocol-owned FRAX to ensure low interest rates.\n\n**6.

Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nThere is a multisig which can operate certain AMO contracts but cannot in any way change users’ FRAX balances, cannot freeze or pause any user’s funds, and cannot in any way alter the behavior of the protocol or sweep/rug collateral or value. There are no FRAX whitelists/blacklists in any capacity as it is entirely a bearer asset/decentralized exactly like DAI.\n\n**8.

Rocket Pools is expanding its support for rETH across the L2 ecosystem, first Optimism, now Arbitrum and soon Polygon. There are currently only Chainlink Oracles for Arbitrum and Ethereum. Thus, this publication presents listing rETH on Arbitrum ahead of Optimism.\n\nA new rETH liquidity pool and gauge has been created on Balancer v2 Arbitrum for rETH/bb-a-wETH. This pool will deposit wETH into Aave v3 on Arbitrum. Incentives are expected to follow soon. This publication is early and provides risk service providers adequate time to review the asset listing parameters whilst liquidity continues to grow.\n\nLST collateral types drive material borrowing revenue to Aave as users deposit the LST and borrow the corresponding network token. This is most evident on Ethereum where the LST- and wETH-yield-maximising loop is the source of the vast majority of wETH borrowing demand.\n\nBy providing LST diversification, Aave presents itself as a neutral platform offering users the choice between various LSTs. An added benefit of offering a variety of LSTs is the respective communities may elect to compete for user acquisition via Aave through offering incentives. This is currently happening on Aave v3 Polygon and Aave’s TVL has meaningfully increased from a relatively small base.\n\nRocket Pool offers Aave v3 users on Arbitrum an alternative to wstETH.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?**\n\nLlama does not receive any payments from Rocket Pool.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token ?**\n\nRocket Pool strives to embody the core ethos of Ethereum and DeFi, specifically the non-custodial, trustless nature that allows self-sovereignty to truly thrive. This leads to reduced Counter Party risk relative to other LST providers.\n\nRocket Pool stakers deposit ETH into the deposit pool, enabling a node operator to create a new Ethereum Network validator. You can stake as little as 0.01 ETH.\n\nIn doing so, users are given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH is deposited, and when the user deposited it. The ratio includes rewards that Rocket Pool node operators earn from:\n\n* The Ethereum network itself\n* Priority fees from block proposals\n* MEV rewards from block proposals\n\nrETH is a staked, interest earning wrapper of ETH that can be exchanged at any time. rETH is not a rebasing token and therefore represents a straight forward integration prospect for Aave.\n\nSince the Beacon Chain rewards, priority fees, and MEV rewards will constantly accumulate, this means that rETH's value effectively always increases relative to ETH. The rETH/ETH exchange rate is updated approximately every 24 hours based on the Ethereum network rewards earned by Rocket Pool node operators.\n\n![|602x436](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sMlYJ-qPHfY2tYHe1Mhs1wJksUHoMuahfUR_vD-nFYn3vVC34buszhgTZv8oSjGQVTKUsGLm1jzBlkLCoR1bN_gGG6QWZyxiXkHFeFvxympIK7fw8zOjmGqI-Qsw-ErQBhruZk_eby90o8WwKgescPc)\n\nFor details on how to stake ETH with Rocket Pool, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/). For those readers keen to learn more about rETH taxation implications, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token).\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nBy listing rETH as collateral, users benefit from staking rewards whilst taking out a loan.\n\nSimilar to other LSTs, there are a range of yield maximising strategies and lower carry cost leveraged trading strategies that users could deploy. Given the typically low borrowing cost for LSTs, users are able to borrow the LST and participate in yield strategies beyond the Aave protocol.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nRocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH development.\n\nRocket Pool is designed to cater to two main user groups; those that wish to participate in [tokenised staking using rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-2-5-tokenised-staking-48601d52d924#92b0) using as little as 0.01 ETH and those that wish to stake ETH and run a node in the network to help generate a higher return on investment than staking outside of the protocol due to commissions earned.\n\nFor more information on these two groups that make up the protocol, we'd highly recommend [reading article one in our explainer series](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd) that goes into great detail on how users can participate, be it via tokenised staking or running a node in the protocol.\n\nThe core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party. This is a principle directly linked to Ethereum and ETH itself, and a mindset used at every stage of the process as Rocket Pool has evolved.\n\n![|602x216](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fqwfASEawOZPpIGTuda282owPW_7OJNQ2sK-XLi1Bq4Y09EpnHnfcehIr7n-3jHDqu02Iw676wV8RwPq0KcoUn9V1wtRRXGDF-wCRDdRO5_atRmJ2x2UjjkDRlv9zbOV2hcV1-hcevUGvulZOzLIGJI)\n\n**5. How is the rETH token currently used ?**\n\nThe distribution of rETH is spread thinning across many addresses. According to Arbiscan, the largest holding is only 3.13% of supply on Arbitrum.\n\nrETH is new to Arbitrum and because of this, there are only a few extrinsic use cases. Providing liquidity on DEXs is one of the main use cases to date on mainnet and we expect this to be mirrored on Arbitrum. The new rETH/bb-a-wETH pool will soon receive incentives and will bootstrap a second liquidity pool complementing the existing Uniswap v3 pool.\n\nWith supporting liquidity and an oracle derived from DEX and CEX liquidity across several networks, Aave is positioned to be the dominant rETH lending/borrowing liquidity pool on Arbitrum. For reference, there is currently [$20.03M](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) of rETH deposits on Aave v3 Ethereum.\n\nFor further insights into how rETH is integrated across the ecosystem, please refer to this Rocket Pool community-maintained Defi Opportunities publication.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. rETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\n* The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities\n\n**8.

The protocol reduces ETH 2.0 staking capital and hardware requirements to increase Ethereum's decentralisation and security. Rocket Pool lets customers stake trustlessly to a network of node operators to do this.\nThe Ethereum 2.0 base protocol requires 32 ETH, technical competence, and a machine with a CPU processor with four cores and a minimum clock speed of 2.80 gigahertz. Without a way to lessen the costs to admission for ETH holders, these restrictions would endanger decentralisation and network security. Even if consumers could stake, their ETH would be illiquid until a predefined lock-up period, which would degrade the staker experience. Rocket Pool users will be locked up until Ethereum 2.0 phase 2.\n\n#### _Isolation mode_\nAdding support for RPL on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow RPL holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their RPL position, boosting the RPL stablecoin utlization rate and attracting new RPL Deposits.\n\n#### _Oracles_\nOngoing integration via Chainlink.\n\n## Specification\n\n#### _What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?_\n\nStableLabs & ACI have no link and are not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal\n\n#### _Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token._\nRocket Pool is Ethereum 2.0 staking. The protocol reduces ETH 2.0 staking capital and hardware requirements to increase Ethereum's decentralisation and security. Rocket Pool lets customers stake trustlessly to a network of node operators to do this.\nThe Ethereum 2.0 base protocol requires 32 ETH, technical competence, and a machine with a CPU processor with four cores and a minimum clock speed of 2.80 gigahertz. Without a way to lessen the costs to admission for ETH holders, these restrictions would endanger decentralisation and network security. Even if consumers could stake, their ETH would be iliquid until a predefined lock-up period, which would degrade the staker experience. Rocket Pool users will be locked up until Ethereum 2.0 phase 2.\nRPL Token Ethereum Address: 0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f\n\n#### _Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?_\nRPL is the governance and utility token for RocketPool, as the governance token for a major decentralized liquid staking derivative protocol, RocketPool has solidified itself as a Protocol which is actively contributing to Ethereum’s decentralization by making Operating a Node easy and accessible. By supporting RPL on Aave V3 Ethereum we would create an alternative for RPL holders who wish to earn yield on their asset.\n\n#### _Non-collateral onboarding_\nAdding support for RPL on Ethereum V3 as a non-collateral asset would allow RPL holders to obtain a yield on their RPL holdings. Users will borrow RPL mainly to allow them to deploy mini-pools and start staking.\n\n#### _Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?_\nAs it became evident that Ethereum would switch from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, David Rugendyke established Rocket Pool in 2016. A minimum of 32 ETH, some technical know-how, and a computer with a CPU processor with four cores and a minimum clock speed of 2.80 gigahertz would be needed to validate on the Ethereum 2.0 base protocol. \nThese obstacles would endanger the network's decentralisation and security in the absence of a solution that lowered the admission barriers for ETH holders. Additionally, even if users were able to stake, their ETH would stay non-liquid until a predefined lock-up period had passed, which would worsen the stakers' user experience. Users will be subject to his lock-up period until phase 2 of the rollout of Ethereum 2.0, even on Rocket Pool.\n\n#### _How is RPL currently used?_\nRPL is actively being used to power the RocketPool Protocol, the RPL mechanics are used in multiple key places to drive the protocol forward.\n— rETH value is protected by node operators staking RPL as insurance for a proper service. In the event that node operators perform poorly, the staked RPL is used as insurance.\n— The RocketPool Protocol also has Oracle DAO members who post RPL bonds as an assurance of good behavior.\n—  RPL is also used in RocketPool Protocol DAO Governance.\nRPL is also being used to provide liquidity on Uniswap and Balancer\n\n#### _Emission schedule_\nRPL is distributed as follows 15% for Oracle DAO members who contribute a variety of Oracle data, 70% for node operators who stake RPL as insurance collateral, and another 15% for the Protocol DAO Treasury, which supports decentralized development.\n\n#### _Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?_\nThe RocketPool Protocol is owned and managed by the RocketPool Protocol DAO. The RocketPool DAO runs a Snapshot Subspace where they vote on Governance Proposals. \n\nRPL Contract: [0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f)\n\nThe direction of the RocketPool protocol is shaped by the Rocket Pool Protocol DAO (pDAO), which is managed by RPL governance. A square root modifier transmits pDAO voting power from node operators' effective staked RPL.\nWithin Rocket Pool, Node Operators may submit and vote on new Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals (RPIP). For RPL, the RocketPool DAO controls all admin actions.\n\n#### _Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)_\nMarket capitalisation: $917,000,000\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\nUniswap V3\nETH/RPL (20/80) - 0xe42318eA3b998e8355a3Da364EB9D48eC725Eb45\n\n#### _Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)_\nDiscord: 19,778\nTwitter: 40.6K\nGithub: 115\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of Deployment: September 2017 \nNumber of transactions: 196,206\nNumber of token holders: 8,351\n\n#### _Risk parameters_\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams, we suggest the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\n**Symbol: RPL**\n\nContract Address: [0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f)\n\n| Parameter          | Value |\n|--------------------|-------|\n| Isolation Mode     | NO    |\n| Borrowable         | YES   |\n| Collateral Enabled | NO    |\n| LTV                | 0   |\n| LT                 | N/A   |\n| LB                 | N/A   |\n| Debt Ceiling       | N/A   |\n| Reserve Factor     | 20%   |\n| Supply Cap         | 3M    |\n| Borrow Cap         | 2M    |",

USDC lenders receive the corresponding fUSDC, representing their right to reclaim the underlying USDC plus accrued interest, and which can be freely transferred. Positions are collateralized by OUSG, which is invested into Blackrock’s SHV ETF (with a small portion of USD and USDC for liquidity purposes). Read more on OUSG [here](https://ondo.finance/ousg).\n\nfUSDC is a new financial primitive with arguably the **best risk-adjusted yield** available in DeFi.\n\n*Isolated mode*\n\nAdding support for fUSDC on Ethereum V3 in **isolated mode** would allow fUSDC holders to borrow stablecoins on Aave and leverage their fUSDC position, boosting the stablecoin utilization rate on Aave, while attracting new stablecoin deposits thanks to boosted supply rates.\n\nFor example, as the fUSDC yield [oscillates around 4% APR](https://fluxfinance.com/market/usdc), borrowing USDC on Aave should be profitable up to [90% utilization rate](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3).\n\n\n![image|690x307](upload://p0A7wVqcMZT8osi6JwSn3YzsKcr.png)\n\nUSDC IR model on Aave eth V3. A 90% utilization rate would align Aave borrow and Flux supply APR.\n\n**Oracles:** A custom Oracle audited and ready to be deployed leveraging the fUSDC/USDC Flux exchange rate and piggybacks to the USDC chainlink oracle.\n\nfUSDC is not a traded token and therefore does not have or need a chainlink oracle based on trade volumes.\n\n## Specification\n\n#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe ACI is an independent service provider to the Aave DAO, while Ondo finance provided support & Data for the creation of this TEMP check, the ACI is not linked nor paid by Ondo to publish this AIP\n\n#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nFlux Finance is a fork of Compound V2, with minor changes to support permissioned tokens such as Ondo Finance’s Short-Term U.S. Government Bond Fund (OUSG), alongside permissionless tokens, such as USDC. USDC lenders receive the corresponding fUSDC, representing their right to reclaim the underlying USDC plus accrued interest, and which can be freely transferred. Positions are collateralized by OUSG, which is invested into Blackrock’s SHV ETF (with a small portion of USD and USDC for liquidity purposes). Read more on OUSG [here](https://ondo.finance/ousg).\n\nfUSDC is a new financial primitive with arguably the **best risk-adjusted yield** available in DeFi.\n\nfUSDC Token Ethereum Address: `0x465a5a630482f3abD6d3b84B39B29b07214d19e5`\n\n1. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\n*Isolated mode*\n\nAdding support for fUSDC on Ethereum V3 in **isolated mode** would allow fUSDC holders to borrow stablecoins on Aave and leverage their fUSDC position, boosting the stablecoin utilization rate on Aave, while attracting new stablecoin deposits thanks to boosted supply rates.\n\nFor example, as the fUSDC yield [oscillates around 4% APR](https://fluxfinance.com/market/usdc), borrowing USDC on Aave should be  profitable up to [90% utilization rate](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3).\n\n*Avoid using fUSDC as a borrowable asset*\n\nfUSDC can be exposed to price manipulation (up-only via donation). As this can put borrowers under liquidation risk in case of price manipulation, fUSDC should not be added as a borrowable asset.\nThe recent issue with 0vix and vGHST asset is a prime example of this potential vector of risk.\n\n#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFlux is governed by the Ondo DAO, which went live on January 12th 2023. Its first Flux markets got initialized on February 3rd 2023.\n\nFlux offers yield opportunities to stablecoin lenders (USDC, DAI, USDT, FRAX), while allowing OUSG investors to borrow stablecoins against their underlying tokenized US Treasuries.\n\n#### How is fUSDC currently used?\n\nHolding fUSDC allows users to earn a yield on their USDC.\n\nfUSDC can also be used as a RToken collateral, launched by the [Reserve Protocol](https://twitter.com/reserveprotocol)\n[https://twitter.com/FluxDeFi/status/1643350249207889920?s=20](https://twitter.com/FluxDeFi/status/1643350249207889920?s=20)\n\n#### Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule. fUSDC is minted or burned based on deposits or withdrawals of USDC.\n\n#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nThe Flux Lending Market and fUSDC contracts are owned by the Ondo DAO. The Ondo DAO is gated behind a 3 day voting period and 1 day time lock. \n\nSimilar to Compound, Flux has upgradeable comptroller and fToken (cToken) contracts. \n\n- Flux’s Comptroller Contract: `0x95Af143a021DF745bc78e845b54591C53a8B3A51`\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x95Af143a021DF745bc78e845b54591C53a8B3A51](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95Af143a021DF745bc78e845b54591C53a8B3A51)\n- Flux’s fUSDC Contract: `0x465a5a630482f3abD6d3b84B39B29b07214d19e5`\n    \n    [https://etherscan.io/address/0x465a5a630482f3abD6d3b84B39B29b07214d19e5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x465a5a630482f3abD6d3b84B39B29b07214d19e5)\n    \n\nFor the Comptroller, the Ondo DAO controls all admin actions, including initializing markets, setting collateral factors, setting the close factor, setting the price oracle, setting borrow caps, and all pause actions below. A 3/n multisig (`0x118919e891D0205A7492650AD32E727617FA9452`)  controlled by the Flux team acts as the `pauseGuardian`, which can pause transfers, liquidations, mints, and borrows.\n\nFor fUSDC, the Ondo DAO controls all admin actions, including setting the interest rate model, comptroller, reserve factor, and KYC registry. The KYC registry is controlled by the Ondo 3/n team multisig and gates which users can be permissioned security token holders and permissioned borrowers.\n\nCurrently, the InterestRateModel and Oracle contracts are controlled by the Flux team’s 3/n multisig. The Oracle contract allows a 3/n multisig to set the underlying asset’s hardcoded price or Chainlink price feed. The InterestRateModel contract sets the interest rate curve for the markets. Post an upcoming vote (week of April 24, 2023), both of these non-upgradeable contracts will be controlled by the Ondo DAO. \n\n#### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market capitalisation: $7,091,198\n\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\n\nCurve\n\n- [fUSDC/fDAI (50/50) - 0x5105a9E847965421a8C81cA33Ea682948694A6F4](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crypto-237/deposit)\n\n####  Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\n- Discord: 22,304 members\n- Twitter: 3283 followers\n- Github: 4 followers\n\n#### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: [3rd February 2023](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ondo-dao/proposal/3) (after the vote ended)\n- Number of transactions: 802\n- Number of token holders: 400\n\n## Risk Management\n\nfUSDC is collateralized by OUSG, which is invested into Blackrock’s SHV ETF (with a small portion of USD and USDC for liquidity purposes). The underlying assets in the SHV ETF have a very low risk profile, and the ETF itself is highly liquid.\n\nTo mitigate risk, we suggest implementing the following risk parameters for fUSDC:\n\n- Loan to Value (LTV): 75%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 80%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 5%\n- Reserve Factor: 10%\n- Interest Rate Strategy: Similar to USDC\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdding support for fUSDC on Ethereum v3 in isolated mode has the potential to attract new stablecoin deposits, increase stablecoin utilization rates on Aave, and provide additional opportunities for users to leverage their fUSDC positions.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback: Engage with the Aave community to collect feedback and address any concerns or suggestions.\n2. Publish a temperature check snapshot vote: Conduct a preliminary snapshot vote to gauge community sentiment on the proposal.\n3. Escalate to ARFC stage: If the temperature check is favorable, move the proposal to the Aave Request for Comments (ARFC) stage for further discussion and refinement.\n4. Gather feedback from risk service providers: Consult with risk assessment teams like Gauntlet and Chaos Labs to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of adding fUSDC as collateral.\n5. Escalate to ARFC snapshot vote: If the risk assessment is positive and community feedback is supportive, proceed to an official ARFC snapshot vote.\n6. Escalate to AIP stage: If the ARFC snapshot vote passes, move the proposal to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval and implementation.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK is released under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication.

This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH.\n\nLSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.\n\nOnboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.\n\nAave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.\n\nRocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem.\n\nSpecification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal.\nIncreasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions.\n\nthe ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators.\nRocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH\nrETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH.\nThe rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time.\nSimply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.\nWithout a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.\nRocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold.\nAbstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nrETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.\nrETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.\nrETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.\nrETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.\nrETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years.\nThe Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021.\nrETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2\nThe Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool — Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2\n5. How is the rETH token currently used?\n\nBalancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M\n\nUniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity\n\nrETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI\n\nimage\nimage\n1231×203 17.2 KB\nIt’s likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding.\n\nSee the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\nrETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\nThe Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities.\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $287 118 738\n24H Volume ~$3.75M\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\n\nExchanges:\n\nBalancer (main source of liquidity)\nUniswap\nCurve\nBancor\nFurther information here: Rocket Pool Explorer 4 2 and Dune 1\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 17770 1 members\nTwitter: 34548 followers\nGithub: 66 followers\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nThe below applies to just wstETH on Optimism:\n\nDate of Deployment: Sep 30th 2021\nNumber of Transactions: 73358\nNumber of holders for token: 9104 (liquidity pools are recorded as 1 address)\nTechnical Specifications\nA comprehensive technical analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO technical team here is their report:\n\n[rETH] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Technical Assessment 2\n\nSecurity Considerations\nRocketPool smart contracts have been independently audited by three best-in-class audit firms:\n\nhttps://rocketpool.net/files/sigma-prime-audit.pdf 1\nRocketpool | ConsenSys Diligence\npublications/RocketPool.pdf at master · trailofbits/publications · GitHub 1\nbug bounty: https://immunefi.com/bounty/rocketpool/\n\nRisk Analysis\nA comprehensive risk analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO risk team here is their report:\n\n[rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation 9\n\nRisk parameters\nThe Following Risk parameters are the result of Chaos Labs & Gauntlet risk teams joint work.\n\nAs such, we recommend the following parameters:\n\nIsolation Mode - No\n\nWhile isolation mode provides newer, untested assets a safe backdrop to evolve, by only allowing stablecoin borrowing, in the context of rETH however, it excludes potentially the largest use case of rETH collateral, which is to borrow correlated assets in WETH or wstETH. Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.\n\nBorrowable - Yes\n\nWe are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aave’s markets.\n\nLT - 74%; LTV 67%\n\nWe recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we’ve identified above.\n\nLB - 7.5%\n\nWe recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH.\n\nRF - 15%\n\nLPF - 0.1\n\nDebt Ceiling - NA\n\nSupply Cap - 10K\n\nBorrow Cap - 1200\n\nOur analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets.\n\n| Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap |\n| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |\n| rETH   | NO             | YES        | YES                | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A         | 10K       | 1200      |\n\n\n## Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor\n\nrETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later.\n\nParameter | Recommendation\n--------- | -------------\nBase | 0\nSlope 1 | 0.07\nUoptimal | 0.45\nSlope 2 | 3.0\nReserve Factor | 0.15\n\nUnder these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI). From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.",
