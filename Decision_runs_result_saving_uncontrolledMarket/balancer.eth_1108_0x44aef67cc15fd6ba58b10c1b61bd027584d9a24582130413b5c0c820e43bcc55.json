        "body": "## Intro\n\nFollowing the recent [withdrawal of funding proposals for marketing](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-marketing-team-selection-for-january-june-2025-withdrawn/6296) service providers, the Balancer community has engaged in productive discussions regarding the optimal structure and strategy for promoting the protocol. The Foundation has actively participated in these conversations, gathering feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders and marketing professionals. \n\nThis proposal outlines a revised approach to Balancer's marketing efforts, shifting away from direct DAO funding of individual initiatives and towards a more strategic, Foundation-led model. This transition aims to prioritize long-term brand building while simultaneously driving measurable results aligned with community objectives.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThe previous marketing funding model, while well-intentioned, presented challenges in achieving consistent, impactful results. Direct DAO funding of previous providers lacked a cohesive strategy and often struggled to balance long-term brand development with immediate, measurable outcomes. The recent funding proposal withdrawals, with failure on reaching soft-consensus before vote, highlighted the need for a more structured and accountable approach.\n\n**Proposed Solution: A Foundation-Managed Marketing Fund**\n\nThis proposal requests the allocation of $99,000 USD to the Balancer Foundation multisig. These funds will be earmarked for salaries/contractors, retroactively and beyond, with a new hire of a FT marketing professional for the next 6mo. So far, the Foundation absorbed marketing costs from previous savings, but we need a proper allocation to ensure effective continuation of all services.\n\nIn the following months, we will present a proposal for execution of a comprehensive marketing strategy, managed by the Foundation but overseen by long-term contributors and stakeholders, such as Maxis and BD, Balancer Labs, and BAL wrappers.\n\nThis Foundation-led model mirrors the successful approach currently employed for the Balancer frontend development. The frontend team, a critical component of the Balancer product, operates under a similar structure, receiving funding through the Foundation under direction of the DAO. This integrated approach ensures that frontend development is strategically aligned with the overall product roadmap and efficiently utilizes resources. Just as the frontend is an integral part of the product, marketing plays an equally crucial role in its success.\n\nThis unified approach maximizes efficiency, fosters collaboration, and ultimately strengthens the entire Balancer ecosystem:\n\n* **Strategic Alignment:** The Foundation will implement a unified marketing strategy that aligns with the overall goals and vision of the Balancer protocol. This strategy will be informed by ongoing dialogue with community stakeholders and delegates, ensuring that marketing efforts reflect the collective priorities.\n* **Professional Expertise:** The allocated funds will enable the Foundation to engage experienced marketing professionals, agencies, and consultants with specialized skills in areas such as branding, copywriting, social media management, public relations, and community engagement. This ensures access to top-tier talent and expertise.\n* **Accountability and Transparency:** The Foundation will provide regular reports to the community on the progress of marketing initiatives, including key performance indicators (KPIs) and budget allocation. This fosters transparency and accountability in the use of funds ([example of Product team community updates](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/opco-product-team-jan-2025-update/6335))\n* **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The Foundation-managed model allows for greater flexibility in responding to evolving market conditions and community feedback. Resources can be strategically allocated and adjusted as needed to maximize impact.\n* **Long-Term Brand Building:** While addressing immediate needs, this approach emphasizes the development of a strong, enduring brand for Balancer. This includes crafting a compelling narrative, enhancing brand recognition, and fostering a vibrant and engaged community.\n\n## Use of Funds\n\nThe $99,000 USDC allocation will be used to cover salary and contractor services, including but not limited to:\n\n* **Retroactive Collaborations (Jan/Feb):** A portion of the funds will be allocated to compensate for marketing contributions during the period between funding proposal withdrawals and the implementation of this new model. This ensures that contributors are fairly compensated for their past work.\n* **Professional Services:** The majority of the funds will be used to hire one full-time marketing professional.\n* **Discretionary budget:** Allocation to freelancers for artwork, designs, campaigns etc.\n\nAdditionally, the new marketing team requests the remaining allocation from [[BIP-738]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-738-request-for-additional-marketing-funding-to-maximize-balancer-v3-launch-impact/6190) and [[BIP-612]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-612-funding-for-live-event-participation/5768/5) to be kept under the Foundation for further enhancing the v3 campaigns, given the efforts were discontinued after the Marketing SP proposal was withdrawn.\n\n|Topic|Allocated funds ($)|\n| --- | --- |\n|Retroactive compensation|34,000|\n|Professional services (1FTE) - 6months|45,000|\n|Disc budget (design, campaigns) - 6months|20,000\n|**BIP-738 unnalocated funds**|18,968|\n|**BIP-612 unnalocated funds**|7,034|\n\n## Objectives and Key Results (OKR) Approach\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, the Foundation will:\n\nObjective 1: Maintain essential communications and social media management:\n\n* Onboarding new marketing FTE/contractor.\n* Partners engagement alongside BD team, onboarding chats and necessary meetings\n* Copywriting for social media (X and Medium) and official comms (X and Discord);\n* Engage with freelancers for artwork design in marketing campaigns\n* Community management and moderation.\n* Redirect Baller @danimim (user support, community engagement, mods, newsletter) under new to ad hoc marketing team\n\nObjective 2: Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy:\n\n* Taking from Balancer’s broader strategy and roadmap under development by Ecosystem Council (DAO + BLabs) and establishing clear objectives and KPIs.\n* Propose additional marketing allocation with a comprehensive marketing plan presented to the community, request Treasury funds (as applicable).\n\nObjective 3: Implementation of the marketing plan and transparency:\n\n* Marketing activities will be rolled out across various channels, with ongoing monitoring and optimization.\n* Provide regular updates to the community through regular reports on progress, budget allocation, and key performance indicators.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal represents a significant step forward in the evolution of Balancer's marketing efforts. By shifting to a Foundation-led model, we can leverage professional expertise, ensure strategic alignment, and drive measurable results. We believe this approach will significantly enhance the visibility and adoption of the Balancer protocol, contributing to its long-term success.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, The Balancer Foundation will allocate the resources above to the Balancer OpCo Limited marketing team. No additional transfers from the DAO Treasury are needed, and funds will be allocated from previous savings.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1532\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Beethoven X - Marketing\n\n **Leader(s):** Jedi Rasta, Naly\n\n**Pledge to abide by [[BIP-629]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-629-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards**: Yes \n\n### **Introduction**\n\nBalancer v3 represents the most significant evolution in our platform’s history, showcasing unparalleled innovation in DeFi. To fully realize the potential of this milestone, we propose securing **$60,000 in additional marketing funding**. This funding will enable us to amplify the v3 launch through targeted PR efforts, creative marketing campaigns, and strategic amplification, ensuring the reach and impact necessary to position Balancer as a leader in DeFi.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nThe v3 launch introduces transformative features that redefine DeFi innovation. While our current organic reach is effective for ongoing community engagement, it may not suffice for the market-wide impact required for this pivotal moment. By strategically leveraging marketing resources, we can:\n\n- **Secure Coverage**: Establish Balancer’s presence in top-tier crypto media outlets, podcasts, and newsletters.\n- **Engage Key Stakeholders**: Connect directly with industry thought leaders, influencers, developers, and institutional players.\n- **Expand Reach**: Attract new audiences, including liquidity providers and developers, while strengthening Balancer’s position among DeFi natives.\n\n**The Role of PR**\n\nA strategic PR campaign amplifies internal marketing efforts by leveraging agency expertise and established media relationships. This approach maximizes cost-effectiveness and streamlines outreach, crafting a cohesive narrative that resonates across multiple channels.\n\n**Amplification to Drive Focused Engagement**\n\nAn amplification campaign educates the market, enhances mindshare, and drives adoption by highlighting v3’s unique features in DeFi-native newsletters and outlets. These efforts expand awareness among liquidity providers and DeFi-native users, fueling the user acquisition funnel.\n\n**Creative Marketing for Enhanced Engagement**\n\nInteractive and gamified content will enhance community engagement and highlight the innovative features of v3 in a visually compelling and accessible way. By targeting both DeFi-native and new audiences, creative marketing will complement PR and amplification efforts to maximize the launch’s impact.\n\n### **Funding Breakdown**\n\nTo maximize the impact of the Balancer v3 launch, we have identified the following strategic outreach and creative marketing needs:\n\n**1. Full-Service PR Agency Engagement**\n\n- **Scope**: Comprehensive media management, including press releases, influencer collaborations, and strategic engagements over three months.\n- **Benefits**:\n    - Broad coverage across top-tier crypto publications and podcasts.\n    - Industry expertise to craft tailored messaging and maximize impact.\n    - Resource efficiency, allowing internal teams to focus on core priorities.\n    - Expands Balancer’s mindshare among both crypto natives and non-native audiences.\n- **Estimated Cost**: Up to **$35,000**.\n\n**2. Amplification Campaign**\n\n- **Scope**: Short-term amplification using targeted crypto-focused media outlets (e.g., Chainwire) and grassroots DeFi-native newsletters.\n- **Benefits**:\n    - Rapid dissemination to relevant audiences.\n    - Timely announcements for maximum visibility.\n    - Expands Balancer v3 mindshare among DeFi natives during launch.\n- **Estimated Cost**: **$15,000**.\n\n**3. Creative Marketing Campaign**\n\n- **Scope**: Development of interactive and gamified content to enhance community engagement and showcase v3’s innovative features.\n- **Benefits**:\n    - Engages users through visually compelling and interactive content.\n    - Drives awareness by highlighting v3’s unique benefits in a dynamic and accessible way.\n    - Complements PR and amplification efforts by targeting DeFi-native and new audiences.\n- **Estimated Cost**: **$10,000**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n| **Category** | **Allocation** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **PR Agency Partnership** | Up to $35,000 | Comprehensive media management, press releases, influencer outreach, and strategy. |\n| **Amplification Campaign** | Up to $15,000 | Short-term amplification via Chainwire and DeFi-native newsletters. |\n| **Creative Marketing Campaign** | Up to $10,000 | Development of interactive and engaging content for v3's launch. |\n| **Total Requested Funding** | **$60,000** | Ensures impactful marketing and outreach for the v3 launch. |\n| **Unused Funds** | N/A | Returned to the DAO by the end of Q1 for transparency and accountability. |\n\n### **Execution Plan**\n\n1. **Secure PR Partner**: Engage a full-service PR agency to lead media outreach efforts and manage key campaigns.\n2. **Execute Amplification Campaign**: Deploy amplification strategies using Chainwire and targeted DeFi-native newsletters to enhance v3 launch visibility.\n3. **Execute Creative Marketing Campaign**: Develop and distribute interactive content to highlight v3’s unique features, engaging both existing and new audiences.\n4. **Align Marketing Efforts with v3 Timeline**: Synchronize all activities with the v3 launch schedule to ensure maximum impact.\n5. **Measure and Report**: Post-launch, provide the DAO with a comprehensive report, including outreach results, engagement metrics, and budget utilization.\n\n### Funding and Allocation\n\nThe requested $60,000 will flow through OpCo, which will manage all payments and spending related to the Balancer v3 launch efforts, ensuring efficient use of funds. This funding will cover PR, amplification, and creative marketing initiatives. OpCo’s oversight will ensure that expenditures align with our broader financial planning and support for the Balancer ecosystem. Any unspent funds will be returned to the DAO by the end of Q1, reflecting our commitment to transparency and financial prudence.\n\nThe multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC at 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer, passing 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 as recipient and the amount 60000 as 60000000000.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe launch of Balancer v3 represents an unprecedented opportunity to solidify Balancer’s leadership in DeFi. By securing **$60,000** for targeted PR, amplification, and creative marketing, we can amplify this milestone, engage new and existing audiences, and maximize v3’s impact. This funding supports a clear and strategic path to success, ensuring Balancer remains at the forefront of innovation and engagement in DeFi",

We have also supported core growth strategies and laid the groundwork for the successful launch of Balancer v3 in Q4 this year.\n\nAs we near the completion and release of the v3 codebase to the public, Balancer v3 offers a golden opportunity to redefine our position as a driving force in AMM innovation. Inspired by much of what was expressed in Fernando's recent [vision post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801), we remain highly optimistic about Balancer's future and are fully committed to supporting the ecosystem to the best of our abilities.\n\nAs the current funding period under [BIP-519](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-519-funding-proposal-for-the-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-sp-jan-jun-24/5406) draws to a close, this proposal seeks an extension of funding for the continuation of marketing services from July 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\nThe following sections will discuss some of the key initiatives behind our efforts over the past six months as well as highlight future goals for the next half.\n\n### Key Initiatives & Success Metrics\n\n---\n\n### Education & Content\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\nDriving awareness of Balancer’s core value propositions is the cornerstone of our content creation strategy. As such, we have continued to focus on educational content to enhance the understanding and adoption of Balancer’s core product market fit (PMFs).\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. **Yield Bearing Hub**\n    - With innovations in Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), yield-bearing stablecoins, and Liquid Restaked Tokens (LRTs), Balancer's technology has been crucial in optimizing liquidity for yield-bearing assets. We have focused on developing articles and educational resources to illustrate the benefits of Balancer’s technology in this area.\n\n**Key Content:**\n\nYield Bearing Asset Thesis:\n\nhttps://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-the-yield-bearing-asset-thesis-f44489ba2deb\n\nBalancer showcasing it’s PMF with the Liquid Re-staking Narrative: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749779120450601256\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1759582409526521859\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1760673085131518220\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1768623354532253908\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1780991371966607684\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1788705818814394807\n\nBrought the first Yield Bearing SOL asset to the Ethereum Ecosystem: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785028800797175858\n\nShowcasing innovative solutions for staked stablecoins:\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1786391170194821623\n\n2. **8020**\n\n- The 8020 initiative continues to drive significant value for the Balancer ecosystem. We have continued to develop educational resources to demonstrate the benefits of this model as well as collaborated closely with various projects to co-market and highlight their success stories.\n\n**Key Content:**\n\nve8020 notion pack for partners:\n[The ve8020 Initiative](https://www.notion.so/The-ve8020-Initiative-f13e066945d44d95846d9eb8163180c9?pvs=21) \n\nContinued the ve8020 narrative on X:\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749001706430718356\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749930025384853982\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1767500752740835777\n\n3. **Building on Balancer**\n\n- Balancer distinguishes itself as a platform enabling true AMM experimentation and innovation. We have strived to bring awareness to this by showcasing Balancer’s unique product-market fit (PMF) and highlighting the various AMMs built on Balancer by external teams\n\n**Key content:**\n\nExplaining the cold start problem: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1790455748016668699\n\nShowcasing custom AMM adoption across DeFi: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1798414505325871318\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1801322082698961038\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1784942600925196680\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1796228354850570732\n\nBreaking down new custom pools: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785747336049930252\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785748797340979451\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1793264880226640373\n\n### Partnerships & Strategy\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nBalancer’s long-term success is intrinsically linked to the success of the protocols and products built on our platform. As such we have strived to build stronger relationships with key partners to amplify our ecosystem's reach, enhance Balancer’s product offerings, and drive collaboration.\n\n**Focus:**\nBy closely collaborating with partners to co-develop marketing campaigns, curate educational content, and ideate on community initiatives we have actively strengthened existing foundations and forged new connections within our broader ecosystem.\n\n**Case Studies:**\n\n1. **Gyroscope:**\n    - The integration of Gyroscope’s E-CLP invariant into Balancer’s platform has been a significant milestone. This collaboration has facilitated over $1.1 billion in volume, demonstrating enhanced capital efficiency and validating Gyroscope’s innovative AMM model within Balancer’s ecosystem. Gyroscope has been a testament to the power of Balancer’s infrastructure, setting a solid foundation for other projects to follow.\n    \n    https://x.com/Balancer/status/1795891066626789774\n\n1. **Aura:**\n    - Aura plays a crucial role in the Balancer ecosystem by aggregating and boosting yield for liquidity providers who stake their BPTs. Building a stronger relationship with Aura's marketing team has been a priority over recent months, especially after the disbandment of Orb. Our collaborative marketing efforts with Aura aim to significantly strengthen our users understanding of the broader Balancer x Aura ecosystem, drive community engagement, and showcase the synergistic potential of working together in DeFi.\n    \n    https://blog.aura.finance/what-is-balancer\n2. **CowSwap:**\n    - CowSwap plays a crucial role in the evolution of AMMs by focusing on minimizing MEV and optimizing trade execution. Collaborating with CowSwap is an essential strategy for Balancer, with the potential to propel Balancer to the forefront of AMM innovation with a successful new product. Over the past few months, we have worked closely with the CowSwap team to create educational material regarding LVR (Loss Versus Rebalancing) mitigation strategies for AMMs as well as to develop a Go-To-Market campaign for the upcoming launch of CoW AMM on Balancer.\n    \n    https://x.com/Balancer/status/1793264880226640373\n\n### Design\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\nTo enhance the Balancer brand by creating a cohesive and visually compelling identity that resonates with our target audience, supports our strategic goals, and reinforces Balancer’s position as a leader in DeFi innovation.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. **Brand Development:**\n    - With v3 almost ready for release, we have worked closely with Pon to help evolve the Balancer visual identity for the upcoming  UI release and Z3N rebrand. This collaboration includes the development of a comprehensive brand style guide and asset library to be used across various content verticals, supporting contributors and partners, and ensuring a cohesive and impactful visual presence for Balancer's upcoming initiatives.\n    \n2. **v3 Landing Page:**\n    - As part of the upcoming launch for v3, we have assisted with curating and developing content for the v3 landing page. This effort ensures the page effectively communicates Balancer's core value propositions and embodies Balancer's distinctive style.\n    \n3. **Visual Content Creation:**\n    - Alongside the v3 launch, we have consistently supported marketing-related content with visual imagery. This effort complements the broader marketing strategy and helps to explain content in a more visually engaging way.\n\n \n![image.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicoowhteavye2iknmgmzad3q2nre64dmmi7vrcryj7xbxzmkcxhqy)\n    \n\n\n### v3\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nAs we finalize and prepare to release the v3 codebase, the launch of Balancer v3 presents a prime opportunity to reassert our leadership in AMM innovation. Our primary objective is to present Balancer v3 in the most favorable light, offering thorough education on its key features, executing a comprehensive marketing campaign, and ensuring alignment with business development, design, and strategic partnerships.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. v**3 strategy** \n- Our primary objective has been to ensure that all key elements behind Balancer v3 are aligned for maximum effectiveness. This includes defining [Balancer’s value proposition](https://www.notion.so/bfca24480c4f4470ac70b1d5ebba9fff?pvs=21) for developers building custom AMMs, creating a framework for developer onboarding, and prioritizing critical focus areas. Key initiatives included crafting a compelling landing page with marketing and Pon, developing an informative pitch deck with Lipman, and formulating custom AMM liquidity strategies by Mike B and Tritium. By synchronizing these efforts, we aim to showcase Balancer v3’s unique strengths and drive its successful launch and adoption.\n\n![plan.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicmbobqirvldd5k277huy4btcsgkyp7ksvdyxy5xlnn4pxl6gpwre)\n    \n1. **Go-to-Market (G2M) Strategy:**\n- Our Go-to-Market (G2M) strategy for the v3 launch has been coordinated to build anticipation and ensure a smooth rollout. This includes a phased approach beginning with the release of Fernando's vision article and the codebase reveal, followed by the unveiling of the new UI and Zen rebrand. The strategy will leverage deep dive articles, press releases, partnerships, and teaser campaigns to maximize engagement. We will work closely with key partners like Gyroscope, CowSwap, and Aura to help amplify our efforts. Additionally, our design team is working to ensure all visual elements are cohesive and compelling, further highlighting Balancer v3’s innovative features. This G2M plan aims to effectively showcase Balancer v3's features and foster a successful market entry.\n1. **Content Creation:**\n    - Our content creation strategy for Balancer v3 is focused on developing a series of comprehensive educational materials that will guide users and developers through the new capabilities of v3. This includes a range of articles, tutorials, and explainer videos designed to provide in-depth understanding and practical insights into Balancer v3’s functionalities.  By leveraging a mix of written and visual content, we strive to make the learning process engaging and accessible for all users, with the aim to drive adoption and engagement for Balancer v3.\n    \n2. **Key Partnerships:**\n    - Collaborating with strategic partners is essential to promoting Balancer v3. We are working closely with projects like Aura, CowSwap, and Gyroscope to ensure seamless integration and co-develop promotional strategies that highlight the synergies between our technologies. Looking ahead, we also plan to collaborate on future projects like QuantAMM and host events such as AMAs to showcase the advantages of v3 and its integration with partner technologies.\n\n### Future Goals\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nTo continue driving innovation and growth within the Balancer ecosystem through strategic educational initiatives, creative design projects, strengthened partnerships, in-depth content creation, and live events.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n**1. Balancer University:**\n\nWe aim to establish a comprehensive educational resource designed to guide new users from a basic understanding to an advanced grasp of Balancer technology. Balancer University will cover a range of topics, including beginner's guides to AMMs, the power of 8020s, Boosted Pools, E-CLPs, and a detailed guide on entering the Balancer ecosystem. Additionally, we will develop and deliver tutorials covering various aspects of Balancer, from basic functionalities to advanced custom AMM strategies, ensuring users are well-equipped to navigate and leverage the platform's full potential.\n\n**2. Creative Design Initiatives:**\n\nOur goal is to produce high-quality visuals and infographics that explain complex concepts and highlight the key features of Balancer v3. These visuals will focus on areas such as the AMM design space on Balancer, the broader Balancer ecosystem, hooks, CoW AMM, and comparisons of AMM development on Balancer versus other platforms. \n\n**3. Partnership Focus for v3:**\n\nBuilding and strengthening strategic partnerships is crucial for mutual growth. We plan to forge new relationships and reinforce existing ones with projects like Gyroscope, CowSwap, QuantAMM and Aura. These collaborations will include joint marketing campaigns, co-branded events, and collaborative product development. \n\n**4.

These articles will highlight real-world use cases, success stories, and innovative applications built on Balancer. By providing thought leadership content on the future of DeFi, liquidity provision, and AMM advancements, we aim to position Balancer as a leading voice in the industry.\n\n**5. Community Engagement:**\n\nFostering a vibrant and engaged community is essential for our continued success. We plan to achieve this through interactive initiatives and continuous engagement. We have begun to seed a culture based around the Balancer Buffalos and plan to expand on this foundation in the near future. \n\n**6. Live Events:**\nParticipating in industry conferences and events is a key strategy for showcasing Balancer’s innovations and expanding our reach. These events improve brand visibility, establish thought leadership, and offer unique opportunities for networking and community engagement. For the launch of Balancer v3, attending live events will demonstrate our new features, build strategic partnerships, and deepen community connections through workshops, hackathons, and social meet-ups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n---\n\nAs we approach the completion and release of Balancer v3, we are poised for a transformative period that will redefine our position in AMM innovation. While v3 is on the horizon and will receive significant focus, we remain dedicated to the ongoing development and progression of v2. Our marketing efforts will continue to coordinate closely with the Maxis, BD, and Design teams to ensure comprehensive coverage and support for all initiatives, ensuring Balancer’s continued success across both platforms. \n\n### Length of Engagement & Budget\n\n---\n\nWe are requesting an extension of the current funding outlined in BIP-519, amounting to $30K USDC per month, for marketing-related services from July 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\nThe requested funds will exclusively cover contributor salaries.

Furthermore, we are constantly improving our technology stack with the ultimate goal of achieving self-service autonomy for most operations.\n\nGiven the Maxis are an integral part of Balancer technology and partner management, we aim to switch to bi-annual funding starting in Q4 2024. This provides us with more funding stability and also guarantees that resources for the upcoming Balancer v3 launch will be adequately allocated.\n\n# Initiatives\n\nAs with previous funding proposals, we want to make the most impact to Balancer DAO by working on key initiatives with clearly measurable objectives.\n\nAs context, you can refer to our last quarters performance reports to evaluate our progress in relation to initiatives executed in Q3 2024 ([July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-july-2024/5907), [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-august-2024/5979), reports)\n\n## Initiative 1: Scale Balancer’s On-Chain DevOps Hub\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver the last 6 months, we have taken over responsibility over most of the on-chain operations tech stack, including multi-sig management, OpenZepellin infrastructure to distribute BAL rewards, secondary incentive management as well as new chain deployments and access management.\n\nOur main focus for the next half year is to simplify and further automate any on-chain operations that the DAO has to manage. These include but are not limited to new AMM management (e.g. CoWAMMs), Balancer v3 and its corresponding new fee sweeping mechanism as well as governance operations. Two components will be crucial to drive this initiative forward: our [automation code base](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis) and our [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/).\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Operate and maintain new chain deployments for Balancer v2\n\n* Support custom infrastructure for the Balancer v2 MODE deployment incl. a dedicated MODE ve8020 gauge system on MODE network.\n* Support and integrate potential new chain deployments into our operations infrastructure such as BAL token emission scheduling through OpenZeppelin\n* Deploy and maintain any needed infrastructure to operate those chains\n\n2. Fee processing for Balancer v2\n\n* Coordinate and run fee processing of Balancer v2’s core pool framework as long as it is operational in light of the v3 launch\n* Coordinate with Mimic fee processing\n\n3. Secondary Token reward management\n\n* Build a rewards management system on Mode as part of a veMODE initiative\n* Launch a injector configuration tool on the operations UI to further improve partner management and self-service capabilities\n\n4. AURA position management\n\n* Launch a safe module to automatically relock AURA\n* Maintain the self-service module for vote placement for the BD team and design potential automation work to assign incentives without human intervention.\n\n5. Gauges and Core Pool Framework (Balancer v2)\n\n* Continued management of core pool detection and pool list curation\n* Optimization of fee structure after transitioning our focus from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3\n\n6. Management and Execution of Token Grants\n\n* Maintaining and provisioning of upcoming token distribution grants\n* Advising on how to design and execute token grant programs\n\n7. Omni-chain operations: Chainlink Automation & Gas Stations\n\n* Further optimize Chainlink upkeep monitoring and automate LINK top-ups as well as the design and development of backup systems\n* Incorporate more monitoring solutions into the [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/chainlink-automation)\n* Establish omni-chain gas station contracts to feed all relevant dependencies with ETH (or chain gas tokens) and LINK (gas for automation jobs)\n* Collaborate with Chainlink to define and ship client-side cross-chain rate providers as well as advising on oracles for omni-chain operations.\n\n8. Analytics (v2)\n\n* Transition to maintenance mode for DeFilytica deployments\n\n9. Financial reporting (v2 & v3)\n\n* Advise on financial reporting metrics with karpatkey\n* Build and ship artifacts to monitor revenue generation on Balancer v3\n\n10. Operations UI\n\n* Full GitHub integration to propose changes from the UI\n* Completion of security review with Hypernative\n* Exploration of token whitelisting module\n* Building of tooling surrounding Balancer v2 and v3 management such as monitoring dashboards for Chainlink, Injector v2 configurator or the migration of legacy pool creators for Balancer v2\n\n## Initiative 2: Support and execute on the launch of Balancer v3 and new Products\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus, Tritium\n\n**Team**: Zen Dragon, gosuto, MikeB\n\n**Summary**\n\nBalancer v3 is planned to release between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. The Maxis will play a crucial role in setting up key infrastructure that guarantees correct operations of the new protocol version across chains. We will collaborate with BLabs and other ecosystem partners to plan and execute a smooth launch which will include a rollout to a defined set of target chains and the subsequent management thereafter. Additionally, we will explore new revenue models and tokenomics adjustments that will have the most beneficial impact on both partners and the DAO.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1.

Over the last 6 months we have always been handling the discretionary portion very conservatively. In the last quarter, we only utilized approximately half of the $60k in allocated funds for Q3 2024. We will roll over ***savings from this cost point of more than $25k USDC*** and deduct them from this proposal.\n\nFurthermore, we improved our cost basis per FTE, all while we increased our headcount and capacity for the anticipated higher demand for Balancers v3 launch. Our average costs came down from an average of $13,484 $ / FTE to $13,212.50 $ / FTE (incl. BAL vests) compared to Q3 2024.\n\nA detailed breakdown of our proposed costs is visualized below:\n\n![|624x320](upload://m8DK7A5w9Ai4IkfttRSTMtu56Bs.png)\n\nWe are additionally asking for a BAL token grant of 32,738 BAL for the next half-year (at BAL price of $1.89). BAL will be locked for 1 year either as veBAL or in a veBAL wrapper such as auraBAL.\n\nQuarterly BAL allocation: $30,937.50 ( = 16,369 BAL)\n\nIn total our USDC and BAL cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 5 FTE:\n\n|Position|Cost Basis|\n| --- | --- |\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC + BAL vest)|$13,212.50|\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC)|$11,150|\n|$ / Freelance FTE / month (USDC)|$9,600|\n\n**Length of engagement: 6 months**\n\n**Budget: 398,135 USDC and 32,738 BAL**\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n**Impact on the Treasury**\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold 3,507,473 BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for the next half year would impact 0.93% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 1.87% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 5.727mln in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 6.95% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 13.9%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `398135` USDC as `398135000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `32738` as `32738000000000000000000`.",

Recognized as key contributors and the vital link between partners and the protocol, our dedication to the DAO is unwavering. As we embark on another quarter, our commitment is not just to continue, but to evolve – to redefine our engagement and amplify our positive impact on the DAO in 2024.\n\nThe third quarter marked a significant transition for the Maxis. Following the departure of our strategic visionary, Solarcurve, we embraced change and innovation. Tritium rose to the occasion, leading critical initiatives like the [core pool incentive automation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-457-core-pool-incentive-program-automation/5254), as well as securing and executing on the Arbitrum STIP, demonstrating our adaptability and resilience.\n\nOur evolution goes beyond roles and responsibilities. The Maxis are transforming from a collective of passionate enthusiasts to a team of full-time, professional experts. The new full-time addition consists of @Xeonus who will spearhead our strategic direction.\n\nOur mindful approach to funding allocation ensures an efficient use of resources – balancing USDC and BAL demands with maximum effectiveness. Our focus is not just on growth but on impact and transparency.\n\nIn 2024 we want to make the most impact by driving forward exciting initiatives while providing excellent mission-critical services to the DAO. We have identified four main (non-v3 dependent) initiatives to channel our efforts, while continuing to provide the core services that have been the backbone of the DAO for over two years.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nBeyond regular operations, the Maxi’s are focused on trying to create successful narratives in the Balancer ecosystem through various focused initiatives. In 2024, we strive to focus on a few of them, ensure that our focus areas have a clear leader/champion and some defined goals and that time and resources are available to focus on these topics. The impact of those topics is directly related to the achieved objectives.\n\n### Initiative 1: Growth beyond Mainnet\n\nLead: Tritium\n\nTeam: Shakotan (tech and operations), Xenous (data)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Grants Committee, Beethoven (Marketing + Beets grants)\n\nSummary\n\nThe initiative aims to further strengthen the DAO's presence beyond mainnet, focusing on Arbitrum, zkEVM, and Gnosis. The initiative emphasizes the successful execution of the Arbitrum STIP, but most of all development of strong competencies in creating data-driven narrative showcasing Balancer’s competitiveness, and collaboration with key blockchain partners such as Polygon and Aribtrum. The strategy includes adaptability to pivot based on market trends and performance metrics and an ever growing understanding of the KPIs that our grant providing partners care about.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Timely STIP Execution: Ensure punctual and successful delivery of the current STIP, including consistent reporting and active engagement with the DAO.\n2. Data Narrative Development: Work to build a competency within Balancer to tell stories about how we are using our emissions to drive growth for our protocol and in the ecosystems we exist in.\n\n  1. We should be able to put out velodrome style reports that tell our story.\n\n3. KPI-Focused Program Management: Stay close to various grant programs and look at successful grant recipients to understand the KPIs they set and how they achieve them.\n\n  1.

Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q1 2024 would cost around 0.9% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.3M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.5% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~10%.\n\nFurthermore, this table provides an overview of the last years impact putting this proposal into perspective:\n\n|Year|Quarter|BAL|BAL Price|USDC|ETH|ETH price|Operations cost|People cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|2023|Q1|48000|$6|$0.00|0|1201|0|$266,400|$266,400.00|\n|2023|Q2|42150|$7|$0.00|5|1795|8975|$291,257|$300,231.50|\n|2023|Q3|26025|$5|$132,630.00|20|1853|37060|$251,825|$288,884.50|\n|2023|Q4|31695|$3|$168,770.00|20|1652|33040|$271,779|$304,819|\n|2024|Q1|35718|$4|$108,095.00|20|2170|43400|$250,969|$294,369|\n\nAlthough the Maxis will have around 1 FTE more manpower at their disposal, the impact on the treasury stays nearly the same. Maxis have undergone internal optimizations in pay to reduce the impact on the DAOs USDC as much as possible given the current market conditions. In that regard, 49.5% of requested funding will be locked in our stkauraBAL vesting contract. We will also roll over $37,720.00 in savings from our Q3 and Q4 budget (bizdev, bounties etc.) and deduct that amount from the current proposal, which further reduced our overall demand for USDC.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\nLink to SLA (if going through the Foundation): N/A\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `108095` USDC as `108095000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `35718` as `35718000000000000000000`\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with WETH `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` by writing `deposit` with amount `20` to wrap the required ETH.
