As extra protection, during the initial period of updates (estimated 1-2 months), BGD Labs will join the Risk Council multi-sig in order to add an additional layer of security review. *Chaos Labs will still be the only decision maker for recommendations as defined on their professional scope with the DAO, with us BGD just being a security contributor*.\n- The second is a pilot version to automate interest rate updates of assets (starting with WETH on Aave v3 Lido Ethereum), based on the newly released risk infrastructure technology Edge, by Chaos Labs.\n\nThe repository can be found on [https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards).\n\n---\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe base motivation of Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS) is still the same as the previously proposed version [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204). After a successful initial iteration for cap updates and different GHO parameters using the Stewards pattern, Aave is prepared to generalize the solution and improve its operational efficiency and reactivity to the market.\n\nRegarding the pilot integration of AGRS with Chaos Labs new Edge infrastructure, it has the following rationale:\n\n1. Whenever aligned with other strategic and technical aspects, Aave should benefit from infrastructure built by service providers, in this case, Chaos Labs.\n2. This pilot will be very non-invasive and with only positive outcomes, as the AGRS layer will guarantee that only acceptable interest rate recommendations will reach the Aave protocol, while ideally having a way more dynamic rate.\n\n---\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## 1. AGRS + Risk provider\n\nThe main version of AGRS will follow the specifications described in the previous Risk Stewards post [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204#specification-3), which can be summarised in the following:\n\n- The following risk params could be changed by the RiskStewards:\n    - Supply Caps\n    - Borrow Caps\n    - LTV\n    - Liquidation Threshold\n    - Liquidation Bonus\n    - Debt Ceiling\n    - Base variable borrow rate\n    - Slope 1\n    - Slope 2\n    - Optimal point\n    - CAPO configurations\n- For each configuration type, there will be a minimum delay associated with how frequently the AGRS can be used, named `minDelay`. Ex. after increasing LTV by 5%, the operator of the AGRS (risk provider) must wait a minimum of minDelay before either doing any additional change.\n- Each configuration type will have an associated percentage-based constraint (in basis points), indicating how much the parameter can be changed via AGRS compared to the live value on Aave v3. These constraints (`maxPercentChange`) can be of 2 types:\n    - *Absolute*. E.g. for LTV a 5_00 `maxPercentChange` means that is possible to change the LTV value by +/- 5_00 basis points, or 5%, compared to the current live value. So if the current LTV is 65%, it is possible to change up to 70% or down to 60%.\n    - *Relative*. E.g. for Supply Cap a 50_00 `maxPercentChange` means that is possible to change the Supply Cap value by +/- 50_00 basis points, or 50%, proportional to the current live param. So if the current Supply Cap is 1’000’000 WETH, it is possible to change it up to 1’500’000 WETH, or down to 500’000 WETH.\n- The system allows to restrict assets for AGRS to not apply changes, to be used for example with GHO.\n- The only entity enabled to use the AGRS will be the assigned risk service provider, currently Chaos Labs. As a temporary security precaution, and to avoid introducing a timelock (given that the system should be resilient enough without it), BGD will review the params updates proposed for correctness, but without any influence on the recommendation itself.\n\n\n---\n\n\nTo start with, this component of AGRS will have the following configurations (from recommendations of the risk provider of the community):\n\n| Parameter | Percent change allowed | minimumDelay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply and Borrow Caps | 100% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| Debt Ceiling | 20% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| CAPO dynamic cap | 5% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| CAPO stable cap | 0.5% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Slope 1 | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Slope 2 | 5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Optimal Point (Kink) | 3% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Loan to Value (LTV) | 0.25% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 0.25% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n\n\nThe principles for them in the initial phase are:\n- Still highly constraint in percentages and time, in order to not deposit too much trust to start with.\n- Similar as with caps updates, all usage of stewards will be previously disclosed on the Aave governance forum, by a framework to be defined by Chaos Labs, the risk provider in charge.\n\n\nAdditionally, the only blacklisted asset will be GHO on Ethereum, given that changes on it are usually done by the ALC (Aave Liquidity Committee) via the GHOSteward, or directly with governance proposals.\n\n---\n\n## 2. AGRS + Edge Infrastructure by Chaos Labs\n\nDays ago, the Aave risk service provider Chaos Labs [announced Edge](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/introducing-edge-the-next-generation-oracle),  a new product innovating on the risk infrastructure ecosystem.\n\nThis new system directly addresses a challenge for risk recommendations on Aave: how to connect as seamlessly as possible the platform of parameters recommendation run by Chaos during the last years for Aave, with the Aave protocol.\n\nWith this activation of AGRS pending, after evaluating the solution, and due to the already long contribution history of Chaos Labs, we decided that is a good opportunity to test out the usage of Edge for a specific parameter: Aave rates configurations for WETH on v3 Lido Ethereum.\n\nThis model will use another instance of AGRS (exactly the same codebase as the other model), but with the following constraints:\n\n- The AGRS + Edge instance will only have configurable rate-related parameters: base variable borrow rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2.\n- Recommendations of these parameters will be submitted to a risk oracle smart contract, from the Edge off-chain infrastructure.\n- Between the risk oracle smart contract and the AGRS contract, there will be a very thin middleware `AaveStewardsInjector` , which will have the following logic:\n    - Will take recommendations from the Edge Risk Oracle side and propagate them to the AGRS contract.\n    - Enforce that only the WETH asset can be acted upon.\n    - Given the protections (percentage constraints and time delay) on the AGRS side and that it is an assumption that risk recommendation will be the time correct on the Edge Risk Oracle, the propagation will be permissionless.\n\n\nRegarding the configurations of the AGRS + Edge instance, will be the following (for only WETH on v3 Lido Ethereum to start with):\n\n| Parameter | Percent change allowed | minimumDelay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate | 0.5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Slope 1 | 0.5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Slope 2 | 5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Optimal Point (Kink) | 3% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n\n\n## Security\n\nIn addition to our internal review and testing procedures, the AGRS have been reviewed by Certora, and the report can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards?tab=readme-ov-file#security)",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nAs continuation of the engagement finished 1st October, present to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development and security coordinator services.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nTime flies in DeFi, and it has already been two and a half years since BGD started working for the Aave DAO.\nDuring this time, the market has gone up and down, new protocols have appeared, and CEXes have fallen. But the Aave protocol remains, and, following almost any metric, it has grown.\n\nTogether with the work of other service providers, we want to believe our contribution has had an important role in both the stability of Aave (creating solid trust) and the growth itself, with tech enabling all new types of use cases while maintaining the highest standards of security.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nDuring the last 3 engagements between BGD Labs and the Aave DAO, all pieces of the Aave infrastructure have been worked on: the Aave protocol itself with new versions and maintaining the current ones, the Aave governance, bridging infrastructure, all rails for expansion to new networks and use cases, supporting non-technical contributors to maximise their value without being blocked by tech; basically everything.\n\nThe motivation/goal of this new engagement is:\n\n- Keep the stability and trust in the Aave technology.\n- Innovate responsibly on production systems.\n- Support all other non-tech contributors to the DAO, accelerating progress.\n\nIn summary, the same as before, but always striving for better.\n\n\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## Aave <> BGD Phase IV (continuous) scope\n\nThe scope of this Phase IV builds upon all previous phases, and as commented, is focused on continuous maintenance and development of the Aave ecosystem technical infrastructure, in combination with security coordination and support to other contributors.\n\nMore specifically, the services include the following:\n\n- **Propose improvements on top of the current Aave v3.2 production version**. This will include minimum a v3.3 and v3.4 versions, but with quite certainty, more.\n    \n    Additionally, we have several other ideas to improve the core protocol, which will be unveiled to the community as soon as the feasibility research is positive.\n    \n- **BGD will take back the scope of deploying to new networks and pool instances**. As commented on our Phase 3 final recap, we identified that having different entities on the deployment stage of Aave v3 creates more overhead than benefit. So we think for Phase IV it is more optimal to get the following entities involved in the activation procedures:\n    - BGD Labs will perform all the pre-governance proposal stages (deployment of required smart contracts, adaptation of all tooling, and development of the activation proposal itself).\n    - As it currently happens, Certora will review the on-chain governance proposal once submitted, in order to have redundancy.\n- **Maintain Aave Governance v3 and a.DI**. In this phase, the effort will be on improving the user interface owned by the Aave DAO, and on the a.DI side, increasing even more the visibility on the infrastructure (on https://adi.onaave.com/), streamlining upgrade procedures via governance proposals, and on-demand, enabling new paths and bridge providers.\n    \n    Additionally, with the rollups ecosystem evolving (e.g. ZK-based), we will once again evaluate the expansion of voting to other networks, an item we removed priority on the previous engagement as the return of resources investment was not there.\n    \n- **Aave bug bounty program**. After already close to 1 year of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty being active, we plan to make certain improvements to it. Same time, we will remain as reviewers, addressing all the submissions and the different stages until bounty payment.\n- **v2 further off-boarding**. At the beginning of the previous Phase 3, Aave v2 pools were still very meaningful instances of the protocol, both in size and usage. Currently, different off-boarding initiatives (both from us and other contributors) have reduced a lot the role of v2 in the ecosystem versus v3. During this engagement, we will proceed/support further proposals for off-boarding of v2, with the target being reaching a scenario where only very major assets stay (e.g. WETH, stETH, USDC, USDT), but everything else naturally gets finally migrated to v3.\n- **Focus on Aave Stewards and additional infrastructure delegation**. We believe the path of using what we name the Stewards pattern is most probably the future direction of Aave:\n    - The Aave Protocol (v3) is the base layer of smart contracts, enforcing the highest-order validations and general settlement logic. Decentralized, with only the Aave Governance having “super-admin” control.\n    - The protocol delegates operational/management functions to other smart contracts, the Stewards. These are highly constrained on-chain agents, that allow for faster and more optimal operations, but that can lose this power at any point if the Aave Governance decides so, and with low capacity to create any damage on the protocol.\n    - Currently, the Stewards are focused mainly on optimizing risk parameter updates, but we envision extending this pattern to multiple areas, for example, finance (a Finance Steward is in the advance stage by the treasury contributors).\n    \n    Our role in Stewards development will involve 1) defining an approach that is scalable enough for the current and future needs of the DAO 2) developing the core Steward contracts we believe require our involvement 3) if optimal, supporting other contributors to create their own Stewards, or modifying existing ones for the needs of the DAO.\n    \n- **Umbrella support post-release**. In Phase 3, we included a separate scope for the creation from scratch of Umbrella, a new version of the current Aave Safety Module. Scheduled to be released pretty soon, the project will require post-release support, mainly in the shape of:\n    - Supporting non-BGD contributors involved in all Umbrella operations, for example, regulation of incentives, and risk considerations like choosing correct targets.\n    - Improvements post-release.\n    - Iterating on tooling after the initial effort included with the previous Umbrella scope.\n- **Aave protocol security coordinator**. Same as in our previous engagement, this involves:\n    - Continuously evaluate technical risks for Aave.\n    - Address events involving any vulnerability affecting Aave. This includes also creating governance proposals if required.\n    - Act as technical support for the Aave Protocol and Governance Guardians: define and document plans of action, communicate with both of them whenever a reaction is needed, and also properly disclose to the community activity on Guardian.\n- **Aave proposals reviews**. We will review all governance proposals before they go on-chain, the same as we have been doing last year. This acts as the first layer of security and quality, minimizing any potential issue to be detected on the on-chain stage by Certora, on their line of contribution.\n- **Maintenance and improvement of all tooling of the Aave ecosystem**. During the previous phases, we created multiple tools and projects on the off-chain side of Aave, like Aave Address Book, the Aave Proposals repository, Aave Helpers, the Aave Config Engine and a myriad of others. During this new Phase, we will keep improving them and creating anything new needed.\n- **Analysis for candidate networks to activate Aave v3**. Even if the plan on the previous scope was to off-board network analysis, finally we decided to keep performing them ourselves, as the overhead of supporting another entity would not have been good resource allocation.\n    \n    In this new scope, we will continue performing this analysis.\n    \n\n\n---\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phases II & III, 6 months: starting from the moment the previous engagement ended (1st October 2024) and lasting until 1st April 2025.\n\n**BUDGET**: 2’300’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 50% paid up-front and 50% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n---\n\n\n## What is NOT part of both the scopes\n\nSimilar as on Phase 3, we want to be explicit on what is not included in our line of contribution:\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora. On our side, we only do a best-effort review if we deem it appropriate.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor. Given our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so. Any tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n- Very ad-hoc projects will depend on the pipeline of priority, and potentially will be budgeted/estimated independently, if we see they will have important implications on the scope that we need to fulfil and/or not fitting in this initial estimation. For example, any projects like Umbrella will be budgeted apart, and we don’t disclose them at the moment, due to being in feasibility research phase.\n\n\n# Terms of Service\n\nA formal Terms and Conditions document for the engagement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs can be found [HERE](https://bgdlabs.com/aave-dao-tos).\n\n\nWe would like however to highlight again the same high-level points as on Phase 3, which we thing are very important for the ethos of the DAO:\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the core software (e.g. all on-chain smart contracts to be used by the DAO in production) we create during our engagement are licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to new Aave v3 version, Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication:\n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if already doing it by commercialising all the different Aave products, we believe in the near future IP and licensing commercialisation is something the DAO should put focus on, at the same time common good infrastructure is released.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n- **We don’t work with competitors of the Aave DAO**. To do the type of work we do on Aave, the community should trust us as service provider. To avoid any type of conflict, we compromise to not work with any competitor of the Aave DAO for any type of financial gain.\n\n\n# Disclosures\n\nBGD Labs has no meaningful commercial relation with entities that could create any type conflict of interest on the scopes of this proposal.\nSimilar as during the previous years, the majority of our focus is on core development and security services on Aave (exclusive provider): we have absolutely no engagement with any entity that could be perceived as competitor of the Aave DAO and we will not during the duration of this Phase 4.\n\n\n# Next steps\n\nIf the outcome of this pre-approval Snapshot ARFC is positive, we will proceed with the final AIP on-chain proposal, which will act as binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs",

        "body": "# Summary\nPresent to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development services, after Phase 1 and 2.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 1. Motivation. Aave and BGD 1, 2….3\n\nMay 9th 2022, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 1, a proposal for services to the DAO, covering a pretty extensive scope on the big majority of Aave sub-systems; development and security related.\n\nDuring the following 15 months, we [did or participated in dozens of projects](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-working-day-365/13033)  of technical nature for the Aave DAO, and more importantly, we set precedent that a model of a fully independent company providing services to a decentralised entity can work.\n\nSeptember 4th 2023, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 2, with similar type of scope as Phase 1, but with slightly different objectives in mind: the technical foundation of the Aave DAO was pretty solid from Phase 1, and possible to iterate on top of it, with a more concrete scope.\nAdditionally, we set ourselves as a goal to study how to introduce extra technical parties to service specific needs of the DAO, helping more on the decentralisation of the organisation, but without disturbing operations and delivery.\n\nAlso, we proposed a way shorter engagement (6 months), which we thought was more optimal for the DAO to have capacity to manoeuvre. The outcome of this work can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bored-ghosts-phase-2-recap/16791).\n\n\n\nWe think that our services to the DAO on both Phases had played a role on Aave staying in top of its category for years in so nascent field, and the Aave codebase being used in other products, accounting to close to 75% of total market share category.\n\nNow we present Phase 3, continuist, but with some important changes in terms of scope.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 2. Specification. Aave <> BGD Phase III. The scope\n\nThis time, we want to explicit divide our proposal in 2 different and explicit components, each one with its separate scope, budget and duration characteristics.\n\n## Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO\n\nThis scope is the continuist component historically performed by BGD for the DAO, and will be composed of the following items:\n\n- Maintain, improve and consolidate all the Aave tooling introduced in Phases I & II, including but not limited to Aave Address Book, Aave Helpers, Aave Proposals, Risk Stewards, Seatbelt and Killswitch.\n- Maintain and improve Aave Governance v3, a.DI and Aave Robot, together with the tooling surrounding them.\n    \n    The following new items will be delivered, consequence of the research done on Phase 2:\n    \n    - Extend coverage of voting networks to rollups, apart from the current Polygon PoS and Avalanche C-Chain.\n    - Allow voting with AAVE tokens held in non-Ethereum networks.\n    - Granular and generalised consensus rules for a.DI, together with different planned optimisations.\n- Propose further improvements on top of the upcoming Aave 3.1.\n- Different v3 maintenance tasks with important development requirements, including:\n    - Improve asset off-boarding procedures.\n    - Complete removal of stable debt logic.\n- Act as reviewers of Aave <> Immunefi for all current Aave ecosystem, not including GHO (Avara currently being the reviewer). Additionally, doing proper maintenance of the bug bounty program.\n- Act as security coordinator of the Aave ecosystem, including:\n    - Continuously evaluate potential technical risks for Aave.\n    - Design specific protection strategies in the event of any vulnerability affecting Aave.\n    - If arising, create governance proposals to mitigate any type of problem affecting Aave.\n    - Coordinate with the Aave Guardian for protective emergency actions.\n- Support with further technical off-boarding strategies for legacy versions of Aave (v1, v2) in a safe manner, both for the DAO and the users of the protocol.\n- Advise other contributors on which security procedures to apply for their developments, when required.\n- Evaluate new upcoming high-level technical implications/risks for the protocol, for example, new types of assets being listed.\n- Generally advise other contributors, whenever feedback from an entity expert on the Aave protocol is required. This includes but is not limited to contributors on the risk, treasury, security reviews and miscellaneous fields.\n- Review governance proposals on pre-onchain stage, not as a full security audit, but in order to verify that we don’t see any integration problem with Aave’s smart contracts and good practises.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO*\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phase 2, 6 months, starting from proposal execution.\n\n**BUDGET**: as some items are not included in the scope (more later), the budget has been reduced from Phase 2. 1’600’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 60% paid up-front and 40% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n\n## What is NOT part of the scope\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor.\nGiven our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so.\nAny tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Scope 2: Aave Safety Module - Code A\n\nAs commented before, we believe now the Aave DAO is in a really solid stage of their current systems, quite future-proof and ready to scale:\n\n- Aave v3 is a solid liquidity layer, on which is possible to iterate and improve.\n- Aave Governance v3 is probably the most advanced on-chain governance system in production.\n- a.DI is a totally generic bridging layer, that can be used for any cross-chain communication need on the Aave ecosystem, in a secure and scalable manner.\n- Aave Robot is a solid automation layer, integrated with Chainlink Automation, but flexible enough for any technology.\n\nMore in the line of innovative projects like Aave Governance v3, we propose to create a completely new system in an Aave component which requires improvement: the Aave Safety Module.\n\n\n### Aave Safety Module: Code A\n\nSafety Module Code A is the major project on the innovation side of this scope, but different to previous cases, our proposed approach is different: at the moment, we will not disclose a detailed description of it, as we think this is the right strategic approach for the DAO.\n\nHowever, we can say the following about Code A:\n\n- It will change completely the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE and stkABPT.\n- More efficient mechanism than the current.\n- Improved use experience.\n- Heavily improved dynamics for builders to build on top, but still batteries included.\n- Affecting importantly AAVE tokenomics.\n- Holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO.\n- Directly/indirectly benefiting any future project of the DAO.\n\nWe are aware this requires some trust by the community on our research and execution capabilities (which is reflected on the payment schedule), but considering that the main beneficiary will be explicitly the DAO and our history of services, we think it is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 2. Safety Module Code A*\n\n**DURATION**: this scope is not continuous like Scope 1, but our estimation is similar for full completion, approximately during the next 6 months to have everything fully ready and in production.\nHowever, delivery and communications will definitely be iterative, with extensive details of Project A to be disclosed in the first 2 months, and highly probably some of its components.\n\n**BUDGET**: 1’900’000 in stablecoins and 7’500 AAVE, with the following schedule:\n\n- 40% upfront.\n- 60% in a delayed payment in 4-months from now, when we estimate to be in good stage of completion.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Terms of Service\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the major software we have produced during our engagement have been licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication: \n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if other models can be explorer, from our point of view, this is a pretty solid contribution model for the innovation side of the DAO.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Next steps\n\nIf this ARFC Snapshot is positive, we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal that will serve as formal and binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs, on the terms defined.",

        "body": "# Summary\nProposal to pre-approve the activation of Aave v3.2 across all Aave pool instances, a new version of v3 (currently v.3.1) including two important changes:\n\n- A new feature: Liquid eModes.\n- The removal of all deprecated stable rate logic.\n\n\n# Context\nJuly 27th, Aave governance proposal 132 3 activated Aave v3.1 across all active networks. This currently active version of the Aave protocol was focused on security improvements (e.g. introducing virtual accounting), changing the architecture of the interest rate strategies, and multiple other updates to improve the operational efficiency of the system.\n\nAdditionally, with Aave v3.1 we introduced Aave v3 Origin 4, a new repository for the Aave protocol (Foundry-based) to serve as the cornerstone to release further post-v3.1 versions faster while keeping maximum security standards.\n\nOne and a half months later, as a result of previous groundwork with v3.1 and Origin, we are glad to present to the community this new Aave v3.2 version.\n\n## Aave v3.2\nThe changes included in Aave v3.2 are more isolated than those of v3.1, and of different nature. While removing stable rate-related logic is more on the maintenance/codebase cleanup side, liquid eModes is a total user-facing and powerful feature.\n\n### 1 -  Liquid eModes\n\nAave v3 introduced the concept of eMode (efficiency mode), an abstraction within the pool for configuring groups of assets with more capital-efficient risk configurations (LTV, Liquidation Threshold). This unlocked use cases like native high-leverage or even strategies between stablecoins. eMode could be deemed one of the first experiments in DeFi at scale with the concept of pools of assets within pools of assets.\n\nThe eMode feature has seen since then tremendous success, enabling use cases like ETH-correlated eMode, allowing for higher than default risk parameters on ETH LSTs/ETH positions (or MATIC, AVAX with their LSTs). However, the eMode feature always had some room for improvement, that way truly unlocking even more powerful use cases and flexibility on Aave.\n\nA known technical limitation of the initial iteration of eMode is the following: a single eMode is optionally assigned to assets listed on Aave. That means that if let’s say WETH is assigned eMode 1 eligibility (ETH-correlated, with ETH LSTs), WETH can’t be eligible for any other eMode.\n\nIn different scenarios, this is an important constraint, as currently is not possible to have on the same Aave pool an eMode with wstETH and WETH, together with a different eMode with weETH and WETH, as WETH can only be in one of them at the same time.\n\n\n\nThe new Liquid eMode feature of Aave v3.2 removes the previous constraint: an asset listed on Aave can be eligible for different eModes, and then it only depends on the user to choose which eMode he wants to enter to.\n\nFor example, with liquid eModes, a possible configuration not doable before would be:\n\n- eMode 1, with wstETH, weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 2, with wstETH and WETH.\n- eMode 3, with weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 4, with WETH and GHO.\n\nSo then, user A holding the wstETH and weETH collaterals, could borrow WETH at high LTV. User B holding only wstETH could borrow WETH at high (but different) LTV. User C holding only weETH could similarly borrow WETH at a different LTV than the previous two eModes. User D could have a position with WETH collateral and GHO borrowings.\n\nThis doesn’t stop there, as more sophisticated configuration strategies could be adopted, like:\n\n- eMode for only WETH and stablecoins.\n- eMode for onboarding less mature LSTs, without requiring them being together with all major LSTs.\n\nFor extra configuration flexibility, liquid eModes also allow now to flag an asset as only borrowable, only collateral, or both, in the context of an eMode. For example, in a hypothetic eMode with only wstETH and WETH, the normal configuration would be wstETH as only collateral and WETH as only borrowable, fully focusing on the wstETH leverage use-case.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the previous main characteristics of liquid eModes, we have also introduced the following minor changes to the system:\n\n- Now the protocol doesn’t enforce the LTV/LT of an asset being lower outside its eligible eModes. However, the validation gets stricter on the user side when entering any eMode (or from no-eMode): Health Factor is always validated to never allow the user to get his position below 1HF post-eMode swap.\n- The protocol previously had an eMode-specific price feed, to be used to price with the same feed all assets on an eMode. However, this has never been used, and its utility (in its current form) is quite arguable. Therefore, we have to remove it from the data structure to allow more efficient storage allocation.\n- On a technical note, before 3.2, the eMode of an asset was stored on the asset’s data itself. Now, the eMode data stores all the necessary information for the protocol to understand which assets are eligible on that eMode.\n- Similar as with previous upgrades on Aave v3, we have tried to follow a non-invasive approach when adding the feature, only touching/refactoring those pieces that were clearly necessary, but without doing any big high-level refactoring of the pool.\n\n### 2 - Stable rate logic cleanup\n\nPart of the v.3.1 upgrade was the addition of a function swapToVariable() for anybody to permissionless off-board stable borrowings to variable, that way factually deprecating completely stable rate on Aave pools.\n\nWith currently no active stable rate position (moved via the Dolce Vita program by the service provider ACI 4), we have executed a follow-up step on the process: completely removing the stable rate logic from the protocol, which one hand simplifies the codebase, but on the other hand it also slightly optimises gas consumption and logic flows.\n\nEven if fairly extensive change, this cleanup is non-invasive in how the protocol operates given that there are no active stable rate positions. All technical details about it will be included in the upcoming v3.2 release technical changelog.\n\n## Security\nIn addition to all standard internal procedures on BGD Labs (testing, review), the external security processes are getting finished. Before the final AIP, they will be properly communicated in the Aave governance forum.\n\nSimilar as with any other Aave v3 upgrades, the AIP proposal will include compensation for the cost of the external security procedures.",

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5.
