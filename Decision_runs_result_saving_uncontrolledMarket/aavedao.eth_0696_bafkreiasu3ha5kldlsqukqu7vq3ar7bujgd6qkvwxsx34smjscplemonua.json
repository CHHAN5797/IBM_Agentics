        "body": "Current parameters:\nSupply cap: `500k sAVAX` → `1m sAVAX` (proposed increase of supply cap)\nBorrow cap: 0 sAVAX\nDEX Liquidity: ~$40m\n\nNormal mode:\nLTV: 20%\nLiquidation threshold: 30%\nLiquidation penalty: 10%\n\nE-mode:\nAsset: AVAX\nMax LTV: 92.5%\n\n**Proposal: Increase of supply cap by 100% to 1m sAVAX (~$23m)**\n\nThe current sAVAX supply cap on v3 is 500k sAVAX (~ $11.5m) and has been reached within two weeks of listing.\nDue to the efficacy of E-mode, where sAVAX can only be used as collateral to borrow AVAX, protocols built on top of aAVAsAVAX (AAVE Avalanche sAVAX) have seen extensive growth with deposits at max supply cap.\nThe proposal’s goal is to suggest an increase of 100% to 1m sAVAX supply cap via the fast-track process as outlined here (https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-supply-borrow-cap-management-fast-track-process/8045).\n\nReasons for increase:\n\n**DEX Liquidity and Conversion Rate**: Despite market conditions, DEX liquidity has remained around $40m across Platypus, TraderJoe and Pangolin. This can facilitate healthy liquidations if ever necessary. However, at the time of writing, there has not been any necessary liquidations of sAVAX on AAVE.\n\nAs Liquid Staked AVAX, there exists a pseudo peg to AVAX on secondary markets such as Platypus. Due to the nature of the asset, the conversion rate of sAVAX:AVAX has been quite closely maintained due to natural price arbitrage and a 15-days redemption window.\n\n**LTV and E-mode**: sAVAX has a modest LTV on normal mode, at 20%, where there exists a healthy spread of price deviation to facilitate liquidations if necessary. On E-mode, only AVAX can be borrowed against sAVAX, which is a highly correlated asset with healthy liquidity on DEXs.\n\n**Maturing Asset**: The cap was initially set as it was a deployment of a new pool. sAVAX has been listed for more than 2 weeks (listed 30th June 2022) and has been near supply cap since. As an asset, sAVAX is relatively mature, having launched in February 2022 and having undergone tumultuous market conditions and stress testing.\n\nAt its peak, there were over 4.27m AVAX staked within the BENQI protocol, with users claiming over 2.05m AVAX (> 46%) from the protocol on multiple occasions within days as documented by DefiLlama (https://defillama.com/protocol/benqi-staked-avax?denomination=AVAX).\n\nVote:\nYes - **Accept** the increase of sAVAX limit to 1m sAVAX\nNo - **Reject** the increase of sAVAX limit to 1m sAVAX\nAbstain - Decline to vote",

        "title": "ARC: Enable sUSD as Collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism with a 10 million sUSD Supply cap",
        "author": "0x46abFE1C972fCa43766d6aD70E1c1Df72F4Bb4d1",
        "body": "**Summary** :\n\nsUSD is a decentralized stable coin over collateralized by the SNX token. sUSD is already listed on AAVE markets as a lendable asset as well as SNX which can be used as collateral in addition to borrow/lending. There is significant liquidity for sUSD on both Mainnet and Optimism. I am proposing for it to be enabled as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism with a 10 million sUSD supply cap.\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n- set sUSD max LTV to 60%\n- set liquidation threshold to 75%\n- set liquidation penalty to 5%\n- upgrade the interest rate curve to that of DAI/TUSD\n- Fixed lending is not enabled.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nsUSD market cap has grown tremendously over the past year, and the steady demand for decentralized stable coins has contributed to its growth. sUSD is highly over collateralized by SNX, the governance token, and backstop for the Synthetix protocol.\n\nThe rise in its liquidity on major dexes has contributed to sUSD stability over the past year, and allowing collateral use would promote its liquidity in aave markets.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nSNX stakers are incentivized to actively manage their debt relative to their SNX stake and sometimes cause spikes in demand for sUSD on markets including AAVE (especially when there are other Yield generating opportunities with sUSD), this may cause small deviations from the peg but with low volatility.\n\nFrom a counter-party risk perspective, all underlying functions in relation to sUSD are fundamentally the same as that of SNX.\n\nThe SNX and sUSD contracts are fully upgradeable. Still, all changes must go through a formal governance process from SIP to deployment, which would be announced well before the upgrades are made and thus does not present a substantial counter-party risk.\n\nThe sUSDv2CRV pool has deep liquidity on L1, and with incentivizes, the L2 pool will soon have deep liquidity. \n\nIn addition to sUSD, there are other synth pools on Curve with emission gauges to supplement sUSD liquidity (sBTC, sETH ). All synths are redeemable at their dollar value in sUSD at the ChainLink quoted price through the Synthetix protocol or Curve (via cross-asset swaps); thus they help facilitate the arbitrage sUSD peg deviations.\n\nreferences:\n\nsUSD/3crv curve pool - TVL $101M/27M sUSD\n\nsBTC curve pool- TVL $198M / $66M sBTC\n\nsETH curve pool- TVL $86M / $39M sETH\n\n**Technical Specifications sUSD**\n\nChainlink sUSD price feed: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/docs/optimism-price-feeds/)\n\n\n",
