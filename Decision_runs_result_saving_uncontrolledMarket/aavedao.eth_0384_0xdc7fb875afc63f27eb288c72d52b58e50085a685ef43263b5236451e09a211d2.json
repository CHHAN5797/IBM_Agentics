The 100 aEthWETH is to remain to support on going DAO funding. \n\nThe table below shows the yield differential between the various assets:\n\n|Asset|Yield (%)| \n| --- | --- | \n|wETH| 0.00|\n|awETH|1.26|\n|aEthWETH|1.97 |\n|rETH|3.07|\n\nBased upon current market conditions, the additional yield generated by converting the assets as outlined to rETH is $23,266.50. \n\nUpon implementation of this [ARFC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-aave-v3-eth-pool-weth-parameters/15110), the additional yield generated is ~$654.42, for the conservative and ~$2,782.86, for the aggressive approach due to the reduction in deposit rates of approximately 10.3 bps and 33.5bps respectively. This does not take into consideration how the market will then adjust after the ETH v3 interst rate parameters are changed. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following is to be performed:\n\n* Deposit all wETH into aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH)\n* Withdraw all awETH (Aave V2 wETH) into ETH\n* Withdraw all but 100 aEthWETH (Aave V3 wETH) into ETH\n* Deposit ETH into RocketPool's rETH\n* Transfer rETH into collector\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Supporting ETHx on Aave V3 continues our advocacy for LST diversity, complementing existing assets like stETH, cbETH and rETH.\n\n# Specification\n\nContract Address: ETHx - [0xA35b1B31Ce002FBF2058D22F30f95D405200A15b](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA35b1B31Ce002FBF2058D22F30f95D405200A15b)\n\nAfter review of initial Risk Parameters by Risk Managers (Gauntlet & Chaos Labs) there are currently two possibilities: to apply Conservative Risk Parameters or to apply Aggressive Risk Parameters.\n\nConservative Risk Parameters Option:\n \n![Captura de pantalla 2023-12-06 a las 20.04.33.png](ipfs://bafkreidqhtw5gyy7rjhw3mm2re7biyw2do72bzzsyf3eohhzd65akwo4zu)\n    \n\nAggressive Risk Parameters Option:\n \n![Captura de pantalla 2023-12-06 a las 20.03.40.png](ipfs://bafkreihf7ncuqhms5c67x2mhyspcdkahvjlzp7jmlha2ezqor7kyogvdai)\n    \n    \n# Next Steps\n\n1. Solicit feedback from the Aave community.\n2. If community sentiment is favorable, proceed with the ARFC snapshot.\n3. Success in the snapshot leads to the development of an AIP.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Stader and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Users have reported two type of losses: \n * losses resulting from liquidation\n * losses resulting from high interest rates and accruing interests\n\nAs  [stated](https://docs.aave.com/aavenomics/safety-module#shortfall-events) in the definition of a shortfall event:\n\n*The main role of the Safety Module is to protect the protocol against **unexpected loss** of funds stemming from:*\n\n* **Smart contract risk** : *Risk of a bug, design flaw or potential attack surfaces on the smart contract layer.*\n* [...]\n\nGiven that the losses reported by the users are:\n * resulting from an undisclosed smart contract risk leading to the freezing/pause action\n * unexpected, given the unexpected nature of the freeze/pause action\n\nIt seems conclusive to me that the incident satisfies the definition of a shortfall event.\n\n # Specification\n\nThis TEMP CHECK does not require any on-chain action or protocol changes.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n**No Guarantee of Results; and Limitation of Liability:**\n\nThis proposal is neutrally presented based on current community sentiment.

This would be achieved by integrating sDAI, an ERC-4626 Vault token that includes the DSR yield, into the Aave protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DSR is a variable rate set by MakerDAO governance that allows DAI holders to earn savings by locking their DAI into the DSR contract. Recently, MakerDAO governance plans to increase the DSR rate to 3.49%. By integrating the DSR into Aave via sDAI, we can allow Aave liquidity providers to benefit from the DSR rate without additional cost to the Aave DAI borrowers.\n\n## Specification\n\nAt the protocol level, when a user deposits DAI, the protocol will wrap their DAI in the form of sDAI and deliver aDAI to the user. When a user borrows DAI, the protocol will unwrap the stored sDAI, deliver DAI, and accrue the debt amount in DAI.\n\n![image|1920x1563, 40%](upload://fQNJl46MrGPtwEuH6Trg6zzyqNP.jpeg)\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis integration will have the consequence of increasing the gas cost of using DAI in Aave for every user. The exact impact of these gas cost increases should be reviewed and considered by the community during the ARFC stage of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK receives positive feedback and a Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, the next step would be to draft an ARFC\ndetailing the technical implementation of this integration.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not paid by makerDAO or any third party to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

EURC is Circle’s EUR backed stablecoin.\n\nMotivation\n-\nCircle is an established stablecoin issuer mainly known for USDC. EURC is their EUR based stablecoin and we believe it will be a great addition as it enables stablecoin diversity. EURC has also shown significant adoption and usage on Avalanche network with over $2M of liquidity on TraderJoe pool.\nBy onboarding EURC, we believe that the DeFi synergies created for users depositing or borrowing EURC on Aave will be a net positive for Aave and the Avalanche ecosystem.\n\nSpecification\n-\nProject: https://www.circle.com/en/\nDocumentation: https://www.circle.com/en/eurc\nAvalanche Contract: 0xC891EB4cbdEFf6e073e859e987815Ed1505c2ACD\nChainlink oracle: EACAggregatorProxy | Address 0x3368310bC4AeE5D96486A73bae8E6b49FcDE62D3 | SnowTrace 2\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n\nRisk parameters can be defined by ChaosLabs and Gauntlet at the ARFC stage after TEMP CHECK reaches consensus.\n\n\nDisclaimer\n-\nKeyrock is not presenting this Temp Check on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this Temp Check. Keyrock holds EURC inventory as part of our liquidity provisioning operations.\n\nNext Steps\n-\n1. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n2. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage using the Skyward program from the ACI (@MarcZeller).\n\nCopyright\n-\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

    "decision_stance": "Not change, Status quo",
    "ai_final_conclusion": "Option 'NAY' selected with stance to keep 'Not change, Status quo'.",
    "ai_final_reason": "• The proposal aimed to address bad debt removal from the Harmony Horizon Bridge hack by creating a fund and exchange mechanism but was met with strong community skepticism and rejection.\n• Forum discussions revealed concerns about fairness, unclear funding sources, and preference for alternative recovery methods such as liquidation or burning assets.\n• Historical similar proposals passed but resulted in negative market impacts, highlighting risks of approving recovery-style interventions.\n• Timeline analytics showed early strong support for 'YAE' but final voting overwhelmingly favored 'NAY', reflecting a community shift to oppose the proposal.\n• Forum sentiment analysis showed mixed but largely negative or neutral sentiment overall, aligning with the rejection vote.\n• Therefore, the recommendation is to maintain the status quo and not change, reflecting durable community consensus despite initial vote momentum for change.",
