DFX is the governance token of DFX Finance which allows users to vote on protocol changes and initiatives of the DAO, and also allows users to receive boosted emissions on deposits within the DFX ecosystem.\n\n**Price History DFX:**\n\nPrice History for DFX can be found on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfx-finance)\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe DFX token on L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon is migrating from a bridged token to a Chainlink CCIP token. As well, DFX Finance is committed to continue to engage in the Hiddenhand Finance ecosystem in a meaningful way to further deepen DFX liquidity onchain.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. Governance: DFX tokens serve as the governance token for the DFX Finance protocol. DFX token holders can vote on governance proposals through DFX’s snapshot. DFX forum is also used to discuss potential protocol changes and improvements.\n2. Oracles: DFX token does not rely on any external oracles. The DFX stablecoin pools uses Chainlink for its real world forex price feeds to facilitate efficient stablecoin swaps close to the spot price. The feeds can be found here: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat)\n3. Audits: DFX has engaged with multiple auditors including engagements with Trail of Bits, Haechi, and Zellic to audit the DFX smart contracts.\n4. Centralization vectors: Treasury functions are controlled by a 2/4 multisig including treasury yield farming, and paying bribes.\n5. Market History: DFX has been transferable since March 2021.\n6. Value: This pool will be the primary source of liquidity for DFX on Arbitrum and Polygon\n\n**40DFX-20USDC-40TEL - Polygon**\nPool: [0xc260f3c5a57caf193d1813d8fd0a02442073d6fa](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc260f3c5a57caf193d1813d8fd0a02442073d6fa)\nGauge: [0x15639b2F9159DFD4ACF8eCf56222421ead906826](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x15639b2F9159DFD4ACF8eCf56222421ead906826)\nRoot Gauge: [0xe9b5f4d892Df284a15Ec90A58bd4385E57964f18](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe9b5f4d892Df284a15Ec90A58bd4385E57964f18)\n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xe9b5f4d892Df284a15Ec90A58bd4385E57964f18`\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon`",

Threshold DAO intends this pool to be a part of the long-term tBTC strategy.\n\n### Specifications:\n\n>1. Governance:\n> tBTC operates on Threshold DAO’s decentralized threshold encryption protocol. Threshold DAO is governed by the network’s work token, T. T token holders govern the DAO via proposals raised to the Threshold forum, which can be raised to a vote via Snapshot, as well as the on-chain Governor Bravo module via Boardroom.\n> tBTC contract deployments are currently managed via the Council multi-sig, a 6-of-9 multi sig managed by trusted community members: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n>In the future, all contract authorities will be passed to the Governor Bravo contract.\n\n> 2.

This pool uses a Chainlink data feed as rate provider for Euro, which enables the utilization of a stable pool despite being two different assets.\n\nA boosted pool like this one was created two months ago and has shown early signs of profitability, even when the Euro appreciated 5% vs the USD in this timeframe, and then came back to just +2%. \n\n# References/Useful links:\n\n## Monerium:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Websites: https://monerium.com/\n* Code: [Monerium · GitHub](https://github.com/monerium/)\n* Social: https://twitter.com/monerium\n\n# Protocol Description:\n\n## Monerium\n\nMonerium is authorised and regulated as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI). Monerium offers services to residents of the European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland. Monerium is authorised to issue e-money tokens on blockchains.\n\nMonerium issues the EURe, a Euro stablecoin with a 102% backing. EURe is more than one-to-one backed in high-quality liquid assets and is redeemable on demand. Unlike a bank, an Electronic Money Institution can only safeguard customer funds but not make loans.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nEURe is set to become a core piece of the Gnosis Chain ecosystem, and creating deep liquidity for such an asset is crucial. At the moment, Gnosis DAO has been incentivising a Curve v2 pool where there is USD 8M worth of liquidity, but the peg hasn’t performed extremely well, being priced up to -2% vs EUR at some points. Enabling a gauge in Balancer would allow us to make this liquidity more efficient.\n\nAs mentioned before, this pool was created two months ago and Gnosis DAO deposited USD 100k for testing purposes. With this amount of liquidity, volume wasn’t very high.\n\nHowever, a few takes can be made\n\n* In this two months, EURO has appreciated up to 4.5% when it was priced at $1.1245 and then came back to 1.0928 (all prices were taken from Chainlink [oracle](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/fiat/eur-usd))\n* The pool made $216 in fees\n* The P&L of LP vs HODL was $161, meaning that Impermanent Loss was $55.\n* We can expect to have higher volume and fees once more liquidity is deployed.\n* I have taken several snapshots of these values over these two months. At all points, the position was profitable. However, when the pool was imbalanced and EURe was trading below 1 euro, the impermanent loss was larger. Still, at these times, the LP was profitable. These snapshots can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19nXaY-TZaljPfUjNwW8CBepcWV6atZmfuI0uqgpqHuY/edit#gid=0)\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1. Governance:\n\n  - Gnosis’ forum [here](https://forum.gnosis.io/)\n  - Monerium has no on-chain governance.\n\n2. Oracles: The pool uses a [Chainlink price feed](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xe7511f6e5c593007ea8a7f52af4b066333765e03) for EURe price.\n3. Audits: N/A\n\n4. Centralizing vector: Monerium is backed by Euros.\n5. Market history: EURe has been live since May 2022 as Monerium can be minted/redeemed against Euros, it has held its peg even though its low liquidity creates stability issue time to time (always arbed).\n6. Value: The pool can become the main source of liquidity for EURe.\n\n# Contracts\n\n* EURe Balancer Pool (Gnosis Chain): [0x0c1b9ce6bf6c01f587c2ee98b0ef4b20c6648753](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x0c1b9ce6bf6c01f587c2ee98b0ef4b20c6648753) (AMP 20; trading fees 0.05%).\n* EURe token (Gnosis Chain): [0xcB444e90D8198415266c6a2724b7900fb12FC56E](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xcB444e90D8198415266c6a2724b7900fb12FC56E)\n* staBAL3 (Gnosis Chain): [0x2086f52651837600180de173b09470f54ef74910](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x2086f52651837600180de173b09470f54ef74910)\n* Gauge in Gnosis Chain: [0x492cd2290e5b971eab622d6325cef6a329cf8a58](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x492cd2290e5b971eab622d6325cef6a329cf8a58)\n* Gauge in Mainnet: [0x399A750516c14C80480AED2Bb597092b9118Caa9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x399a750516c14c80480aed2bb597092b9118caa9)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd`and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x399A750516c14C80480AED2Bb597092b9118Caa9 `\ngaugeType(string): `Gnosis`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/599\n\n## Summary:\n\nProposal to add gauge support for 50/50 tBTC/WETH and 50/50 tBTC/USDbC pool on Base.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Website: https://threshold.network\n* Explorer: https://tbtcscan.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.threshold.network/\n* Github Page: https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2\n* Forum: https://forum.threshold.network/\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Threshold\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/tBTC_project\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin, that is 1:1 backed by mainnet BTC.\n\nUnlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimised and redeemable for mainnet BTC without a centralized custodian.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the 50/50 tBTC/WETH pool and 50/50 tBTC/USDbC pool on Base.\n\nThreshold DAO seeks to build deep liquidity on Base, and Balancer is an ideal venue to build upon. These pools are key strategic pools, central to the long term growth strategy of Threshold DAO.\n\nThe DAO has budgeted T token bribes to incentivise this pool.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n### 1 Governance:\n\ntBTC operates on Threshold DAO’s decentralized threshold encryption protocol. Threshold DAO is governed by the network’s work token, T. T token holders govern the DAO via proposals raised to the Threshold forum, which can be raised to a vote via Snapshot, as well as the on-chain Governor Bravo module via Boardroom.\n\ntBTC contract deployments are currently managed via the Council multi-sig, a 6-of-9 multi sig managed by trusted community members: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\nIn the future, all contract authorities will be passed to the Governor Bravo contract.\n\n### 2 Oracles:\n\ntBTC does not rely on an oracle price feed.\n\n### 3 Audits:\n\nLeast Authority: https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-keep-network-tbtc-bridge-v2/\n\nChainsecurity: https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/threshold-network/\n\nCertik: https://skynet.certik.com/projects/threshold-network\n\nImmunefi Bug Bounty: https://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\n### 4 Centralization vectors:\n\nThreshold Network governance is decentralized, and updates are ratified by the DAO.\n\ntBTC contracts updates are currently managed by the Council multi-sig.\n\n### 5 Market History:\n\ntBTC is a wrapped BTC token, and is pegged to the price of BTC. Since launch, tBTC’s price has not significantly diverged from that of BTC. tBTC launched in January of 2023, and currently has ~2400 BTC to collateralize the ~2400 tBTC.\n\n### 6 Pool Details:\n\n#### tBTC/WETH Pool\n\nLink to Pool: [0x52e281318Fed4eFFfb8E46c0847a8f9B71a461A8](https://basescan.org/address/0x52e281318Fed4eFFfb8E46c0847a8f9B71a461A8)\n\nBase Gauge: [0xFA61fB6218378b9f01CA4B2b662B5c4d12915Db9](https://basescan.org/address/0xFA61fB6218378b9f01CA4B2b662B5c4d12915Db9)\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb)\n\n#### tBTC/USDbC Pool\n\nLink to Pool: [0x036d68e4e0005da4ef1c9ebd53b948d2c083495e](https://basescan.org/address/0x036d68e4e0005da4ef1c9ebd53b948d2c083495e#readContract)\n\nBase Gauge: [0x4321edfE7dEC773A91316481FCb19D6ca6Dc5207](https://basescan.org/address/0x4321edfE7dEC773A91316481FCb19D6ca6Dc5207)\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b](https://etherscan.io/address/0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b)\n\n### Value:\n\nThe Balancer tBTC pools will support tBTC routing and liquidity on Base.\n\nThreshold DAO has allocated a portion of its incentives budget to bribe these pools Paladin. This will incentivise veBAL holders to vote on our gauge to direct protocol emissions and attract TVL as part of the Base tBTC growth strategy.\n\n Specification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb `\ngaugeType(string): `Base`\n\ngauge(address):`0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b `\ngaugeType(string): `Base`",
