The BB-A-USD token is to be deposited 50% directly into the Balancer gauge and 50% into Aura Finance's contract.\n\nAave DAO will earn BAL, AURA, swap fees and yield from Aave v3 via the linear pools. $3M is to be allocated to this strategy and the expected yield is around 9.3% without any boost from Aave's future veBAL holding.\n\nAave DAO will also gain the ability to create a BB-A-USD/GHO pool using BB-A-USD acquired by this proposal. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe current aethUSDC, aethDAI and aethUSDT holdings are shown below:\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.33.46.png](ipfs://bafkreifdz3sr45ieb77kmgsuzzir6ygvasygtstcd5rlyxipxd3gaz3v2u)\n The below shows the amount of DAI and USDT being migrated from Aave v2 to v3.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V2|USDT|3,119,535.51| $3,119,535.51 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V2|DAI|2,894,904.40| $2,894,904.40 |\n||||| $6,014,439.91 |\n\nThe table below shows the Aave v3 holdings after Part 2 of 3 has been implemented.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|3,155,411.89| $3,155,411.89 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|2,903,799.83| $2,903,799.83 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDC|58,173.59| $58,173.59 |\n|||||$6,117,385.31|\n\nAfter allocating $3.00M to BB-A-USD, Aave will have the following v3 holdings.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|1,655,411.89| $1,655,411.89 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|1,403,799.83| $1,403,799.83 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDC|58,173.59| $58,173.59 |\n|||||$3,117,385.31|\n\nThe aethUSDC is to remain deposited in Aave v3 and accumulate over time to facilitate any future Service Providers request for payment.\n\nAave also holds 4.5M of aUSDC on Aave v2 from Part 1 of 3 asset consolidation.\n\nWith the new [Aave v3 Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xfebb0bbf162e64fb9d0dfe186e517d84c395f016000000000000000000000502) created, gauge contract deployed and [Aura Finance integration](https://app.aura.finance/#/pool/81) complete, Aave DAO can now proceed attain the BB-A-USD and use it to earn yield. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.31.34.png](ipfs://bafkreicfefc3xsoel3sg64unqty4piq6pgzl44y6fza5i3544lh77tenvu)\n    \nAt the time of writing, routing a swap from stable coin to BB-A-USD incurs positive slippage. This is true for using all three stable coins. When setting the parameters for acquiring the BB-A-USD token, a maximum price impact of 0.20% will be used.\n\nThe methodology used for acquiring BB-A-USD will be the same approach used to acquire BB-80BAL-20WETH. \n\nIt has taken months to create a reusable approach that prevents MEV attacks and provides the ability to limit the price impact incurred when performing a swap. The methodology has been reviewed by Cowswap and Bored Ghost Developing.\n\nUpon receiving the BB-A-USD token, 50% is to be deposited into the Aura Finance contract and 50% is to be deposited directly into the Balancer gauge.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following asset holdings are to be redeemed and used for acquiring BB-A-USD.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|1,500,000| $1,500,000 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|1,500,000| $1,500,000 |\n\nDetailed execution details will be provided in the comments prior to submitting the AIP. This will enable Llama and Bored Ghost Developing to optimise the execution methodology.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). \n\n    ",

The publication supports redeeming the assets shown below from v2 Avalanche and deposit them in v3 Avalanche. \n\n \n![Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 09.23.18.png](ipfs://bafkreiggndqcywgealtinsz7yu3s6e7fmpkcla6r5r6fyqnsjd6jrxt6oi)\n    \n\nThe deposit rates on v3 are great than v2 and there is also wAVAX incentives being distributed across v3.\n\nIf required, this proposal is to be implemented via multiple AIPs to ensure there is sufficient Supply Cap capacity to enable funds to be deposited into v3. \n\nDo note, the borrow rate on v2 will increase in response to migrating funds from v2.  \n\nTransferring the DAOs funds from v2 to v3 can be performed via the migration tool developed by @bgdlabs. There are also smaller holdings, example: wAVAX, that can be deposited to earn yield. This proposal will result in ~8.3% of the TVL on v2 being migrated to v3. \n\nFor reference, the Aave Avalanche v2 Treasury: [`0x5ba7fd868c40c16f7aDfAe6CF87121E13FC2F7a0`](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x5ba7fd868c40c16f7aDfAe6CF87121E13FC2F7a0)\n\n# Specification\n\nPerform the following:\n\n* Transfer funds from v2 to v3 via migration tool (can be one or several AIPs, subj. Supply Cap restrictions)\n* Deposit passively held assets into v3 \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] GHO Liquidity Pools: Primary Pools Initial Strategy\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @Dydymoon & @MatthewGraham \ncreated: 2023-07-20\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents the community with an initial repartition of the veBAL gauge weight power to different GHO primary liquidity pools\n\nAdditionally to the DAO voting power, several ecosystem members expressed interest in supporting GHO, pushing the estimated voting power up to ~ 7,7% of the veBAL voting supply.\n\n# Motivation\n\nFollowing on from a successful [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xcf85642329d2f1f54ae8a55bf272e4fa6e231dee3759907f9c2a0d9447cee311) and [B-80BAL-20WETH acquisition](https://twitter.com/CoWSwap/status/1678498134195044361?s=20), the three primary Balancer liquidity pools have been defined and gauge proposals have been submitted with voting ongoing.\n\n* [[BIP-357] Enable GHO/LUSD Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-357-enable-gho-lusd-gauge-ethereum/4963)\n* [[BIP-358] Enable GHO/wstETH Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-358-enable-gho-wsteth-gauge-ethereum/4964)\n* [[BIP-360] Enable GHO/bb-a-USD Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-360-enable-gho-bb-a-usd-gauge-ethereum/4965)\n\nAfter discussion with other teams, two initial secondary pool gauges have been proposed. However, in line with the [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655), the DAO’s veBAL holding should be used to support the three primary pools.\n\nIn addition to Aave DAO’s veBAL holding, several veBAL & vlAURA holders have expressed an intention to help bootstrap GHO liquidity pools. We would like to give a special thank you to the Balancer and Aura community members for their contributions.\n\nThis proposal will try to estimate the gauge power allocated to GHO pools & the potential yield depending on several TVL estimations for each primary pool. In analyzing the potential liquidity conditions, three scenarios are presented.\n\n![|637x109](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/A5xYXlMR_mzanGEWrFjaSNbkao9Zykhi7yKDs2SIMrM_a-mfm9qfsVuX3cmllOazmUkJ-2ewKzf_OKcQ7KOk3UI3UKhiGNrM4L_bW50VDz8Zi9WByYPVVwDRUJU6hclu64kZ96cjz-jFzs2eZnQO7ss)\n\nWhile the initial GHO supply is expected to be 100M, additional cap increases can be implemented and voted so this can also help to visualize how the supported voting power can scale.\n\nFor the purpose of this proposal, it has been assumed that all relevant positions are continuously relocked to maximize the voting rights.\n\nAave DAO is contributing 1.81% of the ~ 7,7% veBAL and the remainder is coming from teams that TokenLogic has been coordinating with. Do note, there are dependencies on these contributors to maintain the voting support over time. Initial discussions indicate that in 2-3 months time, some veBAL and vlAURA holders are expected to revisit there allocations.\n\n## Estimated veBAL gauge power to bootstrap GHO at launch\n\nThe below table presents the initial veBAL and vlAURA expected to support GHO’s launch and Aave DAO’s veBAL holding. Aave DAO holds 157,169.86 B-80BAL-20WETH to be converted to an estimated 1.80% of veBAL supply by [Llama.](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-introducing-strategicassetmanager/13916) The table below shows the distribution of veBAL and vlAURA support for the main three GHO pools.\n\n![|660x69](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5lG1ZsmoHS7KZQGqh61NWikdaq6PbYDnsi2_VcZq1Il4nyF6GenO8_fDM7TACCqXWDDGZBPz5hLZrVYqpS7dgNDXcTQ96pG2MgnWISFhCTLYeAKR6ZNltmYDkr3Gep4BrImZHISaXaipuOoGuBeOEVo)Aave DAO with support from friends is expected to support GHO with 5.5% of veBAL later this week and 7.7% upon Aave DAO converting its B-80BAL-20WETH to veBAL. Subject to timing, some veBAL support from friends may taper when Aave DAO starts voting.\n\n## Estimations of BAL emissions & AURA rewards\n\nThe following estimations are based on vlAURA voting rounds & votes amount, but converted from the actual veBAL equivalent amount of support: 1 vlAURA = 0,1726 veBAL votes.\n\nWe propose Aave DAO split the veBAL voting weight as per below.\n\n* 40% used to vote on the GHO/bb-a-USD V3 pool\n* 40% used to vote on the GHO/LUSD pool\n* 20% used to vote on the 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool\n\nDo note, the voting weight can be changed periodically with each successive gauge vote.\n\n## 1) Aave DAO\n\nThe split proposed below is open for discussion in the comments section. However, later sections show the significance of Aave Friends voting support. We encourage the veBAL and vlAURA support to be view holistically and not just through the lens of Aave DAO’s holding.\n\n![|711x49](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ya2Y1vJVK1Fg3d2gvoREbTGvfYZZQiUa0bhq4OJu0bqnkAyMJSAcXkteAlKQWotthRJAm_8FKZHoII_OMsn9KQmMAaF-v3oNHhB1-V4rhJUEUu3ub2JrRNLPfjjkrELLK6SyDF5r7URWAXSrnGpZi0U)\n\nRewards breakdown for the Aave DAO after the B-80BAL-20WETH is converted to veBAL holding:\n\n![|660x137](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SG0AU1D4fWBjPK6FRSNQ8NVll-IvKk5ZwzTBs61iJYLa8WCbqhj7pABmiJFetg7yQn5x-r7PgqH03cC4UddgYSpskltJBOpS6Z5EYD2Y4NR1yp8qJLUiU2sAIcoAGS_FThOnXItmUtuam5htDH2kWpo)\n\nFor the three TVL scenarios being considered, the following APRs are estimated:\n\n![|660x97](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zi02UdPUDy1BYSeg_N8qZ0SNxkjTsj9zMgQKyP8dlPW5VwBYLv1beBtVeS1Ub1KGTpRorGrVEdp8tzU51YPWnVqDS7Fog_I7fUAdkbqy-pGyzS-dxRU-IO4_MQ0S96EeeEH1SpEErqNyKZDhi53PpEM)\n\nNaturally, TokenLogic will work with the Balancer community to redirect Balancer protocol fee funded vote incentives to preferential pools.

Once the above items are executed, the shortExecutor will implement the above gauge weight votes via the Strategic Asset Manager contract being deployed by Llama.\n\nAlternatively, a Treasury Committee can be created and assigned the AssetManager role enabling the votes to be implemented.\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nWhen presenting the analysis, there are several assumptions that affect the accuracy of the model over time. The most notable variables are mentioned below:\n\n* TVL in the pools\n* Duration of Aave Friends support\n* Frequency of re-locks (maximizing the veBAL voting rights)\n* Vote allocation\n* Aura Boost\n\nTo reduce this dependency on external parties, TokenLogic will publish three proposals in the near future:\n\n* Initiate Protocol Owned Liquidity (leading to increased strategic assets accumulation)\n* Create Treasury Committee\n* Initial GHO Liquidity Incentives Budget\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n@TokenLogic currently receives funding from the Butter Delegate Campaign and is a contributor @Llamaxyz.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Repay Excess CRV Debt on Ethereum v2\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - @MatthewGraham \nDated: 2022-12-08\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis publication proposes sourcing CRV for the purpose of repaying the excess debt in the CRV Reserve on the Ethereum v2 liquidity pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere are approximately 2,656,335 units of CRV of excessive debt in the Ethereum v2 CRV Reserve. At 66.35 cents per unit, a total of 1,762,478.27 USD, in the form of CRV tokens, is required to recapitalise the protocol. \n\nTo recapitalise the protocol, Llama proposes acquiring the full amount of CRV required to repay the excess debt from the existing USDC and aUSDC holdings.\n\nAave currently holds 6M units of aUSDC and 358.7k units of USDC in the Ethereum Collector Contract.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDecide on a path forward to repay the excess debt in the CRV market (currently ~$1.76M USD, dependent on CRV's token price). Llama proposes using funds held in the Aave v2 Collector Contract to repay the excess debt. As the excess debt must be paid in CRV tokens, Aave is required to acquire 2,152,041 units of CRV.\n\nThere is currently an active proposal whereby Gauntlet's insolvency fund (valued at around $280k) is to be transferred to the Economic Reserve. The insolvency fund only offsets a portion of the total cost incurred by Aave. There has been no indication of support from the community for using AAVE held within the Safety Module or from the Ecosystem Reserve to recapitalise the protocol. If Aave was to sell AAVE or stkAAVE to fund the CRV acquisition, there are two non exclusive ways of doing this:\n\n1) Auction via the shortfall event\n2) Swap contract where anyone can swap AAVE or stkAAVE for CRV\n\nOption 2 eliminates the need for negotiating any terms with a counterparty, or any counterparty needing to review contracts prior to interacting with a whitelisted contract. It is worth noting the Collector Contract holds insufficient AAVE or stkAAVE to support using AAVE <> CRV swaps. Any swap contract of this nature requires using the Economic Reserve. General discussion to date has indicated little appetite to sell AAVE to fund excessive debt.  \n\nThere has been some interest from the community to use the aCRV holding, currently 504,294 units, in the Ethereum Collector Contract to partially recapitalise the protocol. This is a partial solution  that is equivalent to just 18.98% ($334.6k) of the required CRV size needed. If the community was to use the aCRV position, a further 1,647,747 units of CRV are to be acquired.\n\nWith the launch of a new aToken, expected soon, Curve liquidity tokens can be deposited into Aave and still receive CRV rewards from the Curve gauges. Aave has the option to deploy the aCRV holding to veCRV and direct rewards towards Curve gauges that benefit the Aave ecosystem. This has the potential to become a meaningful income stream for Aave.\n\nIf Aave was to incur a delay in creating veCRV, historically this is one of the highest yielding reserves which is why CRV is the largest earning asset outside of the major stable coins. In more normal environments, over a 150 to 200 day period, the CRV reserve would generate sufficient yield to repay the excessive debt. This revenue source , CRV yield, would be lost if aCRV was used to fund repaying the excessive debt. Due to the potential upside, this publication supports retaining the aCRV holding.\n\nAs part of a broader consolidation of the Ethereum Collector Contract, approximately [$434.6k of assets](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-collector-contract-consolidation/10909) are to be swapped for USDC. This represents 24.7% of the funds required to recapitalise the protocol.\n\n### Holdings Summary\n\n| Holding          | $ Value     | % of Excessive Debt |\n| --------------   | -----------          | ------------------- |\n| aUSDC            | 6,002,226.07|              340.56      |\n| USDC             | 358,701.07  |                20.35      |\n| v2 Consolidation | 434,570.98  |           24.70      |\n| aCRV             | 330,834.02  |                18.98     |\n| Excessive Debt   | 1,762,478.27|          100       |\n\nThe table shows there is in total 385.61% more USDC relative to the excessive debt value. Do note this is only the USDC portion of the Collector Contract. There is also large DAI ($4,684,700.46) and USDT ($3,915,311.69) holdings.\n\nDue to the relative size of the USDC and the upside potential to the new aToken developed by Aave Companies, Llama suggests the community utilise the USDC and aUSDC holdings to acquire the full amount of CRV needed to recapitalise the protocol.\n\n# Specification\n\nDeploy a swap contract exchanging USDC and aUSDC for CRV. \n\nThe exchange rate is the Chainlink CRV/USD Oracle + 10 bps.\n\nCRV/USD Oracle: `0xCd627aA160A6fA45Eb793D19Ef54f5062F20f33f`\n\nEstimated Premium: 1,762,478.27 * 0.0010 = $1,762.48\nA $15,000 swap via ParaSwap at 14 gwei + depositing into the swap contract is estimated to cost $12 - $15, 10 bps is $15.\n\nA cap of $2M will be placed on swap contract. This is a defined ceiling which limits the amount of funds allocated for acquiring CRV on market. This essentially creates an upper price bound on the CRV price of 75.29 cents, which is a 13% above the current spot price, 66.35 cents. \n\nThe actor interacting with the swap contract will have the ability to select USDC and aUSDC by choosing true or false respectively.\n\nTo repay the excess debt, the repay function will be used. This function requires CRV as an input and the address the bad debt has accumulated within.\n\npool.repay(crv, total bad debt, variableInterest, Address)\n\nCRV: `ethereum:0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52`\nTotal Excessive Debt: 2,656,335 units of CRV\nAddress: `0x57e04786e231af3343562c062e0d058f25dace9e`\n\n# Next Steps\n\nDiscuss in the comment section the above proposal. A Snapshot will be presented for the two most popular options. At the time of writing, these appear to be:\n\nOption 1) Use USDC to acquire CRV\nOption 2) Use aCRV + USDC to acquire CRV\nOption 3) Do Not Recapitalise Protocol\n\nOption 3 gives the community the ability to not recapitalise the protocol.\n\nIf the Community was to prefer to sell AAVE, the preferred mechanism is a swap contract at the AAVE/CRV composite oracle rate. ie: AAVE/USD x USD/CRV >> AAVE/CRV There would be no premium offered such a swap. Let us know what you think in the comments.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

To achieve this, the `EmissionManager` function reassigns an owner to the `Emission_Admin` role for OP, [1,2].\n\nThe wallet with `Emission Admin` permission for OP then controls the distribution of OP and LDO rewards on the Optimism Liquidity Pool. This proposal will enable LDO and OP rewards to be distributed across the Optimism v3 deployment. \n\n# Motivation\n\nEnable Lido DAO to distribute OP rewards across the Optimism v3 Liquidity Pools.\n\nLido DAO is about to receive a grant nominated in OP tokens that are to be used for bootstrapping the adoption of wstETH on the Optimism network. \n\nThe Lido Liquidity Mining Committee (LMC) will be determining the emission rate and duration that OP rewards are offered on the Aave v3 deployment.\n\nTypically, the LMC meets and determines the next 30 days rewards to be distributed on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the OP rewards, or change the amount of OP being offered across the Aave v3 Liquidity Pools on Optimism.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe `EmissionManager`, a governance controlled function, assigns the `Emission_Admin` role for a specified token, OP, on each respective network. \n\nThe `Emission_Admin` role controls the distribution of the specified token, OP, across the specified Aave deployment.\n\nThe `Emission_Admin` can distribute OP anywhere across the Aave v3 on the Optimism Liquidity Pool.\n\nEmission Admin: `0x5033823F27c5f977707B58F0351adcD732C955Dd`\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
