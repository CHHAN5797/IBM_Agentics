Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/dinero-protocol/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n>\n>In addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Dinero Protocol, there are additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n>\n>pxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero Protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n>\n>The governance token for pxETH is DINERO.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Dinero has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Dinero’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the primary venue for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n>\n>An LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Dinero plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nDinero’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://gov.dinero.xyz/). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://github.com/dinero-protocol/audits/tree/master).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/gtWETHe has just been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged.\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Dinero plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n### Technical Specifications:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x3a51bdf9013633Ae934a3630db96f09aE4c5814a`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "[BIP-97] Enable IB/rETH 50/50 Gauge [Optimism]\n\nSummary:\n\nProposal to add a gauge of IB/rETH 50/50 on Optimism\n\nReferences/Useful links:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Website: https://app.ib.xyz/\n* Documentation: https://docs.ib.xyz/\n* Github Page: https://github.com/ibdotxyz\n* Communities:\n  * Twitter: https://twitter.com/ibdotxyz\n  * Medium: https://ibdotxyz.medium.com/\n  * Discord: https://discord.gg/4HwFTcjY78\n* Other useful links?\n\nProtocol Description:\n\n* The proposed asset(s): IB\n* the corresponding protocol(s): Iron Bank - a decentralized lending platform focused on capital efficiency allowing protocols and individuals to supply and borrow cryptoassets.\n* Historic prices of the token (price must come from the source of highest liquidity):\n  * Dexsceener: https://dexscreener.com/optimism/0xefb0d9f51efd52d7589a9083a6d0ca4de416c24900020000000000000000002c-0x00a35fd824c717879bf370e70ac6868b95870dfb-0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006\n  * Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/iron-bank\n\nMotivation/Explain why this pool needs incentivization:\n\n* We would like to expand our liquidity on OP as we continue to provide IB incentives to drive liquidity into our markets on OP. We plan to provide bribe incentives to veBAL holders once the gauge is active, which will bring in both TVL & trading volumes for the balancer/beets.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n* Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n  * Current governance structure: https://docs.ib.xyz/governance\n  * Admin multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/oeth:0xfB9423283EB7F65210B9aB545ecC212B5AE52b3A/\n\n* Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n  * Yes - https://docs.ib.xyz/lending-market/price-oracle\n\n* Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n  * The audit is done by MixBytes and can be found here https://github.com/mixbytes/audits_public/tree/master/Iron%20Bank\n* Centralization vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n  * On IB Optimism, treasury functions and smart contract proxy updates are controlled through a 3/5 multisig\n\n* Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool’s gauge.\n  * The pool has been active since 9/2, 2022 and we’ve directed IB emission to bootstrap the liquidity of this pool.\n  * Currently it has $162K TVL generating over $27K in volume\n  * Link to the pool: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x785f08fb77ec934c01736e30546f87b4daccbe50000200000000000000000041\n  * Link to the capped gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78F50cF01a2Fd78f04da1D9ACF14a51487eC0347#code\n\n* Value: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n  * Yes, this is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for IB.",

        "body": "\n**Summary:**\nWhitelist the gauge for the newly created [AURA/ETH 50/50 Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xcfca23ca9ca720b6e98e3eb9b6aa0ffc4a5c08b9000200000000000000000274)\n\nPreviously, the [proposal for an 80/20 AURA/ETH gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-10-enable-aura-eth-80-20-gauge/3318) was rejected. This 50/50 pool is more in line with Balancers longer term ecosystem plans and will generate much deeper liquidity and trading fees for veBAL. I propose for this new pool to be whitelisted instead.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n   • Website https://aura.finance/\n   • Documentation https://docs.aura.finance/\n   • Github Page https://github.com/aurafinance\n   • Communities discord.gg/aurafinance\n   • Other useful links? https://forum.aura.finance/\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nSee here: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708\n\nCentered around [@BalancerLabs](https://twitter.com/BalancerLabs)’s veBAL, Aura coordinates incentives around vote-escrowed tokens to boost yield potential and governance power of DeFi liquidity providers, governance token stakers and voters.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. The approval of this gauge for the 50/50 AURA/ETH pool will set Aura up for a successful launch period and continue to provide deep liquidity for AURA in the years to come.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    \n\n[Twitter post on multisigs](https://twitter.com/AuraFinance/status/1534353728987275264)\n\nTreasury multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xfc78f8e1Af80A3bF5A1783BB59eD2d1b10f78cA9/home\n\nProtocol multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x5feA4413E3Cc5Cf3A29a49dB41ac0c24850417a0/home\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nhttps://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nAura is a non custodial, non pausable platform.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nLBP - https://app.aura.finance/\n\n\n**Gauge address**\n\n[Vyper_contract | Address 0x275df57d2b23d53e20322b4bb71bf1dcb21d0a00 | Etherscan ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x275df57d2b23d53e20322b4bb71bf1dcb21d0a00)",
