        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/741\n\n## Overview \n\nOriginally proposed and executed upon [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-allocate-balancers-3m-arb/4682), Balancer DAO had deposited 2M ARB along with BAL provide by the treasury, and AURA provided by Aura Finance.  There was a special contract made that these LP tokens are held in that requires a 60 day cooldown period before the funds can be withdrawn. The funds are held in [this contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8d803f7f7e26e586ee90e5a872cf7830e21f7727#code)\n\nThis pool has since incurred a significant amount of IL, and I believe it to be prudent to withdraw from this pool in order to hold onto that ARB and use it at a later date.  There are discussions about leaving 25% in the pool to support bal/aura liquidity on arbitrum, but specifics will come at a later date so we can get the ball rolling to make sure we can withdraw as soon as possible.  \n\n#### Specifications:\n\nThe DAO multisig `0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0 ` will call startCooldown() on the contract at `0x8d803f7f7e26e586ee90e5a872cf7830e21f7727`.  Further actions will come at a later date in a separate proposal.",

Back in Nov’21, a [partnership was approved](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/draft-partnership-agreement-balancerdao-primedao/2363) by governance to seed liquidity in a [D2D/BAL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x8f4205e1604133d1875a3e771ae7e4f2b086563900020000000000000000010e) pool. This pool has suffered severe losses and, as of today, Balancer is practically its sole LP, with ~$32k worth in its position. Currently, the pool sees little to no action and Prime DAO only has incentives to LM on [D2D/USDC (Ethereum)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x27c9f71cc31464b906e0006d4fcbc8900f48f15f00020000000000000000010f) and [D2D/rETH (Arbitrum)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x835772bab114563746da80806930a9e37aa853440002000000000000000004c0).\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal seeks to unstake and withdraw proportionally (50/50) from the position, keeping both the D2D and BAL tokens back in the Treasury.\n\nIt’s our expectation that BAL with grow in value somewhat still correlated to ETH, and D2D might not see the same upside, therefore taking even more IL in this position. This way, we can save whatever BAL we have left (~4k at the time of writing).\n\nThere’s not enough liquidity on-chain to sell D2D and we are not looking to kill our partnership, so other strategies for using the D2D may be presented to governance as appropriate.\n\nNoting that these assets were not under Karpartkey's management.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe DAO multisig on Ethereum 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f interact with the D2D-BAL BPT token contract at `0x8f4205e1604133d1875a3E771AE7e4F2b0865639` and call `transfer` with arguments\n`recipient` as the Maxis LM multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` and\n`amount` as `136955000000000000000000` representing the LP tokens currently held by the DAO multi-sig\nAfter the funds have been transfered to the Maxi LM multi-sig, it will execute a withdrawal and transfer of funds to the Balancer DAO multi-sig concluding the transaction.\n\nPool:  [D2D/BAL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x8f4205e1604133d1875a3e771ae7e4f2b086563900020000000000000000010e)\nBPT Token holdings reference: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8f4205e1604133d1875a3e771ae7e4f2b0865639?a=0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f",

Balancer DAO has a large sum of BAL tokens idle in the treasury, and one of the best possible ways to benefit ourselves and the greater ecosystem would to have BAL available to borrow on Aave. The treasury would earn returns on the deposit, and anyone interested in borrowing BAL would have access. \n\nAt the time of writing 188.34k out of 350k total BAL is deposited in the Aave v3 [module](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3). I propose we deposit 160k, nearly the total remaining supply possible. As time goes on we can increase or decrease this strategy depending on market conditions. \n\nSpecification:\n\nThe DAO Multisig on mainnet `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the BAL token address `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing the `approve` function with spender(address) as Aave v3's proxy `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2` and amount as `160000000000000000000000`. \n\nThen the DAO Multisig will then interact with Aave's contract `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2` by writing the `supply` function with the following arguements: \n- asset: `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` \n- amount: `160000000000000000000000`\n- onBehalfOf: `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`\n- referralCode: `0`",

Recently, Ribbon has since decided to deprecate this covered call strategy vault, and it no longer will be a place for the DAO to earn passive income. The proposal is meant to enable the DAO to claim back the deposited funds to hold in the treasury. \n\n#### Motivation:\n\nAs stated in the Summary, because this position will no longer be supported by Ribbon, the DAO should claim back these funds. Funds can be put to work elsewhere, but there is no sense in leaving them idle with nothing to be gained in the deprecated vault. \n\n#### Specification:\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the Ribbon Vault at `0x2a6B048eB15C7d4ddCa27db4f9A454196898A0Fe` by writing `initiateWithdraw` passing numShares as `200000000000000000000000`. This will take until the expiration of the next Ribbon round to register, at which time the BAL will be released for direct claim. \n\nUpon release, the DAO Multisig will interact with the same Ribbon vault as noted above and write the `completeWithdraw`\n\nThe full payload cannot simulate due to the time dependence of the prior step. \n[initiateWithdraw](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/78d6bcec-7e99-416d-9602-d97f691f4931) simulation\n[Full transaction](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/e56fec9a-382c-4fc6-be21-2679e0e562c7?trace=0.0.2.0.0.1.0.0.0) simulation with revert.",
