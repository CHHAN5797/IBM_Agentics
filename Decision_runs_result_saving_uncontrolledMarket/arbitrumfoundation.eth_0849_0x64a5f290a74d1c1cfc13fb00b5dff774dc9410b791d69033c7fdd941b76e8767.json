        "body": "DODO is submitting clarifications for our LTIPP proposal as detailed below.\n\nThe requested amount is **350k ARB**, which is 50% of the original request.\n\nThe original post and updated comments can be found here:\n\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/dodo-ltipp-application-final/21842/6\n\n### **Summary of Feedback from Votes Against:**\n\n- Lack of detailed milestones and grant breakdown.\n- Excessive grant size.\n- No significant TVL growth over the years.\n\n### **Responses and Updates:**\n\n1. **We have reduced the grant request to 350k ARB, 50% of the original amount.**\n    \n    **Justification for Grant Size and Target Metrics**\n    \n    **Baseline and Target Metrics:**\n    \n    - **Current Metrics on Arbitrum:** Daily trading volume at $5M; TVL at $2M.\n    - **Proposed Targets:** Increase daily trading volume to $15M and TVL to $6M, marking a 200% growth.\n    \n    **Strategic Rationale and Financial Calculations:**\n    \n    - **Historical Data & Market Potential:** Our past campaigns have consistently shown that targeted incentives lead to substantial growth in both trading volume and TVL. For instance, a previous initiative saw a 150% increase in TVL over a six-week period. This success underpins our confidence in achieving the set targets.\n    - **Incentive Plans:**\n        - **Liquidity Provider Incentives:** To achieve a $6M TVL with a competitive 20% APR, the required incentive is calculated at $1,200,000 annually. For the specific campaign period of 12 weeks, this translates to an estimated need of $266,666. At an ARB price of $1.15 (as of April 25, 2024), this equates to approximately 231,883 ARB tokens.\n        - **Trading Volume Incentives:** Aiming for a $15M daily trading volume requires incentives for trading fee rebates projected at $130,000 over 12 weeks. This corresponds to about 113,043 ARB tokens, recalculated with the current ARB price of $1.15.\n2. **We have added detailed milestones:**\n    \n    **Grant Timeline and Milestones:**\n    \n    - **Milestone 1:** Successfully deploy the dPoints system on Arbitrum. Announcement by the end of Week 1.\n    - **Milestone 2:** Stablecoin pair TVL reaches $4 million, average daily volume reaches $6 million by the end of Week 4.\n    - **Milestone 3:** Stablecoin pair TVL reaches $6 million, average daily volume reaches $10 million by the end of Week 8.\n    - **Milestone 4:** Bridge stablecoin LP into the newly launched Orbit L3 DODOchain, ensuring sustainable TVL and trading volume for the pair after the incentive period ends by the end of Week 12.\n3. **TVL growth**\n    \n    DODO has recently announced the launch of the [layer 3 solution DODOchain](https://x.com/DODO_chain/status/1782431708752859395), the first restaked rollup powered by Arbitrum Orbit, focusing on integrating liquidity from other chains. Securing this LTIPP grant will significantly boost the TVL and trading volume on Arbitrum, attracting new users from other ecosystems, who will lock up their assets through our LP pairs on Arbitrum and eventually bridge to DODOchain through the official Arbitrum Bridge.",

        "body": "### Summary\nRage Trade is submitting an amended proposal per the [Clarified Process for Non-Council Recommended Applications](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/clarified-process-for-non-council-recommended-applications-to-move-to-snapshot/23257).\nTo recap, Rage Trade submitted [a proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621) to run weekly and daily trading competitions in the LTIPP initial review round. The proposal aimed to allocate 100% of the LTIPP grant to onboard and reward users via these competitions. The focus was on trading competitions rather than fee rebates because competitions could significantly level the playing field  — ultimately boosting participation. The initial proposal was, however, declined by the council due to two issues: \n- A large ask (1.25M ARB)\n- Too few details on how wash trading risks are handled during the competition.\n\nRage Trade has now made amendments to the initial proposal, including: \n- A reduced ask of 425k ARB \n- Highlighting already existing wash trading measures, including: \n   - Enforcing a minimum trade size\n   - Calculating trader ROI based on the average collateral used during a competition round to ensure fairness between large and small traders\n\nLink to Application Revisions:\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/14\n\n### Revised feedback:\n- [GFXlabs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/15):\n> As one of the initial reviewers, we feel our concerns were addressed and would score this proposal considerably higher. The applicant correctly identified and revised the areas of the grant plan we scored as the weakest and would likely receive a passing grade from GFX if reevaluated formally.\nAs a reminder, the LTIP pilot rules did not allow applicants the ability to revise after formal submission, and so were not able to react to feedback in real time from reviewers.\nAs a second reminder, all reviewers have their own opinions and views, and may or may not overlap on some topics.\n- [404DAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/16):\n> As another reviewer of Rage Trade’s application, we also echo that our initial concerns have been addressed with these revisions. In addition to the revised grant size, Rage Trade has provided a more detailed execution plan that now includes prize distributions and the allocation breakdown between Daily & Weekly competitions. Lastly, we are pleased to see additional thought put towards preventing wash trading in the competitions.\nAs a delegate, we will be supporting this application once it goes live for a vote.\n- [Coinflip](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rage-trade-ltipp-application-final/21621/17):\n> Rage Trade has been a long time integration partner of GMX supporting us with various vaults and now aggregation solutions. I’m glad to see them having taken the feedback from the LTIPP council and brought forward a much improved proposal including revised sizing.\nGlad to confirm support as a delegate for this proposal.\n\n### Key Rage Trade v2 Stats \n- **Total Volume Traded**: $500 Million \n- **Launch Date**: 30th November 2023 (~5 months since launch)\n- **Number of Perps Integrated**: Five (GMX, Hyperliquid, Aevo, dYdX, Synthetix)\n- **Number of Traders**: >3000",

Their project builds on top of GMX adding additional utility to the protocol.\nTheir requested grant size seems reasonable given the current TVL, however, some of their TVL goals are a bit ambitious. Their execution strategy is clear with a detailed list of vaults and pools they will be focusing on.\nWe would’ve liked to have seen some more innovation on the incentive side with a focus on stickiness. Nonetheless, we think the application is sufficient enough to progress to a DAO vote.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe applicant has shown recent signs of growth, and we would like to support increasing that. To that end, it would have been helpful if the applicant identified specific mechanisms that they attribute current or past successes to, and then tailored their grant plan specifically to replicating or scaling that success. Given the size of the grant request, we prefer to see some data to validate a specific execution plan.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote AGAINST Steadefi's proposal.\n\nDetailed proposal who has shown impressive growth since launching v2. Gitcoin Passport implementation is interest to protect against sybils. The grant size on its own is reasonable but do not feel it has been sufficiently justified to effectively 10x TVL by the end of the LTIPP (across both lending and strategy vaults). Much of the justification was drawn around the target and associated assumptions to fill in the blanks to form a path to get there vs. drawing from data to execute against.\"\t\t\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal from Steadefi outlines a comprehensive plan to attract and retain liquidity within the Arbitrum ecosystem through incentivizing users and providing innovative leverage yield strategies. Their detailed roadmap, including specific milestones and KPIs, demonstrates a clear path to achieving their objectives. Additionally, the team's past performance, security measures, and engagement with the community instill confidence in their ability to execute on their plans. The requested grant size and justification are reasonable given their projected impact on TVL and user growth. Overall, Steadefi's proposal aligns well with the objectives of achieving  growth and making it a strong candidate for approval. \n\n*404 Feedback)*\nSteadefi presented a strong application that covered all components of the rubric. Their current usage is a little low for the grant ask and their execution strategy could have used more justification/reasoning behind how they have chosen their pools. However, their proactive approach to sybil attacks by using Gitcoin passport is a plus and we believe this likely leads to a lower grant claim than allocated. Their milestones are effectively designed to measure their success and we appreciate their feasibility component in justifying each KPI. We will be supporting this application.",
