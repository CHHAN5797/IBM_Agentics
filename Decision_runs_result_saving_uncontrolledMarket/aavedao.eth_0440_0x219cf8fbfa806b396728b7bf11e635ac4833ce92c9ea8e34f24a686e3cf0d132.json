        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] TokenLogic - 6 month Service Provider Proposal\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-09-07\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nFollowing a successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x05636d75aae6e99be9c79a6337603f69213d34c3cf0b518842aa994f2ec790bf) this publication seeks to onboard TokenLogic as a Service Provider to Aave DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nTokenLogic has been contributing to Aave for nearly 6 months and this publication formalises our continued contribution to the Aave ecosystem by onboarding the team as a recognised Service Provider.\n\nThis funding will be used to support the TokenLogic team to deliver the scope as outlined in the [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x05636d75aae6e99be9c79a6337603f69213d34c3cf0b518842aa994f2ec790bf).\n\nIf the DAO elects to grant an overlapping scope of work to another service provider, TokenLogic will amend the GHO stream accordingly.\n\nIf other teams within the Aave ecosystem wish to make proposal on topics TokenLogic is working on, we will proactively work with the team to achieve the best outcome for Aave DAO.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following assets in the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO via the Aave Swap contract.\n\n* [350,000 aethDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)\n\nThe AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create a 180-day stream for 350,000 units of GHO. The following address will be the recipient of the stream:\n\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nThis will allow the TokenLogic to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Create and Fund GHO Liquidity Committee\nAuthor: @TokenLogic\nDated: 2023-09-08\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents Aave DAO the opportunity to create and fund the GHO Liquidity Committee for an initial 3 month duration.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the coming weeks, we expect the voting base to reallocate gauge votes away from GHO liquidity pools. This is largely due to those voting for GHO pools incurring an opportunity cost by not participating in the bribe market.\n\nIf the Aave DAO was to lock all of its BPT for veBAL, the gauge vote is equivalent to 1.8% of veBAL. Even with some voters continuing to support GHO, a good portion of the 7.7% will move to other pools. There is also the impact of [AIP-42](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682) for the DAO to consider. Voting support from external teams is expected to taper beyond what Aave DAO can replace with its own strategic assets. Furthermore, as the liquidity pools continue to grow additional gauge voting support is required to maintain the APR over time. Whilst the Aave Safety Module (SM) has the potential to be a more long term sustained solution, integrating BPTs that contain GHO, this requires time to develop and should not be rushed.\n\nMeanwhile, the [GHO price](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/) is consistently trading between 96 cents and 99 cents. When the liquidity in the GHO/Aave Boosted Pool was withdrawn, the GHO peg improved. This is because the pool was >85% GHO and had minimal USDC, USDT and DAI deposits. Increasing the GHO borrow rate is also expected to support the GHO peg as minting GHO to farm rewards in liquidity pools is less profitable.\n\n![|602x231](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7_4E7_tF8xRZe5tUFyoeXnJB3UbWDs7C7aGaohFzMjxM_aBGLmMvAREOjrtIS5yppMcrUaov3Q18-jIGcnjJk4x17wy91VheIUZSkIa0Y2a9Ay_kLTLRZ0w6zKR8PEpjE3jqJIBPzfF)\n\nThe LUSD/GHO pool on Maverick, is also heavily concentrated in GHO and migrating this liquidity to a wider liquidity band pool is expected to also help support the peg.\n\nCreating several concentrated liquidity pools is expected to help improve the GHO peg. These pools will have wide and narrow ranges. Liquidity will need to be migrated from the wide range to the narrow range pool over time. This will require more active management than what on-chain governance allows.\n\nThe recent CRV acquisition indicates the DAO will likely be supporting a GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve Finance. The current CRV holding can be used to kick start a pool, however additional support is likely to be needed to continue growing the pool. There is also a GHOFRAXBP pool being setup by the Frax team which can be co-incentivised. Pending how these pools progress, additional scope/budget may be added at a later stage.\n\nGiven the time sensitive nature of needing to support GHO liquidity, this publication proposes creating a Liquidity Committee with an initial budget. The committee shall focus solely on GHO liquidity and shall consist of a relatively small highly skilled team.\n\nThe Liquidity Committee can support GHO whilst other initiatives are being considered. Even after GHO liquidity pool receipt tokens are integrated into the SM, the Liquidity Committee can participate in bribe markets to boost the yield on the SM integrations.\n\nLonger term the DAO should revisit the impact of the committee and determine if it is still required. Furthermore, the composition of the committee should be revisited at a late date. With this in mind, this proposal suggests the Liquidity Committee’s initial mandate shall last for a 3 month duration.\n\n# Liquidity Strategy\n\nDetails on the liquidity strategy are to be detailed in a separate forum post. The liquidity strategy is to be implemented on the following Decentralise Exchanges:\n\n* Balancer\n* Maverick\n* Uniswap via Bunni\n\nThis forum post is to focus on the creation of the Liquidity Committee and associated fundings.\n\n# Performance Measures\n\nThe following performance measures are proposed:\n\n* Time GHO peg is above 98.5 cents and 99.0 cents\n  * % above/below 98.5 cents over trailing 7 days\n  * % above/below 99.0 cents over trailing 7 days\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Maverick\n  * Target $5M\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Uniswap\n  * Target $5M\n* Improvement in swap size for defined price impact via Cowswap or Paraswap\n  * 0.25% and 0.5% price impact to USDC\n* TVL in Balancer Liquidity Pools\n\nTarget $10M ($5M per pool)\n\nThese measures will be shown on the GHO Analytics platform provided by TokenLogic.\n\n# Committee Structure\n\nThe Liquidity Committee is to consist of 7 signers and will utilise a 4 of 7 SAFE to implement transactions. To ensure there is smooth operational consistency, there are distinct roles within the committee.\n\nTokenLogic will perform the following function:\n\n* Provide analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy\n* Liaise with teams that support the protocols hosting the GHO liquidity\n* Lead & Coordinate the committees weekly activities\n\nAll signers are to provide the following support:\n\n* Provide critical feedback / help refine the strategy\n* Verify and sign transactions\n\nIt should be noted, that actively managing liquidity takes time and effort to stay up to date with the attest events happening across all the protocols supporting GHO liquidity. Verifying transactions as a signer is also a notable time commitment.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe initial 3 months funding for the Liquidity Committee is as shown below:\n\n* 406,000 GHO - Liquidity Incentives\n* 5 ETH - Gas\n\nA breakdown of the Liquidity Incentive budget is shown below:\n![|602x224](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_P69n971i9uu38kLAiBQKpiESXHTZJc__Q6PKuvWCxxp7ZaHn7zU-eEVpFSHFcD1W2ZurPx49T-W4Dg0fY25krVHC07nZ0_XCQtyylq9LPafWuxv-G4Ca-19mWfE2-URZ-6BL94nIhH)\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the incentive budget and strategy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801).\n\nThere is a nominal 5 ETH allowance included in the budget. This amount was arbitrarily selected and ensures the SAFE & signing wallets are well funded.Some transactions can be executed directly from the SAFE.\n\nAny funds not used shall be returned to the Treasury or rolled over into supporting the next iteration of the Liquidity Committee.\n\n# Specification\n\nA Gnosis Safe will be created, this SAFE will hold funds and implement the quests. A small, high context team is proposed to implement the strategies modelled by the TokenLogic team.\n\n|Signer|Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Matthew Graham (TokenLogic)|0xb647055A9915bF9c8021a684E175A353525b9890|\n|Dydymoon (TokenLogic)|0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f|\n|Emilio|0x9C3E82658d10064121048A21c69978D3400abb25|\n|Marc (ACI)|0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4|\n|Figue (Paladin)|0x009d13E9bEC94Bf16791098CE4E5C168D27A9f07|\n|Solarcurve (Balancer)|0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3|\n|TokenBrice (DeFi Collective)|0xAA7A9d80971E58641442774C373C94AaFee87d66|\n\nTo fund the multisig, the following assets within the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO:\n\n* 406,000 [aEthDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n5 ETH and 406,000 units GHO are to be transferred from the Treasury to the Liquidity Committee multisig.\n\nAddress: `here`\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

The initial commit from the Aura Finance team was 400,000 units of vlAURA for an initial 3 month duration.\n\nThis proposal seeks to replace the support from Aura Finance by acquiring 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO. Olympus DAO is reducing there AURA exposure due to change in the Olympus DAO roadmap which is detailed [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3756-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus) and [her](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3967-tap29-aura-solicitation-to-bid).\n\nBased upon the research presented in this [Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682), which details impact AIP-42 by Aura Finance, the most efficient way for Aave DAO to bootstrap GHO is via vlAURA relative to veBAL. \n\nOlympus DAO seeks payment in DAI, at an exchange rate of 0.9470 DAI per unit of AURA. The amount of AURA is 443,674 with a total cost to Aave DAO of 420,159.28 units of DAI. Aave DAO currently holds [2.873M](https://etherscan.io/token/0x028171bca77440897b824ca71d1c56cac55b68a3?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) units of aDAI on Aave v2.\n\n**Olympus DAO is conducting an open forum auction over 3 day period, bids are placed relative to the spot price derived from the AURA/wETH pool on Balancer v2.\n\nThe USD price will be updated within this proposal progressively over the bidding period. Do note, Aave DAO's governance process duration exceeds that of Olympus DAO's which means Aave DAO's voting occurs afterwards and ultimately determines if/when the OTC swap will occur**\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will achieve the following:\n\n* Redeem 420,159.28 units aDAI from Aave v2\n* Exchange 420,159.28 units of DAI for 443,674 units of AURA with Olympus DAO\n\nFor reference, Olympus DAO AURA Holding Address: `0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B`\n\nThe contract shall be developed in collaboration with @MarcZeller and deployed by the ACI team.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

This will enable AGD contributors and grant recipients to be rewarded with GHO, and any other asset held in the AGD's multisig. \n\nWith GHO trading beneath $1, the Aave DAO can acquire GHO on market which will help support the peg and then use the GHO to provide funding to AGD. Distributing GHO  will promote the usage and adoption of GHO.\n\nThe Aave DAO is sending a strong signal of support for GHO by using it to reward contributors to the community. Over time, we hope all AGD and Service Provider expenses are settled in GHO.\n\nThis proposal will likely be implemented around the time the ARFC to increase [GHO's interest rate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-gho-borrow-rate/14612) is to be implemented and the issue flagged [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temporarily-pausing-gho-integration-in-aave/14626) has been resolved. Both proposals are expected to help support the GHO peg.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following assets from the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO. \n\n* 228,000 units of aEthUSDC\n* 150,000 units of aEthUSDT\n\nThe DAI allowance is to be cancelled.\n\nA GHO allowance is to be created to the value of 385,000 units (estimation of GHO acquired from swaps).\n\nThe AGD mulisig `eth:0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0` will be able to use the allowance function on `0xE4621DfD503A533f42bB5a45162eA3e5233Acd5F` to claim the GHO. \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.
