Despite the optimistic projections, the forum sentiment shows notable skepticism about the sustainability and commitment of liquidity providers, with concerns about temporary liquidity and lack of lockup mechanisms. Historical data from a similar proposal indicates that while early vote dynamics favored 'For', post-vote market impacts showed declines, suggesting risks. The timeline metrics show an early and stable lead for 'For', but market impacts are slightly negative. Considering the mixed signals from community sentiment, market impact, and historical lessons, a cautious stance against the proposal is advised.",
