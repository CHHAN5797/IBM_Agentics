        "body": "## Overview\n\nThis proposal continues on the proposed steps from [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719) by recommending the removal of sUSD as collateral on Aave V3’s Optimism. Additionally, we recommend reducing the LT and LTV of the Stablecoin E-Mode on Optimism, which sUSD is part of, and setting sUSD LTV to 0.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis recommendation follows the recent proposal to reduce the supply and borrow cap of sUSD to 10m and 1, respectively; that recommendation follows a period of reduced sUSD DEX liquidity, which dropped to a buy-side low of $2M before recovering after the introduction of token incentives.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151805.225.png](ipfs://bafkreihgsfq3rklem3uewkfzhpofau2fc7mkp742shace72sae7aay3d7i)\nDuring this period, shorting activity on sUSD was observed between January 9th and January 15th. Following the implementation of token incentives on January 16th, as detailed in [this announcement](https://x.com/synthetix_io/status/1878944713446924552), these short positions were closed, and new borrowing demand primarily came from users farming the newly introduced incentives.\n\nBelow, we present a table of the current sUSD borrows on Aave and the associated strategy exposure. The distribution of such strategies seems to be quite dispersed, with the recent incentive structure leading to demand to create perpetual positions on Synthetix coupled with liquidity pool growth rather than short positions.\n\n| User | Action | Size | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0xD8b88C185e06eBF8C58B7dc8b7AFf18304CdD888 | Short | 350k | Jan 9 to Jan 15 |\n| 0x49bf093277bf4dde49c48c6aa55a3bda3eedef68 | LP | 150k | 16th |\n| 0x407cff84eeaacda390fe302c99fa5dd32521bc53 | Holding | 400k | 16th |\n| 0xe31deacee1770dfa56f8849724bcb7f8e5f76ef2 | LP | 130k | 16th |\n| 0xf7ca1f0ff0995c84fef530f7c74c69fb80331e81 | Perp | 200k | 16th |\n| 0x9644a6920bd0a1923c2c6c1dddf691b7a42e8a65 | Perp+LP | 750k | 16th |\n| 0xfd81b27d9796a1ba7d7171ea70010c9befb2a62a | Perp | 380k | 17th |\n\n### Peg Dynamics and Mechanism Design\n\nAn analysis of the peg and utilization dynamics revealed that the deviation can be attributed to a combination of multiple factors, including traders profiting from the Synthetix Perpetual platform, the lack of interest rate on sUSD debt in an environment of heightened rates, and the ongoing migration to Synthetix V3 which reduces the demand for sUSD. This created an imbalance as this excess supply was not met with proportional demand, putting downward pressure on the price of sUSD. This conclusion is supported by the increase in sUSD’s market cap, which closely followed the downward price deviation and the growth in interest rates.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151807.732.png](ipfs://bafybeicynmyw2iywjymc2s6lbeyjbavpcvsdwnqpwxoz2fnd3av36u3kkm)\nWhile this behavior does not pose a risk to sUSD’s fundamental backing, the exit of sUSD’s price from its concentrated liquidity range reduced buy-side liquidity, thereby increasing Aave's risk to sUSD positions. This liquidity constraint underpinned the recommendation to reduce caps, aiming to mitigate Aave's risk.\n\n### Removing sUSD as Collateral\n\nWith the recent deterrence of the creation of new sUSD debt on Aave and continued minimized supply exposure, the majority of outstanding debt is fundamentally leveraged to explicitly contribute to the recent sUSD incentive programs by minimizing effective peg exposure. However, while highly overcollateralized, the current economics associated with the soft peg mechanism is fundamentally shaky; minimizing the usage of sUSD as collateral is recommended to be performed as a preventive measure. The current distribution of such sUSD-collateralized stablecoin debt positions is highly conservative, as can be seen below, thereby requiring a significant depeg to start to contribute negatively to the Aave protocol, and the expectation is such that exposure will continue to be minimized over time, as has been the case with a 3M reduction in supply on Aave (25%) over the last 7 days.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151810.268.png](ipfs://bafkreichtqxkc33sgfqdmovkfkb52lal52eksh3ynamdjoghnkt333o3fe)\n![image - 2025-01-30T151812.842.png](ipfs://bafkreifmjwarbys4s3iecgetat2nmeyxp22qa4r7jyjbsru2qlrrpapvdy)\nMoreover, during a swift depeg event 7 months ago, we proposed an immediate LTV0 change due to the deprecation of their spot synths contributing to significant downward pressure, as can be seen [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719). The fundamental characteristics of the asset eventually improved once more through mechanical changes on Synthetix’s side in the redemption process, leading to the unfreezing of the asset, as seen in [this](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-parameter-recommendations-susd-on-v3-optimism-05-23-2024/17779) post. However, we continued to reduce exposure in the form of decreasing caps significantly coupled with decreasing LTV/LTs in both the general market and E-Mode configuration, leading to a more conservative state. As such, a significant buffer of 6% price movement already exists between the collateral value at the LT and the bad debt threshold of 1/(1+LB) in e-mode itself.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo further improve this safety buffer and given the conservative distribution of collateralized debt positions throughout the stablecoin E-Mode config on Optimism, we recommend decreasing the LTV/LT in Stablecoins E-Mode while minimizing induced liquidations.\n\nConsidering the current positioning within the E-Mode, we estimate the optimal LT reduction to be 87%. While we intend to deprecate the E-Mode and remove sUSD from it progressively, this change poses an initial step in that direction. Chaos Labs will monitor the market and introduce additional Liquid E-Modes if demand for a stablecoin-correlated E-Mode remains.\n\nThe change to 87% LT is expected to cause the liquidation of just $95K of collateral.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151815.223.png](ipfs://bafkreihlu36ppeeaml3zkpfe7vuf2iqfakfent4yzb2n3i3xqnpw7ixwpm)\nThe liquidations caused at the recommended LT are primarily stablecoins with significant liquidity to support the minimal liquidation size, with sUSD liquidations only representing $2.4K, or 3.2%.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151817.770.png](ipfs://bafkreieomtso2cfoswuhmg6ehmc4sdsxd3wrrdtgicbzd57u44tgetqlmu)\nAdditionally, we recommend setting the LTV of sUSD outside of the Stablecoin Correlated E-Mode to 0; this measure will prevent additional borrowing from being performed using sUSD as collateral, hence limiting the future risk posed by an sUSD downward deviation. \n\nThis measure will simultaneously apply to both sUSD parameters within and outside of the E-Mode, hence limiting the opening of new positions.\n\nFollowing an improvement of the sUSD peg and a reduction in sUSD-denominated collateral, Chaos Labs will reinstate the borrow cap to a defined value determined by our methodology.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the sUSD asset on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Asset | Deployment | Current LTV | Rec. LTV |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sUSD | Optimism | 60.00% | 0.00% |\n\nFor the Stablecoin E-Mode on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Rec. Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LTV | 90.00% | 0.00% |\n| LT | 93.00% | 87.00% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

This phenomenon can be explained by the drop-off in ETH staking yield, as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies. Additionally, given Aave prices stETH:ETH 1:1 with the underlying exchange rate, minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements.\n\n**Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY**\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidezrni5upml4xk4kzuchihyd4magrivgd5dvkpicynhrl6atenjy)\n    \n*Correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY.*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihrjropidawamiki4v4bchp6lgb4fwp2rhvodamveeec4vcqwpgoy)\n    \n*Cross-correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*\n\nComputing the cross-correlation between the three markets, we notice an approximately 1-week lag when this hits the maximum value, implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY.\n\nThis is statistically significant, as we can see below, where 85%-90% of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain.\n\n**Arbitrum**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia4qecvzmgfvjxdoicw3vl2hwd5fvddg72pckqd6dvcdhljvqowia)\n    \n\n**Optimism**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibvtx2mcru2gie5oaek3pqcj2bxohv5zxw4f4pv3jjgcliz7yicxe)\n    \n\n**Ethereum**\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihjoo5senhh2qa747ap4ly2sfhva2zby5ex3lvmeffumryilyfp3y)\n    \n### stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY\n\nInterestingly enough, one might think that as stETH yields decrease, looping strategies would become less profitable. However, upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY (stETH APY - WETH APY) alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t, a negative correlation emerges, with the peak occurring at a 2-week lag. Essentially, this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY. Thus, we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high, borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible, leading to convergence at lower yields. On the contrary, when stETH APYs are low, borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping, perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable, leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high. This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low.\n\n**stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeie4ng55vhthsijbs6l676atj6rjpbatve7w2tufcl3mkccqukocqu)\n    \n*Time series of stETH APY - WETH APY. stETH APY plotted on secondary axis.*\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihq7kfchngvinlhhneqnuqu4aamzfasf3d5e6gxddnh4rh5zkxbj4)\n    \n*Cross-correlation between (stETH - WETH borrow APY) and stETH APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*\n\n**WETH Utilization Rates**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihjpcivhoywbhley2ysf4zaaa7nqmkqtsx7f3rt33dvphemir6w4u)\n    \n*WETH Utilization rate time series.*\n\nBased on the observed trend, it's evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues. While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization, it remains suboptimal. Thus, we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease, which returned 0.6%, to derive the decrease in slope1. Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 0.6% variance, any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility. In such a scenario, it would be prudent to revert slope1. However, given the current trend and staking APY, this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO.\n\nAssuming convergence at today’s WETH interest rates:\n\n|  | Arbitrum | Optimism |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Old Utilization Rate | 68.69% | 65% |\n| New Utilization Rate | 76.5% | 72% |\n| Projected Revenue Increase | 13.62 ETH $38.5k year | 4 ETH $11.3k year |\n\nWe note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other non-Ethereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant, as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral, there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months.\n\n###  Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset |Parameter | Currebt |Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | ---| ---|\n| Arbitrum | WETH |Slope1| 3.3% | 3% |\n| Optimism | WETH|Slope1|3.3% | 3% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust ten (10) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across five (5) Aave V3 assets.\n\n- GNO on Gnosis\n- OP on Optimism\n- ARB on Arbitrum\n- stMATIC on Polygon\n- MaticX on Polygon\n\n## Analysis\n\nIncreasing the liquidation threshold and LTV for assets allows Aave to enhance users’ capital efficiency. However, this must be balanced with proper risk management to ensure that there is a sufficient buffer in the event of large drawdowns and/or liquidations. The analyses below were conducted utilizing our LT simulations, which showed either minimal or no increases in VaR at the recommended LT levels, while also considering user distribution and on-chain liquidity.\n\n### GNO (Gnosis)\n\nGNO is in isolation mode with a debt ceiling of $2M, with $971K borrowed against it, split between USDC and WXDAI. The top suppliers of GNO have strong health scores of over 3, while some do not borrow against GNO.\n\nGiven the user distribution and liquidity, we recommend increasing the LT to 53% and the LTV to 48%.\n\n### OP (Optimism)\n\nUSDC and USDT are the most popular assets borrowed against OP collateral, together with DAI representing 71% of the total debt against OP. These positions are thus at risk of liquidation should OP’s price fall. \n\nHowever, the largest suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores and on-chain liquidity would support their liquidation.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### ARB (Arbitrum)\n\nThere is currently $5.64M borrowed against $28.5M ARB in this market, the majority of which is stablecoins.\n\nCollateral at risk increases smoothly as ARB’s price declines, and we find that on-chain liquidity can support efficient liquidations. \n\nGiven this, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### stMATIC (Polygon)\n\nThere is $6.28M borrowed against $30.09M stMATIC in this market, with $2.4M of that borrowed in E-Mode. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of USDC.e.\n\nThe top suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores, with the largest borrowing just $82K against $12M stMATIC, putting this market at relatively lower risk of large scale liquidations.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 48% and the LT to 58%.\n\n### MaticX (Polygon)\n\n75% of the value borrowed against MaticX is associated with MATIC-correlated assets in E-Mode, putting these positions at a relatively lower risk of liquidation. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of stablecoins, with USCD.e the largest.\n\nThe largest MaticX suppliers are either looping with WMATIC, borrowing a small amount of WETH, or borrowing USDC.e. \n\nGiven on-chain liquidity and user distribution, we recommend increasing the LTV to 50% and the LT to 60%.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend making the following changes:\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec. LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gnosis | GNO | 45% | 48% | 50% | 53% |\n| Optimism | OP | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Arbitrum | ARB | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Polygon | stMATIC | 45% | 48% | 56% | 58% |\n| Polygon | MaticX | 45% | 50% | 58% | 60% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "# **Follow-up post-DSR increase to 15% APR**\n\nFollowing the [recent increase](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-out-of-schedule-executive-vote-increase-edsr-increase-stability-fees-decrease-gsm-delay-usdc-psm-throughput-change-trigger-spark-proxy-spell-march-8-2024) in sDAI APR from 5% to 15%, aimed at maintaining adequate DAI demand and alleviating DAI selling pressure in the current risk-on market, we anticipate stablecoin rates to rise significantly above the initially proposed slope1 values due to the rate arbitrage opportunity. Therefore, we are revising our initial \"conservative\" and \"aggressive\" slope1 recommendations accordingly.\n\nOur updated \"conservative\" value will be set at 12%, assuming that rates will revert to a longer-term mean similar to current levels. This adjustment considers the effective cost and anticipates the closure of existing DAI CDPs due to increased stability fees alongside the rising demand for sDAI deposits. As a result, sDAI rates are expected to revert or gradually decrease over time. While this is still a significant increase, the current trend in stablecoin rates suggests a need for a middle ground to align with the short-term expected rate hike. This is particularly relevant given the unexpected duration until the aforementioned rate decreases, considering the size of the MakerDAO reserves.\n\nOur recommendation of 14% for slope1 implies a convergence towards the expected yield of sDAI, aimed at mitigating short-term rate volatility and discouraging deviations above UOptimal. If the yield on sDAI decreases or the market-priced stablecoin rate reverts to a decreased value, we will adjust slope1 accordingly.\n\n# Adjusted Recommendations\n\n| Market | Asset | Current Slope1 | Rec Slope1 Conservative | Rec Slope1 Aggressive |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | FRAX | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | sUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | GUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | LUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDP | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | FRAX | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | LUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | pyUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | crvUSD | 5% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V2 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | MAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | FRAX | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V2 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | MAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | EURA | 4% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | EURS | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDC.e | 7% | 13% | 15% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | sUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | LUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | MAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDC.e | 7% | 13% | 15% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC.e | 7% | 13% | 15% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | LUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | FRAX | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | MAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | EURS | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Base V3 | USDbC | 7% | 13% | 15% |\n| Base V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Metis V3 | USDC | 6% | No Change | No Change |\n| Metis V3 | USDT | 6% | No Change | No Change |\n| BNB Chain V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| BNB Chain V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| BNB Chain V3 | FDUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Scroll V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Gnosis V3 | sDAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Gnosis V3 | WXDAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Gnosis V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n# Increase Uoptimal to 92% for USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum V3\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe recent surge in both supply and demand in stablecoin markets, combined with the limited use of supplied stablecoins as collateral, provides an opportunity to enhance capital efficiency in the market. This enhancement is facilitated by the substantial increase in slope1 to align rates with market demand, achieved by raising the optimal utilization (Uoptimal) from 90% to 92%. Empirical data supports this proposal, as detailed below.\n\n### Historical Stablecoin Utilization as Collateral\n\nTo evaluate the feasibility of increasing UOptimal to improve capital efficiency, we examine the proportion of supplied stablecoins utilized as collateral. This analysis is critical because liquidations necessitate ample liquidity, and any adjustment to UOptimal must offer a suitable buffer to prevent the system from encountering excessively high utilization rate ranges.\n\nBelow, we present a time series of USDC, USDT, and DAI utilization as collateral relative to the total supplied value at a given time t. This metric quantifies the total dollar value of volatile debt collateralized by these stablecoins, providing insights into the relative \"health\" of the market and the potential effects of any theoretical upward price movement in the underlying debt asset.\n\n\n\n### Liquidations\n\nOver the last 90 days, despite ETH doubling in price, only $1.8 million worth of collective USDC, USDT, and DAI collateral has been seized through liquidations on Ethereum V3, with 61% of this value originating from DAI collateral. This amount represents just 0.1% of all currently supplied USDT, USDC, and DAI, indicating minimal leverage employed against stablecoins overall.\n\n### Account Distribution\n\nThe dispersion of supplied stablecoin assets is a crucial metric in defining the user experience of stablecoin suppliers, ensuring ample liquidity for them to withdraw all or most of their supply according to the defined Uoptimal. Additionally, the concentration of debt backed by stablecoin collateral gauges the potential for some users to withdraw or get liquidated, which could lead to a significant shock in the system. Plotting the distribution of total supplied USDC, USDT, and DAI on a per-account basis, we observe a healthy distribution, with the majority of supplied accounts employing zero debt, resulting in an infinite health factor.\n\n\n### Historical Utilization Rate\n\nIn the last three months, the utilization rate has consistently remained above the current Uoptimal by approximately 0.5% to 2%, as depicted by the 7-day moving average of the utilization rate. Currently, yield convergence is observed at a 91.5% to 92% utilization rate, considering the current slope1 value of 6%. This trend is primarily attributed to the exceptionally high USDe speculative yields and the general demand for stable leverage in an upward market. The recent jump, however, can additionally be attributed to the increase in the sDAI rate to 15%.\n\nBased on the data regarding the utilization and distribution of stablecoin collateral presented above, we propose increasing UOptimal to 92% for USDC, USDT and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum. This adjustment, coupled with an elevated slope1, aims to maintain market competitiveness and reduce volatility in the stablecoin market.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Current Uoptimal | Recommended Uoptimal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USDC | 90% | 92% |\n| USDT | 90% | 92% |\n| DAI | 90% | 92% |",

        "body": "### Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes to make adjustments to stablecoin interest rate models across Aave v2 and v3 markets. Specifically, this ARFC proposes to increase the slope 1 parameter for stablecoins to implement a 5% optimal borrow rate.\n\nForum discussion thread linked [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096).\n\n### Motivation\n\nOver the past several months, equilibrium stablecoin borrowing costs across the broader defi space have trended upwards, and may now be higher than the governance defined “optimal borrow rate” set within Aave’s stablecoin interest rate models. For example, Maker borrow and supply (DSR) rates have been mostly over 5% since mid August. Rates in tradfi have also risen significantly, with short term treasury bills yielding around 5.5% and even long term treasury rates rising to nearly 5% across various maturities.\n\nThis mismatch between Aave’s rate models and the broader market leads to a range of potential inefficiencies, including deadweight loss from the cost of liquidity being artificially constrained away from equilibrium value, and negative UX impact due to greater rate volatility when utilization is above the optimal ratio.\n\nFirst, we present data backing up the assertion that Aave’s current stablecoin rate models are not finding efficient market equilibriums. Then, we discuss the negative impacts of this including deadweight loss and UX impacts. Finally, we present a plan of adjustment that we estimate will address the market inefficiencies and lead to improved market utility across borrowers, suppliers, and the community of AAVE token holders.\n\n#### UX Impacts\n\nWe gathered block by block interest rate data for the largest stablecoin markets across v2 and v3 (USDC, USDT, and DAI) from 1 August to 7 October, block numbers 17816255 to 18300344. \n\nIn the middle of this period (28 August), Aave governance executed proposal 306, which added sDAI as collateral on v3 while increasing the slope1 parameter for DAI to 5% on both v2 and v3. This offers useful data to A/B test the premise of whether increasing the borrow rate at optimal utilization can help improve market functioning.\n\nReviewing data for the Aave v3 DAI market, we can see that the increase in slope1 was strikingly effective at reducing borrow rate volatility, with the percent of time utilization was above optimal point falling from 62% to below 1%. There were some confounding factors, such as market turbulence over CRV leveraged positions at the beginning of August, and Maker’s elevated 8% DSR rate effective from 4 August to 18 August. But we can see heightened rate volatility from utilization exceeding the optimal ratio persists even excluding these periods.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihm2rujbkmv7o6lanrmlzqey5op32l56s4ac6z5hsdhkdmctkdftu)\nSource: [Stablecoins ARFC Market Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EV1NfAlYEqpOkbusduCSC5srFHEAH8ijmr8gn7nAa-E/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihueexjztvdyxf2gfegwrfclnr23dwuhrxcrgh3axgalsfc27ulcm)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (DAI v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/DAI/)\n\nComparing this with historical rates data for Ethereum v3 USDC and USDT markets (shown below), we can see a significant reduction in borrow rate volatility from the increase in the slope1 parameter. Note that the USDC market seems to exhibit higher volatility because it has a slope1 parameter of 3.5%, vs 4% for the USDT market.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihwzbrm4e4vn7x7b62bkbsn6hmkzjtwdkv5i6mxos4rxvs2v6sfh4)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (USDC v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/USDC/)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidveiwtydsstbqa7yiy7aevrepjfdauqkgfenzeajehxjfmwc32d4)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (USDT v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/USDT/)\n\nWe can expect reduced rate volatility to drive an increase in borrower participation. Paradoxically, raising the slope1 parameter for the DAI markets also seems to have been associated with a reduction in average (geometric mean) borrowing rates; for example, the average v3 DAI borrow cost from 1 August to 28 August (when proposal 306 was executed) was 6.49%, while the average rate from 28 August to 7 October was 4.56%.\n\nLooking at the USDC v3 market over the same 28 August to 7 September period, we see the average (geometric mean) borrowing rates were 4.52%, so similar to DAI after the adjustment to interest rate models but with much higher volatility. This supports the notion that raising slope1 can bring greater rate stability without negatively impacting borrower welfare.\n\n#### Deadweight Loss\n\nDeadweight loss is an economic concept that describes the loss of total utility created by a market when prices are artificially constrained either above or below the optimal equilibrium where supply and demand are in balance.\n\nIt is commonly demonstrated with graphs of the supply and demand curve; any quantities exchanged below borrowers’ (consumers’) marginal willingness to pay represents consumer surplus, while quantities exchanged over suppliers’ (producers’) marginal willingness to produce represents producer surplus, and together these represent the markets overall utility.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxeijjhirs447bgwpqjltouti3kyjkilleuqob3tjq43j7apzmkm)\n    \nWhen prices are artificially constrained above or below the market equilibrium, this leads to a lower quantity of goods exchanged, which reduces the total area of consumer and producer surplus and creates an area on the graph showing reduced utility known as deadweight loss.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaybtbjwlkyvl2bcak57kpmvdf2ozuwoxvs5anc7pi27ol767mbqa)\n    \nWith borrowing rates at optimal utilization falling below broader market levels, this can have the unintentional effect of constraining price below equilibrium value, which reduces overall utility of the Aave stablecoin markets. This has a likelihood to constrain market size growth over the medium term as suppliers are insufficiently incentivized to deposit more capital, while borrowers have a very low amount of liquidity available at reasonable prices before pushing the utilization above the optimal point and potentially pushing rates far above the market equilibrium.\n\n### Proposed Adjustments\n\nWe propose an adjustment to the variable slope1 parameter for stablecoins across Aave v2 and v3 markets to better align optimal utilization rates with the broader market. While the proposal initially referred only to Ethereum markets, we see similar high rate conditions persisting across markets on other chains and risk service providers have indicated support for updating optimal rates across all active Aave deployments.\n\nThis will result in borrowing rates at optimal utilization still being equal or slightly below most other defi options (eg. Maker and Spark rates), while significantly increasing supply rates. Increasing the expected supply rates for stablecoins on Aave v3 Ethereum market may lead to a bit more downward price pressure on GHO, but this is not expected to be material considering that users can already borrow GHO with sDAI collateral (at 5% collateral yield, likely higher than the average for other stablecoin markets after this change) and Aave governance is also considering additional measures to support the GHO peg.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Ethereum v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n- Set sUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set GUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDP slope1 to 5%\n\n**Ethereum v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n\n**Avalanche v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Avalanche v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n\n**Polygon v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Polygon v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Optimism v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set sUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Arbitrum v3 Market:**\n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDC.e slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Base v3 Market:** \n\n- Increase USDC slope1 to 5%\n\n**Metis v3 Market:** \n\n- Increase USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Increase USDT slope1 to 5%\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nBlock Analitica is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\nThis proposal is presented on an “as is” basis and without warranty of any kind.
