        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1001\n\n### Summary \nThis is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC Rehype Pool on Gnosis Chain. \n\nRehype Pools hold at least one Aave deposit receipt token and thus allow LPs to receive the lending market yield, in addition to swap fee revenue, and third-party incentives. Rehype Pools build on top of the E-CLP's asymmetric concentrated liquidity profile, improving capital efficiency on two fronts. As per previous arrangements between Balancer and Gnosis this pool shall not bear any protocol fees for the time being.\n\n### References/Useful links\n* [Documentation of Rehype Pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n* \"Savings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\" - [Spark](https://docs.spark.fi/defi-infrastructure/sdai-overview)\n* aUSDC is the deposit receipt token issued by the [Aave](https://aave.com/) protocol to lenders of USDC. Since aTokens are rebasing, this pool uses BGD Labs's [statA wrapper](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3) that is a repricing representation of statA tokens that reflects the accruing lending yield.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\nGyroscope is expanding to Gnosis Chain.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n#### Governance\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n #### Oracles\n n/a\n\n#### Audits\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n#### Centralization vectors\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n\n## Value\nAs per “Motivation”.\n\n---\n\n#### Contracts\n- Rehype pool: [0x045200C6077f105023000D803F3F95B16B187D70](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x045200c6077f105023000d803f3f95b16b187d70)\n- Childchain gauge on Gnosis Chain: [0xFd0D023CeDbb1690e6d602Bc051F06efED8460Dc](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xfd0d023cedbb1690e6d602bc051f06efed8460dc)\n- Gnosis Chain root gauge on Ethereum: [0xc6710f32c9524b4C6736fEae17BE7c88bB8fF87c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6710f32c9524b4C6736fEae17BE7c88bB8fF87c)\n\n---\n\n> Specification\n>\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n> gauge(address): `0xc6710f32c9524b4C6736fEae17BE7c88bB8fF87c`\n> gaugeType(string): `Gnosis`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/693\n\n**Summary:**\n> Balancer's core focus has been yield bearing liquidity for quite some time. As of recent [sDAI](https://app.spark.fi/sdai/) and [sFRAX](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake) have become popular yield bearing stablecoins in the greater defi ecosystem. This proposal is meant to enable four gauges encompassing these tokens on Ethereum and Arbitrum in stable and weighted pools. The pool will sufficiently capture which captures the yield of these tokens and creates routing for the 3 primary stablecoins and wstETH to be swapped against. The pools all will be core for Balancer.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Maker Webiste](https://makerdao.com/en/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/dai/dsr-manager-docs/dsr-manager-docs.md)    \n    • [Communities](https://forum.makerdao.com/)\n> Link to: \n    • [Frax Webiste](https://app.frax.finance/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/src/types/constants.ts)    \n    • [Communities](https://gov.frax.finance/)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sDAI is part of the Maker ecosystem and utilizes the Dai Savings Rate to incentivize users to stake their DAI here https://app.spark.fi/sdai/ . \n>\n>sFRAX is from the new Frax v3 ecosystem and can be utilized [here](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake). \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer users will have a more capital efficient place to provide stable coin liquidity routes. As core pools these will receive BAL incentives over time via the BIP-19 cycle. sDAI and sFRAX will overall earn the DAO more revenue and strengthen the routing for swaps on Balancer using the underlying tokens.  \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module). Frax governance is outlined [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-governance/frax-governance-overview). \n\n2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on the [SavingsDAIRateProvider](https://0xc7177B6E18c1Abd725F5b75792e5F7A3bA5DBC2c) to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/SavingsDAIRateProvider.md). The sFRAX and wstETH oracles utilize the Chainlink feed factory or have been proven by being utilized for over a year on the platform. \n\n3. **Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits). \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n5. **Market History:** sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai). sFRAX history can be seen [here](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xfef79304c80a694dfd9e603d624567d470e1a0e7?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults). \n \n6. **Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin and wstETH liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and sFRAX.\n\nsDAI/3Pool - Mainnet\nPool: [0x49cbD67651fbabCE12d1df18499896ec87BEf46f](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x49cbd67651fbabce12d1df18499896ec87bef46f00000000000000000000064a)\nGauge: [0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4)\n\nsDAI/wstETH - Mainnet\nPool: [0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf1](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf100020000000000000000064b)\nGauge: [0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108)\n\nsFRAX/4POOL - Arbitrum \nPool: [0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27#readContract)\nChild: [0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd)\nRoot: [0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83](https://etherscan.io/address/0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83)\n\nsFRAX/wstETH - Arbitrum\nPool:  [0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f160](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f1600002000000000000000004de)\nChild: [0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653)\nRoot: [0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nThe pool will have the `core pool` status as per BIP-457",

The $PSP token is the governance token of Paraswap DAO. \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> This pool has been the main liquidity of PSP on optimism and recently the Paraswap governance has passed [the proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/paraswap-dao.eth/proposal/0x7c720fc7f9a239115cfe92261074e896266d113a0d0f245808fb690337e4df4e) to further bootstrap PSP liquidity using Aura and Balancer / Beethoven X on Optimism. The BAL gauge would be crucial for this. \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Paraswap governance is through PSP holders. \n \n3. **Audits:**  see [audits](https://www.paraswap.io/#home-audits)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** No. \n\n5. **Market History:** The PSP/OP pool has been established on optimism for more than 7 months. \n \n6. **Value:** The pool is the primary liquidity of PSP on optimism and the BAL gauge would help further bootstrap the liquidity. \n\nPool: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x0244b0025264dc5f5c113d472d579c9c994a59ce0002000000000000000000c9\n\nChild Gauge: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x390E36102245EAc08E5b3D4527b30B3A645F16d7\n\nRoot gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x132296d1Dfd10bA55b565C4Cfe49D350617a2A2b#code\n\nSpecification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x132296d1Dfd10bA55b565C4Cfe49D350617a2A2b`\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",
