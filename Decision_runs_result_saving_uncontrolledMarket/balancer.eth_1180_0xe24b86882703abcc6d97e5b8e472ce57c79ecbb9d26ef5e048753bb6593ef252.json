This is done via reward injectors which take a recipient list schedule that takes mainly the gauge address, amount of rewards per week, and number of weeks. Once an injection is executed; it adds the number of rewards per week to a gauge contract to be streamed to stakers.\n\nDuring the most recent adjustment to the injection schedule for the [ggAVAX/wAVAX pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/avalanche/pool/0xc13546b97b9b1b15372368dc06529d7191081f5b00000000000000000000001d), the GoGoPool team requested to stream 4000 GGP over 4 weeks, at 1000 GGP per week. The transaction (can be seen [here](https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x6b1cf6ebcd19bca140c10a32d8e02d50957f6aae5b76ad1a080fdf621e8318dc?chainId=43114)) executed by the team was incorrectly configured and sent the full amount of 4000 GGP to the injector over a 1 week period which resulted in an undesired outcome for reward distribution.. To compensate the GGP team for this misconfiguration, we propose to supply the difference in incentives of 3000 GGP equivalent in BAL from the treasury at the time of execution.\n\nThis proposal requests Balancer DAO to provide 6545 BAL to be swapped to GGP and be distributed over the next 3 weeks as direct incentives to the ggAVAX/WAVAX gauge as the GoGoPool team intended. In order to facilitate this timeline; the Maxis pooled 1000 GGP to continue the injection cycle this upcoming week to not cause a break in emissions and poor user experience. The request is for a total of 6545 BAL to cover the the total 3000 GGP is to be sent to the LM Multisig for distribution.\n\n**Future Mitigation Measures:**\n\nThe Maxi team was aware of this issue moments after it occurred and attempted to mitigate it by requeuing the recipient list in an effort to correct the misconfiguration prior to the inject sending funds to the gauge. This was done just several minutes late for the firing time, and it was clear to all team members that refining our process around internal communication, transaction loading, and transaction review must all be further improved. Diligence by all parties involved can and will be improved in coming weeks. A combination of tooling, scheduling, automation, and accountability will be pursued to improve everyone on the team’s transaction handling going forward.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call `transfer` on the BAL contract `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d` with the recipient as the LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` amount of 6545 BAL (`6545000000000000000000`).",

        "body": "### Background:\n\nPer [BIP-19](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) Hidden Hand has been providing Balancer DAO an incentives recycling discount of 3%. Hidden Hand’s typical fee placed on voting incentives is 4%, however as Balancer’s core pool incentive structure enshrined Hidden Hand to a degree, their team agreed to returning 3% to the [liquidity mining multisig](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860) `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`. Over time, since these incentives would have technically gone to veBAL holders, the Maxis have been re-injecting the 3% discount as vote incentives for the bootstrapping of liquidity pools when necessary. While not since inception, the Maxis have been tracking the inflow and outflow of these funds from Hidden Hand in this [repository](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/2113b142f183bb2d5f7a00b1f8005a9129b67ef5/MaxiOps/brib_rebate_handling).\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe intention of this proposal is to give permission to the Balancer Maxis to have increased flexibility using the Hidden Hand rebate it receives to benefit the DAO in a plethora of ways. This would include using the tokens received for veBAL incentives, vlAura incentives, direct incentives, and potentially acquiring BAL in the case the DAO ever chooses to build any sort of token position in the governance ecosystem. The primary intention is to place varying voting incentives and direct emissions to be clear; increasing our flexibility in partner onboarding processes.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nDue to the complexity of the veBAL gauge system, as partners are on-boarded into the Balancer ecosystem, 1-3 weeks can go by before a new gauge receives any type of incentives depending on the voting epoch and the network they are deployed on. To decrease the lead time for pools to get from initial bootstrapping to self-sustaining growth the proposed incentives flexibility will have a positive impact. Partners can receive direct incentives sooner than delayed voting incentives. This will not decrease voting incentives in any way, but only bridge the gap between when they are initially placed and when they arrive for LPs to receive.\n\nNo technical specification is required. Simply a change of processes will be considered and reflected in the rebate handling repository linked above.",

More details can be read here: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-whitelist-balancer-s-liquidity-mining-claim/9724. \n\n#### Motivation\n\nstkAAVE cannot be claimed by or through the Balancer vault and can therefore executing this transaction will claim roughly 1520 stkAAVE from a previous liquidity mining campaign from AAVE. AAVE has given the Balancer DAO Multisig the permission to execute this retrieval on behalf of any accrued rewards to the vault. Regardless of what the DAO chooses to do with the retrieved tokens, this first step must be taken before anything further can be done with the tokens mined. \n\n#### Technical Specification\n\nThe DAO Mutlisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the StkAaveRetrieval contract `0x0e2d46fe246eb926d939A10efA96fB7d4EB14bB3` calling `retrieve`.\n\nThis will result in all claimable stkAAVE being claimed to the DAO Multisig.",
