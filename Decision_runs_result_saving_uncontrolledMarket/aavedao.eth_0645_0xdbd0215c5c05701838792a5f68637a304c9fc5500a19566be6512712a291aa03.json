Borrow caps help prevent against high-risk attack vectors while sacrificing little capital efficiency. Our simulation analyses show that these borrow caps for these assets reduce the likelihood of market manipulation while allowing for natural organic borrow demand. As these markets naturally grow, we can continue to reassess raising caps incrementally.  \n\n- FRAX borrow_cap: 2,000,000\n- MAI borrow_cap: 2,000,000\n- LINK borrow_cap: 220,000\n\n## Specification\n\nSet borrow caps on FRAX, MAI, and LINK on Aave V3 AVAX.\n\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. \n\nIn addition, this ARC proposes adjusting two (2) total risk parameters, including LTV and Liquidation Threshold, across one (1) Aave Arc (Fireblocks) asset.\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Following the recent market crash, our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for LINK and WETH.** \n\nThese parameter updates also represent Gauntlet's first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HQ5c5T0.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Sr4q4Mh.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/I90tK6y.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top LINK non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zx0G68o.png)\n\n**Top WBTC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yAclipo.png)\n\n**Top WETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/r7KX1HS.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nOur recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. \n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| LINK Loan To Value     | 70%     | 67%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 5.0%     |\n| **LINK Liquidation Threshold**     | 78%     | ***75%***     |\n| WBTC Loan To Value     | 70%     | 69%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 76%     |\n| WETH Loan To Value     | 82.5%     | 81%     |\n| WETH Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |\n| **WETH Liquidation Threshold**     | 85%     | ***83%***     |\n\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 05/13 to 05/26. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 05-26 Volatility| 05-13 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| LINK   | \t  1.560317105       |  1.407103695  | \t0.15321341   |  -67.2106437    |\n| WBTC    |  \t0.855923268     |   0.823403106    | \t0.032520162    |  -64.0842057 |\n| WETH    |   0.90963415     |  0.832421096      | 0.077213054  |  \t-69.59337  |\n\n## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification\n\nOur simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| USDC Loan To Value     | 85.5%     | 87.5%     |\n| USDC Liquidation Threshold     | 88%     | 90%     |\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vdil33O.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-05-31\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

        "body": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. \n\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zW3mXLO.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6AnD7kE.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L5VsbrR.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top CRV non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8RwGtti.png)\n\n**Top DAI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xo6pCby.png)\n\n**Top ENJ non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3SOtHAm.png)\n\n**Top LINK non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5wxtQRV.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 65%     | ***64%***     |\n| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 80%     | 85%     |\n| DAI Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |\n| **ENJ Liquidation Threshold**     | 70%     | ***67%***     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 6.0%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Threshold     | 78%     | 83%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 7.0%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 07/01 to 08/03. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 08-03 Volatility| 07-01 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| CRV   | \t  1.47619713      |  1.778618025  | \t\t-0.302420895   |  77.315888   |\n| DAI    |  \t0.039068386     |   0.259962179   | \t-0.220893793    |  -50.4644256 |\n| ENJ    |   1.148617699     |  1.452206402      | -0.303588703|  \t25.9940047  |\n| LINK    |   0.910394357     |  1.650882468      | -0.740488111  |  \t23.1053197  |\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 8/3/2022, the data shows that no accounts would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on the forum post.\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KkfStOO.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-08-09\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

        "author": "0x5772ACba5A09bB032f90AC7b15fE11D40CCC4314",
        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\n\nA proposal to adjust one (1) total risk parameter - Supply Cap - across one (1) Aave V3 Optimism asset.\n\nThis should reduce risk in the protocol, though it does limit the growth of AAVE deposits on Optimism.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThere is currently not a supply cap for the AAVE asset on Aave's v3 deployment on Optimism. We are going to set this quickly and provide a deeper analysis of all of the current supply caps next week. We believe these could be more conservative, but setting a supply cap for AAVE sooner rather than later will reduce the chance of new positions creating a dangerous spike in VaR. \n\nBeyond this, the cap greatly reduces the viability of market downturn and price manipulation attacks involving the AAVE token.\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nAny market without supply caps could experience an outsize risk by someone opening a very large position quickly. Maintaining supply caps that ensure that one user cannot subject the protocol to outsize risk is a key part of risk management for Aave v3 markets. \n\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. This change was driven by analysis focusing on insolvency, as estimated by our simulations. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). The input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aavev3_optimism) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n\n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V3 Optimism\n\n\n\n**Top 10 borrowers’ aggregate positions**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dB6Nnhi.png)\n\n\n**Top 10 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EEAsgKS.png)\n\n\n**Top 10 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HGx24EU.png)\n\n\n\n## Aave V3 Optimism Parameter Changes Specification\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value | Current AAVE Supply | \n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -----|\n| AAVE Supply Cap  | None | 100,000   | 87,980 |\n\n#### Why would we limit the AAVE supply?\n\nThere's limited AAVE liquidity on [Optimism on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/optimism/tokens/0x76fb31fb4af56892a25e32cfc43de717950c9278), with $121k AAVE/ETH being the largest AAVE pool. The current AAVE supply on Optimism Aave v3 is $4.7M, so a liquidator will not be able to arbitrage a large AAVE position solely on Optimism DEXs. However, the liquidation bonus at 10% is high enough that we anticipate liquidators should be willing to hold or bridge AAVE. As the markets on Optimism grow, AAVE will rely more and more on the asset bridge and available cross-chain liquidity. This is why we mentioned that all of these caps could be more conservative, and look forward to sharing more info there next week. If the Aave community wants to take a conservative stance on risk, we should consider lowering these across the board.\n\n#### Aave Token Balances Since Oct 30th \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oBCwFcc.png)\n\n------------------------------\n------------------------------\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Initiate Snapshot vote immediately since the community has recently weighed in on changes of this nature. \n* Targeting an AIP on [2023-01-02]\n\n## Quick Links\n[Analytics Dashboard](https://metabase.gauntlet.network/public/dashboard/f4930651-29be-4ff3-b664-a34462e286c5)\n[Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aavev3_optimism)\n[Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc)\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) \n\n## Notes \n\nThese parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations.
