A key protocol innovation is lpETH, a yield-bearing ETH receipt token that captures revenue from Loop’s lending activities and is collateralized by a diversified index of LRTs. slpETH is the staked form of lpETH which will receive protocol revenue and has a 7 day withdrawal period. This Balancer Pool will bypass this 7 day period by allowing people to sell slpETH directly.\n\nWhen users deposit ETH into Loop, they receive lpETH which can be:\n\n> 1. Staked to earn lending yields\n> 2. Locked in dLP (Loop’s governance token based on Balancers ve80/20 model)\n> 3.

Our protocol plans to integrate Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs) as supported collateral, creating a synergistic relationship where veBAL voting rights will be used to direct liquidity incentives toward these integrated pools. This strategy serves multiple purposes:\n  1. Ensures sustainable liquidity for lpETH-WETH and future Loop-related pools\n  2. Creates additional yield opportunities for Loop users through BPT collateralization\n  3. Demonstrates long-term commitment to the Balancer ecosystem\n  4.

Like other ETH LSTs, orbETH increases in value as it generates ETH staking yield through apxETH on Ethereum mainnet, allowing users to seamlessly earn staking rewards.\n\norbETH can be minted natively on Arbitrum One and other orbit chains with ETH and can be easily bridged across orbit chains, ensuring smooth cross-chain interoperability and utility. When orbETH is minted, ETH is deposited into the Dinero Protocol for apxETH. Since orbETH is backed by apxETH, it directly benefits from apxETH’s above-market ETH staking yield.\n\nThe vision for orbETH is to become the go-to ETH asset for Arbitrum Orbit—so widely integrated and adopted that it surpasses even WETH in usage. As one of the first native Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem applications, orbETH aims to unify the ecosystem, enhancing liquidity, expanding utility, and fostering greater cohesion among protocols.\n\nBy integrating orbETH across the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem, protocols, builders, and users benefit from access to native ETH staking yield, while the Arbitrum Foundation earns a share of orbETH's yield—creating a sustainable revenue stream to support network growth. This can be redistributed to protocols and users supporting orbETH.\n\nThe long term goals of orbETH are to promote orbETH and Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem success through increased liquidity, adoption, and integration of LSTs across the ecosystem.\n\norbETH can be redeemed for pxETH or ETH by unstaking on the Beacon Chain. However, for orbETH to become a cornerstone asset across the Arbitrum Orbit ecosystem, it needs deep, instant liquidity. In the first instance, bootstrapping orbETH liquidity through key orbETH liquidity pairs is crucial for ingraining orbETH as a core asset in the ecosystem.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Dinero has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Dinero’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the primary venue for crucial orbETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for orbETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Dinero plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial orbETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nDinero’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/redactedcartel.eth). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://dineroismoney.com/docs/security).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe orbETH/waArbWETH has just been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged.\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Dinero plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial orbETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n### Technical Specifications\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments: gauge(address):`0x2D1c51eaB8b3c2287BA26061c0e339DA3b15B955` \ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nEdit Maxis:\n* Tech spec\n* PR with Payload",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/519\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? No\n> 3. **Audits:** [Audits](https://docs.overnight.fi/advanced/audits)\n> * [Hacken Audit (Feb 3, 2022) - App](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-app/blob/master/audits/hacken_2022-02-03.pdf)\n> * [Hacken Audit (Feb 3, 2022) - Core](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-core/blob/master/audits/hacken_2022-02-03.pdf)\n> * [Ackee Audit (Mar 3, 2023)](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-core/blob/master/audits/ackee_2023-03-03.pdf)\n>\n> 4. **Market History:**\n> Overnight Pulse on Beethoven [Beethoven X | Overnight Pulse ](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0xb1c9ac57594e9b1ec0f3787d9f6744ef4cb0a02400000000000000000000006e)\n> Overnight Pulse on Balancer Arbitrum [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x519cce718fcd11ac09194cff4517f12d263be067000000000000000000000382)\n>\n> 5. **Value:** The pool is expected to generate trading volumes and fees for Balancer.The proposed OVN/wUSD+ pool aims to be a primary source of liquidity for both tokens, enhancing the stability and depth of the market on Balancer.
