This compensation allows them to focus on aave and keep their contribution efforts to our governance. The ACI proposes the extension of Orbit for a new quarter, Q3 2024, from 2024-05-13 to 2024-08-30.\n\n**Gas Rebate**:\n\nInitially meant to reimburse gas cost associated with governance voting, the gas rebate has been entirely focused on service provider gas reimbursement since the launch of Aave governance V3, we propose to segregate these payments after this proposal to keep focus and consistency in the Orbit program.\n\nGas reimbursements from service providers activity are proposed to be managed by Aave Finance service providers in their monthly treasury management update.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Period Coverage: Blocks 19860032 (May 13th 2024) to Block 20639896 (August 30th 2024)**\n\nEligible Platforms:\nEzR3al\nStableNode\nSaucy Block\nAreta\n\nGas Rebate: Last service provider gas rebate using orbit:\nACI : 2.91 ETH\nCatapulta: 0.67 ETH\nTokenLogic: 0.72 ETH\nBudget: 60000 GHO and 4.3 ETH\n\n## Relevant Links\n\n[Script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V3-August-2024-script-Output-55c7ee78d48a4126a295f74a0dbf883c)\n[ACI’s Orbit tracker](https://dapps.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker)\n\n## Next Steps\nGather community feedback on this ARFC.\nIf consensus is achieved, escalate this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury management AIPs.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is independent and has not received any form of compensation from related parties for the drafting of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

Compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs.\n\nThis innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program, However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, the proposal suggests maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions. These tasks are now streamlined under the ACI's Dolce Vita product, offering a focused and efficient mechanism to manage and reimburse the gas expenditures associated with governance contributions.\n\nTo accurately track and reimburse gas expenditures, the proposal leverages [open-source scripts](https://github.com/JosepBove/aave-gov-gas) initially developed by Josep Bove, now part of the ACI team. These scripts have been [adapted for compatibility with Governance V3](https://github.com/AaveChan/aave-gov3-gas/tree/master), ensuring transparency and accountability in monitoring gas costs incurred by delegates during their governance activities.\n\nMoreover, the proposal introduces the [Orbit Tracker app](https://www.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker), which was developed by Martin, a new front-end engineer at ACI. This tool provides a comprehensive overview of recognized delegates, detailing their voting power and participation rates, thus enhancing the visibility of delegate contributions and engagement within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidaq56t2akvacel6xwg6kasz3ktw3f7lck3ysvn7xodfxbpnp5wju)\n    \n\nThe eligibility criteria for Orbit renewal emphasize participation rate, power, and platform maturity, ensuring that only the most dedicated and impactful delegates are compensated. These criteria are designed to balance the quality of governance participation with the cost-effectiveness of the Orbit program.\n\nTo define eligibility for renewal of Orbit, we propose the following requirements:\n\n- Not an Aave Service Provider\n- Minimum 20k voting power\n- Minimum 70% participation rate\n- Minimum 120 days since delegate platform creation\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed compensation for eligible delegates matching the requirements:\n\n|Delegate Platform|Retro-Payment (GHO)|New Stream (GHO)|Total Cost (GHO)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|EzR3al|5000|15000|20000|\n|Stable Labs|5000|15000|20000|\n|LBS Blockchain|5000|15000|20000|\n|Michigan|5000|15000|20000|\n|Total|20000|60000|80000|\n\nIn terms of gas rebate, we included Gov V2 reimbursement & payload-related activity in the following table:\n\n|Delegate / Service Provider | Gas Used (ETH)|\n|--- | ---|\n|ACI | 3.365|\n|Tokenlogic | 0.586|\n|Michigan | 0.276|\n|Wintermute | 0.2518|\n|LBS | 0.031|\n|StableLabs | 0.0342|\n|ezr3al | 0.3833|\n|**Total** | **4.9273**|\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n - [Orbit tracker app](https://www.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker) \n - Gov V2 [script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V2-Gas-rebate-Feb-2024-Script-output-e7df604934434435849f71b4105a9d43?pvs=4)\n- Gov V3 [script output](https://www.notion.so/aavechan/Gov-V3-Payload-Script-output-cee4e7ce8b7048b58ec874a4b1499aa3)\n- Gov V2 [script code](https://github.com/JosepBove/aave-gov-gas)\n- Gov V3 [script code](https://github.com/AaveChan/aave-gov3-gas/tree/master)\n\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Period Coverage:** Blocks 18040579 (Sep 1st 2023) to 19162696 (5th feb 2024)\n- **Eligibility Criteria:** Non-Aave Service Providers, minimum 20k voting power, 70% participation rate, and 120 days since platform creation.\n- **Budget:** 80000 GHO and 4.6755 ETH\n\n## Next Steps\n1.

        "body": "---\n\n### Title: [ARFC] Expansion of \"Orbit\" - A DAO Funded Delegate Platform Initiative\n### Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n### Date: 2023-09-07\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis ARFC proposes the expansion of the [\"Orbit\" delegate platform initiative](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241), transitioning it from being funded by the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) to being funded by the Aave DAO. The goal is to enhance the sustainability and independence of the program, ensuring continued support for active delegates in the Aave community.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe pilot phase of Orbit, funded by ACI, has been a success in its first quarter. Recognizing its positive impact, there's a need to expand and generalize the program, ensuring its longevity and alignment with the broader Aave community goals.\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe proposed funding for the Orbit initiative remains at $5,000 per month, with payments to be made in GHO stablecoin. Orbit operates on a quarterly basis, with eligibility criteria defined for each quarter.\n\nFor the upcoming quarter, the eligibility criteria will mirror that of the [[ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680). In subsequent quarters, a threshold of voting power and diversity of delegation will be introduced to ensure the program's integrity and to prevent potential abuse. To fund the Orbit initiative, stablecoins from the Aave DAO treasury will be used to purchase GHO on secondary markets, which is expected to have a minor positive effect on the GHO peg.\n\n### Eligible Delegates:\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Participation Rate |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 100.0% |\n| ACI | 0x329c54289ff5d6b7b7dae13592c6b1eda1543ed4 | 94.67% |\n| Wintermute | 0xb933aee47c438f22de0747d57fc239fe37878dd1 | 93.33% |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 93.33% |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 86.67% |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 78.67% |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 73.33% |\n| NewTokenLogic | 0x2cc1ade245020fc5aae66ad443e1f66e01c54df1 | 32.0%* |\n\n*Note: Tokenlogic transitioned from an old to a new delegate address during last quarter, their cumulative score considering both addresses is matching other delegates scores*\n\n### Recipient Delegates\n\nhere's the list of delegates accepting participation in Orbit. for the next quarter\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Budget |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 15.000 GHO |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 15.000 GHO |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 15.000 GHO |\n|**Total Budget** | **75.000 GHO**|\n\n### Implementation:\n\nIf this ARFC gets governance support, the implementation will consolidate some Aave DAO treasury stablecoin holdings to acquire GHO on secondary markets. Subsequently, a new set of streams of 15,000 GHO will be created to the eligible delegates' addresses for a period of 90 days.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1.

        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] TokenLogic Hohmann Transfer\nauthor: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\ncreated: 2023-10-05\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC proposes the inclusion of TokenLogic in the \"Orbit\" delegate platform initiative for a period of 90 days, with a monthly compensation of 5k GHO and total budget of 15k GHO.\n\n## Motivation\nTokenLogic has been an active and valuable participant in the Aave ecosystem. While they were initially eligible and considered for the Orbit program, they opted to explore the possibility of becoming a service provider to the DAO. However, given their recent decision to re-organize internally and re-evaluate their proposed scope as a service provider, it's appropriate to reconsider their inclusion in the Orbit program.\n\n## Specification\n\n### TokenLogic Inclusion\n\n- TokenLogic will be recognized as an official delegate within the Orbit program for a period of 90 days.\n- They will receive a monthly compensation of 5k GHO, totaling 15k GHO over the three-month period.\n\n### Funding and Emissions\n\nTokenLogic's compensation will be in line with the Orbit program's guidelines, ensuring fairness and consistency with other delegates.\n\n### Responsibilities and Conditions\n\n- TokenLogic will actively participate in Aave governance, representing their delegators and contributing to the protocol's growth.\n- If TokenLogic presents and successfully passes a proposal to become a service provider to the DAO, their Orbit funding stream will be terminated to prevent double compensation.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The inclusion of TokenLogic is based on their merits and contributions to the Aave community.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
