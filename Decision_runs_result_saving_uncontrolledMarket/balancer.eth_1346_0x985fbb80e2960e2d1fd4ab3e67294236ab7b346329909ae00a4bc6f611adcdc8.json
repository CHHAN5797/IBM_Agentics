This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n```\n• Website - https://www.ether.fi/\n• Documentation - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper\n• Github Page - https://github.com/etherfi-protocol\n• Discord - https://discord.com/invite/zqGzcuQWvD\n• Twitter - https://twitter.com/ether_fi\n```\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the ether.fi liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on ether.fi automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. \n\nThe eETH contract has been live since June 2023, with eETH launching to the open market on November 15th, 2023, and has approx. 515k ETH held within it. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nether.fi is looking to seed a weETH/rETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for weETH on Arbitrum. Incentivising a Balancer pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Arbitrum. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the L2 DeFi ecosystem. \n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed ether.fi executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token.\n\n2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the ether.fi team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however as the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.\n\n* The exchange rate feed for weETH-ETH on Arbitrum has been deployed by Chainlink. \n\n3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the ether.fi protocol are found on the GitBook page - [Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at ether.fi, however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the ether.fi DAO and governance.\n\n5. **Market History:** - eETH was first deployed November 15, 2023. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the ether.fi Dune dashboard - https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi\n\n6. **Value:** - The weETH/rETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum. The pairing of eETH with rETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.\n\nweETH on Arbitrum: 0x35751007a407ca6FEFfE80b3cB397736D2cf4dbe\n\nweETH/rETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x4b3af34eb1135d59df8b9cdc2ff07d30d05334c400000000000000000000050d\n\nChild chain gauge [0x8C206459a557aA736F698401BD6029fC0Db3f3c8](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8C206459a557aA736F698401BD6029fC0Db3f3c8#code) — mainnet root: [0xB5dCdE9aDCace88705658Aa276C557afC011FE55]\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xB5dCdE9aDCace88705658Aa276C557afC011FE55`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "title": "[BIP-507] Enable weETH/rETH Gauge w/ 10% Cap [Ethereum]",
        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/683\n\n**Summary:**\nThe [ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/) team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-rETH pool on Ethereum mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap. The goal is to move from the current weETH-WETH pool to this one over time because of the 100% yield bearing nature in the new pairing. The proposal below is based on the original proposal of [BIP-492](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-492-enable-weeth-weth-gauge-ethereum/5353).\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Currently when users wish to restake their LST’s they lock their tokens, which breaks composability in DeFi. Staking with eETH on [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. No other liquid staking protocol has this capability.\n\nThe eETH contract has been live since June 2023 and has approx. 10,000 ETH held within in - this ETH was accumulated before eETH was officially launched and available for end users to hold directly. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is looking to seed a weETH/rETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for eETH. Incentivising a Balancer pool could significantly boost the liquidity of the LRT. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the DeFi ecosystem. To ensure success, [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is committed to enhancing the value of the veBAL ecosystem by promoting pool liquidity through Hidden Hand voting incentives\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token in approx. 3-6 months.\n2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee. \n- The rate provder for weETH is the same contract as the token and has been reviewed by the integrations team. It was deemed SAFE [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/WeETH.md). \n3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol are found on the GitBook page - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits. The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/), however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) DAO and governance.\n5. **Market History:** eETH is a brand new Liquid restaking token, therefore there is not much in the way of market history as Balancer will serve as the first pool to support wrapped eETH.\nweETH/rETH pool on Balancer: [0x05ff47AFADa98a98982113758878F9A8B9FddA0a](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x05ff47afada98a98982113758878f9a8b9fdda0a000000000000000000000645)\nGauge: [0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF)\n6. **Value:** - The weETH/rETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token. The pairing of eETH with rETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers. \n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/WETH 50/50 pool] on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n**Oracles:**\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\n**Audits:**\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pd)\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting,\n\nOvertime, our goal is to migrate Renzo to utilize decentralized infrastructure.\n\n**Market History:**\nFrom 0 to 100, Renzo launched on EigenLayer Mainnet 1-month ago and has witnessed explosive growth. TVL is nearing +$90M USD, with +33k ETH restaked, and over +4,500 unique depositors.\n\nRenzo’s remarkable growth and strong community backing underscore its prominence servicing users with liquid restaking on EigenLayer. The ezETH/WETH pool on Balancer will mark its inaugural support on a DEX.\n \n \n![veBAL gauge.png](ipfs://bafkreihp6ndnucaokydajbmb5dma6skebx4wffdbcmfotxyrjzrxpf5zaa)\n    \n\n**Value:**\n\nRenzo recently closed a successful seed round in December 2023, raising $3.2 million in equity with a 1:1 Token Warrant. The post-round valuation stands at an impressive $25 million, showcasing strong support for Renzo’s innovative liquid restaking protocol.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2’s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects. \n\nAbove all, Renzo is committed to building the most successful liquid restaking ecosystem on EigenLayer, delivering rewarding experiences for all restakers and holders of ezETH.\n\n- [Add Pool Gauge Info] https://etherscan.io/address/0xa8B309a75f0D64ED632d45A003c68A30e59A1D8b\n- Rate Provider Review https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/4/files\n- The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n- gauge(address):0xa8B309a75f0D64ED632d45A003c68A30e59A1D8b\n- gaugeType(string): Ethereum\n\nAdditionally, this pool is requesting core pool status as per BIP-457",
