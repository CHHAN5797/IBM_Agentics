        "body": "This Snapshot vote aims to solicit a temperature check from the ArbitrumDAO on their stance for bringing the BoLD upgrade to Arbitrum One and Nova. BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains and enhances their security by mitigating the risk of delay attacks.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the original [BoLD AIP Forum Post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) where you will find public audit reports, the BoLD whitepaper (that contain the formal specification and safety proofs), as well as further explanations of how BoLD works (including an overview of BoLD’s economics, spam prevention, rewards, reimbursements and penalties) and its proposed design for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\n## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis Constitutional AIP proposes upgrading Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova’s Rollup Contracts to use Arbitrum BoLD and to support a new challenger manager contract on Ethereum. Arbitrum BoLD is a new dispute resolution protocol that’s designed to replace the existing and currently deployed Arbitrum protocol. If the upgrade is approved, then validators on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova can use the Nitro software to participate in BoLD. BoLD delivers two critical improvements:\n- Unlocks permissionless validation for Arbitrum chains,\n- Enhances the security of Arbitrum chains by mitigating the risk of [delay attacks](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/solutions-to-delay-attacks-on-rollups-434f9d05a07a).\n\nBoLD accomplishes this feat by ensuring that any single honest party can always successfully defend against malicious claims to an Arbitrum chain’s state. BoLD represents the next step on the journey to having the Arbitrum technology stack being recognized as a [Stage 2 Ethereum rollup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571). The implementation of BoLD will be thoroughly tested to ensure both its effectiveness and safety. The testing plan includes:\n- A comprehensive [audit by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf),\n- Deployment of the protocol to public testnets for at least 8 weeks,\n- A public [audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold),\n- [Publication of mathematical safety proofs and formal specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO should consider approving this AIP as BoLD delivers critical security and decentralization improvements for Arbitrum One and Nova that benefit all Arbitrum users, Arbitrum node operators, dApps on Arbitrum, and Arbitrum bridges. These benefits can be extended to any Orbit chain that wishes to adopt BoLD.\n\nMore specifically, this new dispute resolution protocol brings the following benefits to Arbitrum chains:\n- Permissionless validation\n- Fixed delay time for assertion confirmation\n- Security Council Safety-First Approach\n\nMore details on these benefits can be found in the [Motivation section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#motivation-2).\n\n## Rationale\n\nEnabling permissionless validation has been a long-term goal of Arbitrum on the [progressive journey towards decentralization](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/state-of-progressive-decentralization).\n\nBoLD mitigates the risk of delay attacks on Optimistic Rollups by ensuring challenges can be resolved within a fixed time period as long as there is an honest party involved. This particular change unlocks permissionless validation, enabling any well-resourced honest party or parties to defend and protect Arbitrum from malicious actors.\n\nMore details on the community values that this proposal supports, can be found in the [Rationale section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#rationale-3).\n\n## Implementation, Formal Specification, and Safety Proofs\n\nThe following link, [BoLD Implementation Deep Dive](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/TechnicalDeepDive.pdf), explains how BoLD is implemented and how it works at a high level. To read about the formal specifications and mathematical safety proofs for the protocol, check out the [official BoLD whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10491).\n\n## Economics of Disputes, including the cost to participate, rewards, and penalties\n\nThe economics behind BoLD are carefully researched and designed to optimize for the security of the protocol while keeping costs reasonable for honest parties. More details on this topic can be found in the [Economics section of the original proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#overview-of-bolds-economics-and-spam-prevention-5) and this short paper on the [Economics of Disputes in BoLD](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/Economics.pdf). \n\n## Technical Risks\n\nSome of the technical risks of the BoLD upgrade include:\n- Issues preventing liveness of challenges due to smart contract bugs in the new contracts. For instance, no honest validator able to make a move when it should be able to;\n- Safety issues where a malicious party is able to game the system and win due to logic errors in smart contracts;\n- Logic bugs in the assertion smart contracts that could affect assertion confirmation and posting, which could delay withdrawals until it is fixed; and\n- Bugs in bonding logic in the smart contracts that could lead to loss of funds due to logic errors in the Arbitrum Rollup and challenge manager smart contracts.\n\nRisks that remain the same between the current Arbitrum Rollup protocol and BoLD:\n- Bugs in the one step proof logic: BoLD does not change how one step proofs work for Arbitrum chains.\n\n## Timeline and steps to implement BoLD for Arbitrum One and Nova\n\nBelow is a list of initiatives to ensure the new BoLD dispute resolution protocol is ready to be reviewed and voted on by the ArbitrumDAO for adoption in Arbitrum One and Nova. Feedback from the community and any findings from testing will be collected and used to inform decisions and evolve BoLD along the way.\n\n1. Deployment of a public testnet with BoLD validators for a minimum of 4 weeks\n  a. Check out this guide on [how to deploy a BoLD validator on the testnet](https://github.com/offchainlabs/bold-validator-starter-kit) to begin testing out permissionless validation using Arbitrum technology!\n2. The submission of the AIP in the format of a [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232).\n3. [Audit of the protocol’s implementation by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-04-offchainbold-securityreview.pdf)\n4. Hosting of governance calls to talk about BoLD to answer questions from the community about BoLD and this AIP.\n5. This formal temperature check proposal to activate BoLD on Arbitrum’s Sepolia for a minimum of 4 weeks, be made via a Snapshot vote.\n6. Kick-start a [public audit program](https://code4rena.com/audits/2024-05-arbitrum-bold).\n7. Finalize pre-mainnet requirements, including:\n  a. Publication of BoLD migration documentation for existing validators;\n  b. Deployment of a monitoring stack to view on-going challenges on an Arbitrum chain; and\n  c. Publication of a formal procedure for The Arbitrum Foundation to handle L1 gas costs reimbursements for honest parties.\n8. Formal AIP gets submitted to Tally.\n9. Should the formal on-chain proposal pass, BoLD will activate on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no cost for this proposal to the ArbitrumDAO as Offchain Labs, Inc. will incur all engineering and audit costs to complete the implementation of BoLD and get this new dispute resolution protocol into a mainnet-ready state. Currently, future development work for BoLD is expected to also be undertaken by Offchain Labs, Inc.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe confirmation timing on any withdrawal that is in-flight when the proposed BoLD upgrade is activated will be delayed until the first BoLD assertion is confirmed. This means that for any Arbitrum chain that upgrades to use BoLD, including Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, all pending withdrawals to L1 Ethereum that were initiated before the upgrade will be delayed by 1 challenge period, plus the time between the withdrawal was initiated and the time that the BoLD upgrade takes place. This is because the upgrade effectively “resets” the challenge period for that are not yet finalized.\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor additional topics & questions, please visit the BoLD specific FAQ document [here](https://www.notion.so/arbitrumfoundation/Arbitrum-BoLD-FAQ-93210f430a6a470792496be040ac9990).",

        "body": "## **Abstract**\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal represents an improved version compared to previous initiatives and requests for comments (RFCs):\n\n- [[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-2-delegate-incentive-system-for-arbitrumdao/15720)\n- [[DRAFT] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/16501)\n\nWe have developed this new proposal considering the comments and observations provided by other delegates. Our additional motivation lies in the recent increase in proposals and increased activity within ArbitrumDAO. We believe that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes.\n\n# **Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## **Before reading the proposal, note how we have decided to structure it**\n\nThis proposal is structured into four main sections:\n\n* **Option 1:** This is our main proposal detailing all the specifications of the incentive system.\n* **Option 2:** Introduces the implementation of \"Karma\" to automate certain processes. It's important to note that this option entails additional costs.\n* **General Summary:** An overview of the proposed items.\n* **Next Steps:** Voting deadline\n\n# **Option 1 - Main Proposal**\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number at **50 delegates**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a reasonable starting point.\n\n## Funding\n\n- Incentives for delegates: 1,500,000 ARB\n- Incentive Program Administrator: 25,000 ARB\n\n## Delegate Selection Process\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\n> * So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\n> * The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\n> * Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:\n> 1. [Core Test Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/60371879178081104082641012273221287927865067413661362234634146098631763379427)\n> 2.

[[OLD] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 7-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\n> * Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid on a monthly basis, we will use a point system and a framework that will be made public.\n\n![scores.png](ipfs://bafybeieuu4yypwmkapdkznz4arvsci7t7ond4a7qh55us2fuz5ijjbhwsa)\n    \n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. This parameter is extracted from Tally. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR * 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Tn) /SV(Fn)) * 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Fn) - TV(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Fn) - CR(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Fn) - CP(Rn)) * 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 * TP% / 100))**\n\n#### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n- Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n- Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n- Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n- Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n- Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no? \n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Delegate Responsibilities\n\nDelegates are responsible for keeping track of their actions. At the end of the month, they have until the 3rd of the following month to submit a forum post with the following requirements:\n\n* A copy (Link) of the framework with their activity data for that month.\n* Additionally, the post must have a summary with all the links including:\n  * Snapshot voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the reasoning behind the snapshot vote\n  * Tally voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the tally vote reasoning (if you have changed your vote)\n  * Commenting on Proposals link (only those that went to snapshots)\n* The summary should also include:\n  * Delegate proposal links\n  * Links to any significant contribution (discussion, questions, suggestions, etc.) made to a proposal.\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Delegates failing to post the requested information will not receive incentives.\n> * To avoid forum spam and disarray, we will ask the facilitators to add a channel for the incentive system so delegates can input all their information there.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nAfter the delegates post and present their results in the framework, the incentive system administrator has 10 days to gather all the information, review, verify, and unify it. Then, present all the unified data on the forum in the [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862) and attach a summary explaining that month's final result.\n\nOnce the final result is presented, delegates have 2 days to file a claim in case of disagreement.\n\n#### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success. \n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be sent as a proposal to Tally, with full details of the payments, between the 16th and 17th. This will be repeated for the 6 months, so that the DAO has control over the incentive program and can cut it off whenever it wants.\n\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\nEstimated schedule:\n\n![schedule.png](ipfs://bafkreie7nlxyh7jx7myxgfj6eqogu6p7kfebmokq3v5fvxzskmmb7j2h64)\n    \n### Administrator Perspective\n\n1. Start of the month: Track delegate participation in governance.\n2. Last day of the month: Begin collecting delegate posts from the forum.\n3. Review all the information, check for accuracy, and compile it into the framework.\n4. Establish the results within the given timeframe.\n5. If everyone agrees, send a proposal to Tally with the payment details, to be voted on.\n6. Keep the DAO informed\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the adminstration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the adminstration of said program the budget would be 25,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator.\n\n---\n\n# **Option 2 - Karma automation for delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n**Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n- **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n- **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n- **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n- **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n- **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n- **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n### Cost\n\n- 30000 ARB\n\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nAs with Option 1, we are also open to having a group of delegates or potentially a third party administer Karma's progress and the program, in which case we would obviously provide all necessary assistance.\n\nFor the administration of the program for this option the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator. \n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\nProposal overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## CONT IN FORUM POST",

        "body": "## Non-Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is seeking 900 ETH, made up of:\n- **Service fees**. 500 ETH to pay proposers who are actively participating and advancing the chain.\n- **Refund L1 gas costs**. 400 ETH to reimburse all L1 gas costs for proposers who are actively advancing the chain and defending against malicious challenges, assuming 1 challenge per year.\n\nThis proposal is contingent on the AIP [upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD doesn’t pass - the Arbitrum Foundation will return these funds, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD only proposes the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet introduce an economic incentive mechanism to grow the validator set (since Arbitrum only needs 1 honest, active proposer at any point in time). Without this incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. There can only be 1 “active” proposer at any point.\n- **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state.\n- **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n- **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n- **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n- **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n- **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Service Fees for BoLD Validators\n\nAll blockchains, including Arbitrum One, should compensate participants who actively work to progress the chain.\n\nFor Arbitrum One, the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) proposes that the DAO pay a service fee to an active proposer who is advancing the chain by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet, which at the time of writing is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH per year ([Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr)). \n\nNOTE: This payment is a fee and not a reward. In both the currently deployed protocol and in BoLD, a new assertion is posted every hour and only the time that the proposer is considered actively bonded will be used to determine the fee amount. Additionally, proposers are only eligible for this fee when their assertion is confirmed. There can be multiple actors who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1 (i.e. active).\n\nWe estimate the following service fee per year:\n- Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer (at this assumed rate).\n\nThe Foundation therefore requests 500 ETH to support service fee payments for up to 3 years (144*3 years plus a buffer of 68 ETH) in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. \n\nTo learn more about service fees, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7).\n\nNote: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee since the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to use the ArbitrumDAO’s funds.\n\n### Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain. It is estimated that 400 ETH will be sufficient to cover ~3 years of operational costs.\n\nThere are two on-chain gas costs:\n- **Posting assertions**. An active proposer must post an assertion for the chain to advance.\n- **Challenges**. A proposer who is defending the system must participate in a multi-round challenge process.\n\nNote: we only propose to reimburse L1 gas costs since that is publicly verifiable and computable by all. The off-chain costs to run a proposer will not be reimbursed.\n\n#### Estimated Reimbursement Costs\n\nAssuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party’s gas costs the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.\n\nThis includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.\n\nTo learn more about these calculations, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-funds-to-bootstrap-the-first-bold-validator/24506#reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7).\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until these is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 900 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 500 ETH as service fees for active BoLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,\n- 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.\n\nNotable points:\n- Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,\n- Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,\n- All service fee payments and L1 gas reimbursements for non-Arbitrum Foundation actors will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation periodically alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation’s compliance process.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**. The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).",

        "body": "**Changes Based on Feedback Since the Temperature Check Version (posted 20th Oct)**\n\n- For simplicity and security reasons, decided to forego the token mint aspect of the proposal entirely and fund staking with a treasury request instead. Using the mint to fund staking was deemed too circular and not a necessary step based on feedback.\n- Added the idea of the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ as a potential key partner to gather data and monitor the impacts of this staking mechanism over the next 12 months with the end goal of using these insights to refine the ARB staking mechanism further. This collaboration is reliant on the Arbitrum Coalition’s conditional funding.\n- Added an additional 1.25% voting option\n- Clarified that voting will be ranked choice voting with five different options\n\n**Changes Based on Feedback Since the RFC Version**\n\n- Added several options for voting - 1.75%, 1.5%, and 1%. Examples of APRs at different ARB staking percentages can be found later in the proposal.\n- The maximum lock penalty % has been changed from 80% to 60%.\n- Suggested that the implementation details (selecting a vendor and auditor) will be decided in a further proposal\n\n# Abstract\nThe Arbitrum DAO treasury is growing rapidly, yet that growth is not currently being shared with token holders. The Arbitrum DAO treasury address holds 3,54B ARB tokens, and an unexpected $69,4M of unclaimed individual ARB airdrops were recently returned to the DAO treasury. The treasury is exceptionally well funded, and it’s important to note that the DAO fully controls the usage of the Arbitrum DAO treasury and that all surplus revenues belong to the DAO. This includes sequencer revenues.\n\nWe believe that the Arbitrum token needs a staking mechanism. We propose creating a mechanism that distributes ARB to token lockers. A locking mechanism would incentivize long-term token holders and become a fundamental building block for future token utility proposals (e.g., distributing sequencer revenues).\n\nAlong with creating a locking mechanism, we propose requesting 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total ARB token supply from the Arbitrum DAO treasury and distributing this over 12 months through the proposed locking mechanism. The final amount would be decided with a Snapshot and that decision cemented on-chain with a Tally vote. We suggest that the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ gathers data and monitors the impacts of this staking mechanism over the 12-month period and potentially audits the contracts if funded in time. Of course, this relationship is reliant on both proposals passing and the DAO and Coalition Advocate supporting the scope of work for the coalition. The goal is to use these insights to give the DAO the data and tools to refine the ARB staking mechanism further.\n\nIt is important to note that this proposal is entirely separate from the ongoing liquidity incentives framework and grant discussion. Both can and should co-exist - Arbitrum should have a functional grants framework and a staking mechanism. The Arbitrum DAO STIP program has recently concluded, and 50M ARB tokens will enter the market over the coming months. As proposed here, a supply sink through staking would benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIn the discussions over the previous months, we’ve seen the legal aspect be a deterrent to sharing value with ARB token holders in the form of revenue. The way we are proposing the staking mechanism through using existing treasury funds to reward lockers in ARB is the most palatable option from a legal perspective, as it does not involve sharing revenues. It also does not rule out the possibility of later moving on to a model that allows for other value accrual methods to the token. Should our proposal pass, when additional value accrual methods are proposed and the legal landscape is more mature and better understood, the process will likely be much quicker since a staking mechanism is already in use with audited contracts in place.\n\nWe thank the following delegates and others for their valuable feedback while drafting this proposal.\n\nWestie from Blockworks Research\nCoinflipcanada\nAnd several others\n\n# Motivation\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem would benefit in multiple ways from a staking mechanism that is constructed to heavily align incentives with those most aligned with the ecosystem long-term. While staking mechanisms are familiar and a mainstay across DeFi, sustainable models and their impact on the token in question have been scarcely studied. These staking mechanisms are often poorly designed and have rampant inflation that negatively affects the token.\n\nRegarding staking mechanisms, there are few examples to model after in the Layer 2 token space. We propose that the Arbitrum ecosystem takes the first step in this endeavor and leads the way - as it already does in many other verticals. We believe that to construct a long-term staking mechanism that is sustainable, there is first a need to gather actual data that is strictly specific to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the ARB token.\n\nBecause of this, we propose that the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ monitors the effects of this 12-month staking experiment and provides quarterly updates on the impacts of the mechanism through dashboards and qualitative reporting. After the 12-month staking experiment is over, we suggest that the DAO funds the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ to produce a comprehensive report with results and recommendations on what they believe is the most sustainable way forward in building a staking mechanism and incentive model that is sustainable yet attractive for the ARB token. The expertise of the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ is perfectly suited for analyzing the results of this experiment, given that Gauntlet is an industry-leading authority in tokenomics design, Blockworks spearheads the industry’s research efforts and Trail of Bits is a top-tier security organization. To read more about the Arbitrum Coalition, please visit their proposal here.\n\n# Broader Implications for Arbitrum\nThis proposal passing would have extremely positive implications for the entire Arbitrum ecosystem. Having a native staking model that the DAO officially approves would be likely to have the following consequences:\n\n- Significantly increase interest in Arbitrum and the ARB token\n- Allow for composability around an ARB token that can earn yield\n- Reward long-term aligned stakers with yield while penalizing mercenary capital and short-term actors\n- Positively differentiate ARB from any other L2 tokens and bring the spotlight back to Arbitrum\n- Offer a first step and infrastructure towards introducing different forms of revenue sharing in the future\n\nThese are some of the benefits that will likely result from having a staking mechanism; however, verifying these predictions’ accuracy by an independent third party such as the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ is important. These hypotheses cannot be truly verified without actual data, highlighting the importance of a 12-month trial period for staking.\n\n# Benefits for Users\nBy introducing a staking contract that responsibly distributes the allotted amount of tokens to users who are willing to lock their ARB, the incentives are aligned in a way that rewards those parties most loyal to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes long-term holders of ARB and DAOs that have received an airdrop and are willing to lock their tokens.\n\nThe figures below detail possible APRs for stakers at different staked percentages if 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total supply was distributed annually. The current circulating supply of ARB is approximately 1.275B.\n\n![87f8dc9e506d60ebd15f3098d0ff626ee8453c71.png](ipfs://bafkreifv3akc3qub3mmknewbcjwchy2vc7astm2wp33occluoj4r576lu4)\n\n# Specification\n- The ARB staking contract will allow users to lock their ARB for up to 365 calendar days. A user’s weight is proportional to their lock time.\n- Users may increase their lock times.\n- Users may pause their lock times (meaning the time to unlock does not increase this saves having to relock continuously)\n- Users may have many independent locks.\n- Users will receive and may claim ARB emissions according to their weight.\n- Users may exit their lock for a penalty between 0-60% of their lock amount, linear vs. lock time remaining (365 days remaining would mean a 60% penalty, and 0 days would be a 0% penalty). This penalty is shared between remaining users according to weight.\n\nExample usage: ARB locker\n\n- The user locks 100 ARB for 365 days.\n   - The lock weight formula is (ARB amount locked * lock time / 365)\n   - Their ARB lock ‘weight’ is currently 100 (100 ARB * 365/365).\n   - All rewards are distributed based on a user’s weight / the total sum of all the users’ weights.\n- After 182.5 days, the user will have a lock ‘weight’ of 50 (100 ARB * 182.5/365).\n   - At this point, they may increase their lock time, do nothing, or withdraw.\n   - The early exit penalty is (0.6 * lock time / 365)%.\n   - For a lock time of 182.5 days, the penalty is, therefore, 30% of the locked amount - if the user were to withdraw now, they would receive back 70 ARB.\n- ARB staked in this contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. Why a locking mechanism?\n\nA locking mechanism allows users who are long-term believers in Arbitrum to signal this belief through their actions and get rewarded for it accordingly. Locking for longer is always optional - users may lock for any time period. One year is a reasonable lock time compared to the previously popular 4-year locking model. A one-year lock is not too long to the point of disincentiving locking, as users can choose the lock duration. Not only does this give individuals optionality and a mechanism to earn a native yield on their ARB tokens, but it also gives protocols that were a part of the DAO airdrop or have otherwise accumulated ARB a mechanism to earn on their treasury.\n\n2. What are the consequences of this proposal?\n\nUltimately, this proposal introduces utility to ARB and gives users more incentive to hold. In addition, long-term believers will be net increasing their network share, which sets up a base from which we can build further proposals for ARB value accrual without worrying about the distribution mechanism.\n\n3. What would this staking mechanism mean for delegation?\n\nFrom a user standpoint, it’s important to note that the ARB staked in the proposed contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length. The staking contract will be upgradeable and controlled by the DAO - this ensures that the DAO can pause this distribution at any time.\n\n# Summary\nAs it stands today, ARB has no native utility or yield. We propose approving the creation of the staking contract detailed above and distributing an equivalent of 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25%, or 1% of the total ARB supply from the DAO treasury to the staking contract. These tokens would be distributed over a 12-month period, during which the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ could - pending their proposal passing - monitor the impacts of the proposed staking mechanism and draft a report and recommendations by the end of the period. Note that the Arbitrum Coalition proposal is entirely separate yet synergistic to this proposal. The passing of either proposal is not conditional on the other proposal’s performance.\n\nIt’s important to highlight that to move toward a final and refined version of value accrual to the ARB token, trial and experimentation is required. We believe there is a strong need for actual data from a live staking mechanism, such as the one suggested in this proposal, from the unique context of Arbitrum’s growing ecosystem to make more informed decisions on what the ultimate mechanism for ARB staking and value accrual might look like.\n\nInnovation has always been Arbitrum’s forte in both technical advancements and building a vibrant community - we believe that the approach to building a cutting-edge staking model for ARB through trial and experimentation is a logical way forward.\n\n# Timeline\nThis proposal will follow the official lifecycle of an AIP detailed here. Please note that this proposal is a non-constitutional proposal.\n\nThe suggested timeline can be found below.\n\nWeek 36-37 - Forum post, request for comments and feedback (Complete)\nWeek 43-44 - Temperature check forum post & Snapshot poll (1 week)\nWeek 45 - Formal AIP and call-for-voting (3 days)\nWeek 45-46 - On-chain DAO vote on Tally (14 days)\nWeek 47 onwards - Implementation phase\n\nIf the proposal passes, a draft of the implementation phase is detailed below in “Suggested Steps to Implement.” The final implementation schedule depends on the result of the vendor decision proposal, community review, audit schedules, and subsequent findings. A concrete schedule for the implementation stage will thus be locked in at a later stage.\n\n# Voting Options on Snapshot\nWhen this proposal moves to Snapshot, there will be five voting options. The voting method will be ranked choice voting. To read more about ranked choice voting, please visit this article from Snapshot.\n\n1. Fund staking with 1.75% of the total ARB supply (175M ARB tokens)\n2. Fund staking with 1.5% of the total ARB supply (150M ARB tokens)\n3. Fund staking with 1.25% of the total ARB supply (125M ARB tokens)\n4. Fund staking with 1% of the total ARB supply (100M ARB tokens)\n5. Do not fund staking\n\n# Suggested Steps to Implement\n1. The Arbitrum DAO will receive another proposal concerning implementation, which will aim to decide the vendor of the implementation and associated contracts and an auditor.\n2. After the contracts and audits are finished, they will be provided to the community for review for two weeks.\n3. After the community review period, the contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum, and the ownership will be transferred to the DAO.\n4. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n# Costs\nThe costs of this proposal are mainly related to the implementation process, during which a vendor and auditor will be decided. The true extent of these costs can only be estimated after these decisions are made.",

        "body": "## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP outlines a path toward activating Stylus on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. Stylus is an upgrade that introduces a new virtual machine that runs alongside the EVM. This enables developers to write smart contracts in new programming languages, like Rust, that are more efficient than Solidity smart contracts.\n\n## Motivation\n\nStylus is a first-of-its-kind technology resulting from breakthrough engineering efforts in the Arbitrum ecosystem. Unlike other alternative VMs, Stylus is purely additive to the EVM. This means that Stylus contracts and EVM contracts are fully interoperable.\n\nSome defining features of Stylus include:\n\n- Preferred Languages: There are [estimated](https://research.slashdata.co/reports/65b90140343d024fbe70f369) to be roughly 20k Solidity developers, compared to 3.5 million Rust developers and 10 million C++ developers. Developers can use their preferred programming language, all interoperable with each other, on any Arbitrum chain with Stylus. Scaling to the next billion users requires onboarding the next million developers.\n- EVM+: Stylus brings the best of both worlds. Developers still get all of the benefits of the EVM, including the ecosystem and liquidity, while getting efficiency improvements and access to existing libraries in Rust, C, and C++ — without changing anything about how the EVM works. EVM equivalence is no longer the ceiling; it’s the floor.\n- Cheaper Execution: Stylus is a more efficient execution environment than the EVM, leading directly to gas savings for complex smart contracts. Computation can be over 10x cheaper, and memory can be over 100x cheaper. Cryptography libraries can be deployed as custom application layer precompiles, permissionlessly. Use cases that are impractical in the EVM are now possible in Stylus.\n- Safer By Design: Stylus doesn’t just improve on cost and speed. WASM programs are also safer. Reentrancy is a common vulnerability that developers can only attempt to mitigate in Solidity. Stylus provides cheap reentrancy detection, and using the Rust SDK, reentrancy is disabled by default, unless intentionally overridden.\n- Fully Interoperable: Solidity programs and WASM programs are completely composable. If working in Solidity, a developer can call a Rust program or rely on another dependency in a different language. If working in Rust, all Solidity functionalities are accessible out of the box. This means your Rust smart contracts can rely on primitives and infrastructure (such as oracles) that were built using Solidity.\n\nSeveral exciting teams have been building their apps on the Stylus testnet for the past few months. These apps would simply not be possible on Arbitrum without the added efficiency or new language support. Stylus can onboard (1) the next generation of developers from alternate VM ecosystems and (2) new use cases that users cannot experience on EVM chains.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal is aligned with the Arbitrum community’s mission and values:\n- Ethereum-Aligned: Stylus does not change anything about how the EVM works. Rather than replacing, Stylus is completely additive and extends what is possible in the EVM.\n- Sustainable: More efficiency at the execution layer can give Arbitrum chains long-term competitive advantages by allowing higher throughput, cheaper costs, and new use cases that are not possible on other EVM chains.\n- Accessibility: Arbitrum can become the home for new types of developers who don’t know Solidity. This includes Rust, C, C++, and any other programming language that compiles to WebAssembly.\n- Inclusivity: The Stylus SDK is 100% open-source, meaning developers are free to fork, modify, and contribute to the core patterns that the SDK represents.\n- Empowerment: The parameters defined in Stylus are fully configurable by the Arbitrum DAO (for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) and individual Orbit chains. These customizations can supercharge Stylus by, for example, dropping activation prices, increasing contract size limits, and lowering opcode pricing.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nStylus: A new programming environment, including a WebAssembly-based virtual machine, a CLI, and a canonical SDK that defines the patterns and frameworks for writing smart contracts.\n\nWebAssembly (WASM): WebAssembly is a modern binary format used in significant web standards, browsers, and companies to speed up computation. Built to be fast, portable, and secure.\n\nVirtual Machine (VM): The software that executes smart contracts and processes transactions.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:\n\nThe Stylus VM and fraud prover have been developed as a fork of the Nitro codebase. These repositories will be merged into the main branch of Nitro if the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP:\n\n- stylus: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro)\n  - Includes node software, VM, and Fraud Prover\n- stylus-geth: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-geth](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-geth)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/go-ethereum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/go-ethereum)\n  - Includes the execution client and databases\n- stylus-contracts: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-contracts)\n  - Fork of [GitHub - OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro-contracts)\n  - Includes rollup and fraud proof smart contracts\n\nThe Stylus VM is not a replacement for the EVM. Instead, the two VMs work together to facilitate state transitions, each playing their part in executing their respective bytecode. EVM contracts written in Solidity still use Geth’s EVM exactly as before, ensuring EVM equivalence. In other words, Stylus is entirely additive — a paradigm called EVM+.\n\nStylus contracts can be written using the Stylus SDK, which employs Solidity-equivalent ABIs and storage patterns to ensure cross-language interoperability. For example, existing Solidity DEXs can list Rust tokens without modification. New SDKs for additional programming languages can be added over time. Current SDK repositories:\n\n- Rust SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs: Rust Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-rs)\n- C/C++ SDK: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c: C/C++ Smart Contracts on Arbitrum](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus-sdk-c)\n- Stylus CLI: [GitHub - OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus: Cargo subcommand for developing Arbitrum Stylus projects in Rust](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/cargo-stylus)\n\nIf you would like to better understand the lifecycle of a Stylus contract, head over to [A Gentle Introduction: Stylus](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction).\n\nThere are some relevant components of Stylus that are listed below:\n\n- Host I/Os\n- The Memory Model\n- Dynamic Learning\n- Activation Pricing\n- Opcode Pricing\n\nMore details on these components can be found in the corresponding [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-activate-stylus-and-enable-next-gen-webassembly-smart-contracts-arbos-30/22970), which is also linked below.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves the AIP, the path would consist of:\n\n1. Discussion of the proposal on the forum\n2. Completing the audit and remaining code changes\n3. Merging the Stylus branch into the canonical Nitro codebase\n4. A vote on Snapshot to enable Stylus on Arbitrum Sepolia\n5. Sufficient time for testing on a public testnet that emulates production environments\n6. An onchain vote to deploy the upgrade on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova\n\n## Timeline\n\nStylus is rapidly progressing toward being production-ready. Once it is, ideally the upgrade can take place on Arbitrum Sepolia, and Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova afterwards. An onchain vote for this AIP will only occur once there is a public audit report.\n\nNOTE:\nIf this vote passes on Snapshot, the tentative plan is to upgrade Arbitrum Sepolia to ArbOS 30 the week of June 10th.\n\nIf Arbitrum Sepolia upgrades to ArbOS 30, there will be an ecosystem-wide plan to ensure non-breaking compatibility of infrastructure and applications with Stylus, which will take several weeks or months. The ultimate goal is that the experience for EVM developers remains as unchanged as possible if ArbOS reaches mainnet. Once enough confidence is reached, there will be an onchain vote to upgrade Arbitrum One and Nova to ArbOS 30. The Arbitrum community will be informed of any significant updates as they arise.",
