        "body": "title: [ARFC] Prime Instance - Restore ETH LTV \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-02-04\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes restoring ETH's LTV to 82% on the Prime instance of Aave v3.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the introduction of liquidity mining rewards for ETH deposits on Prime, some users exploited wETH/wETH leverage to farm rewards. In response, ETHâ€™s LTV was set to 0, preventing new ETH collateral positions while preserving existing ones.\n\nTransitioning from direct liquidity mining emissions to a periodic Merkl distribution ensures that users leveraging wETH/wETH can be disqualified from rewards. By introducing qualification criteria, incentives are directed toward users who engage with the protocol as intended.\n\nWhile details of the future liquidity mining program are yet to be announced, this proposal focuses on re-enabling ETH collateral positions by restoring the LTV to 82%â€”its original level at Primeâ€™s launch.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe LTV for ETH on Prime is to be amended as outlined below:\n\n| **Parameter**             |  **Current** | **Proposed** |\n| --------------------- | -------- | -------- |\n| LTV                   |  0.00%   |  82.00%  |\n\nThe ETH Correlated eMode category is to be amended as outlined below:\n\n| **Parameter**             |  **Value** | **Value** |\n| --------------------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Asset                          |  wETH   | wstETH  |\n| Collateral                   |  Yes -> **No**  |  Yes |\n| Borrowable                |  Yes   |  No  |\n| LTV                             |  93.50%  |  93.50%  |\n| LT                               |  95.50%   |  95.50%   |\n| Liquidation Penalty   |  1.00%     |  1.00%  |\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

To minimise governance overhead, the Ethereum v2 and Avalanche v2 updates will be combined, with the later implemented by the Guardian. There remains only one to two Polygon RF updates and these will be submitted separately.\n\nDo note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect user's health factor, and this method has already been implemented on [Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-reserve-factor-updates-polygon-aave-v2/13937) and [Ethereum v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-reserve-factor-adjustment/16764).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.\n\n| Asset | Current RF| Initial RF Increase | Subsequent RF Increase|\n| :---:  | :---:    |:---:     |:---:     |\n| DAI.e  | 10.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n| USDC.e | 10.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n| USDT.e | 10.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n| wAVAX  | 15.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n| WBTC.e | 10.00% | 40.00% | 45.00% |\n| WETH.e | 10.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal.

The adjustment will harmonize the wstETH Borrow Rate across all Aave v3 instances that support LRT collateral, except for the Core instance.\n\nSeveral teams plan to introduce rewards to bootstrap growth across various Aave instances. While these incentives are necessary to meet users' return expectations, they are not yet sustainable. Reducing the wstETH Borrow Rate allows teams to allocate their incentive budgets more effectively, supporting a larger AUM base and extending the duration of reward campaigns.\n\nIncreased utilization of the wstETH reserve is expected to enhance revenue generation for the Aave DAO while delivering higher returns for users participating in the wstETH/ETH yield strategy.\n\nThe proposed wstETH Borrow Rate parameters for Aave v3 instances (excluding the Core instance) are as follows:\n\n| Paramater | Value |\n|:--------- | :---: |\n| Base      | 0.00% |\n| Slope1    | 0.75% |\n| Slope2    | 85.0% |\n| Uoptimal  | 90.0% |\n\nDue to the size of the wstETH reserve on the Core instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum, this instance is excluded from this proposal.\n\nWith LRTs already listed on Arbitrum, Base, Scroll, and zkSync, the proposed changes will be implemented on these networks first. \n\nFuture proposals that onboard LRTs to instances of Aave v3 that do not yet include LRTs, shall also include the the wstETH Borrow Rate update. \n\n# Specification\n\nUpdate Arbitrum, Base, Scroll and ZKSync wstETH Borrow Rate:\n\n| Paramater | Value |\n|:--------- | :---: |\n| Base      | 0.00% |\n| Slope1    | 0.75% |\n| Slope2    | 85.0% |\n| Uoptimal  | 90.0% |\n\nWhen implemented this proposal will harmonise the wstETH Borrow Rate with Prime instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Base Incentive Campaign Funding \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2025-05-06\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes launching a targeted incentive campaign to accelerate Aave's adoption and growing market share on the Base network. \n\n# Motivation\n\nDuring April variable Debt on Base has increased strongly on Aave Protocol from 337.9M to 377.9M, an 11.83% increase, meanwhile user deposits increased by only 3.92%. The growing demand for liquidity creates a competitive environment for both attracting user deposits and providing attractive funding rates.\n\nThe chart below highlights the improvement in demand for liquidity on the Base instance of Aave v3. The recent uptick in debt during April was only bettered by Avalanche and Ethereum v3 instances. Whilst Base continues to grow, Aave's positioning can be improved by capturing a large portion of the debt expansion in the coming months.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-05-03 at 00.05.54](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1-1gRzxgx.png)\n\nWith the use of incentives to create an improved deposit yield and lower cost of capital for borrowers, the resulting demand is expected to attract new liquidity deposits and new users seeking access to lower borrowing costs. Improving the value proposition for the end user is expected to strengthen Aave's positioning within the Base ecosystem. \n\n### Incentives Allocation\n\nWith the use of targeted incentives and enhanced capital efficiency, the expected returns are strengthen by only rewarding Aave aligned user actions. The MASiv incentive distribution platform provides the infrastructure needed to reward users who migrate liquidity to Aave Protocol whilst also recognising the loyalty of existing users.\n\nThe table below outlines the initial rewards to be distributed to eligible users of Aave Protocol. The core component on the program relies on providing users with a low cost of capital whilst providing an attractive deposit rate that exceeds the SSR within defined budgetary constraints.\n\n|    Action   |  Borrow Rewards | Campaign Duration | Reward Asset |          Criteria           |\n| :---------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :----------: | :-------------------------- |\n| Borrow USDC | 2.00% up to 250M before dilution  |     6 months      | aUSDC | Borrow USDC whilst having no idle USDC or aUSDC holdings. When total USDC debt on Aave exceeds 250M the rewards begin to dilute with increasing debt pro-rata. ie: 500M USDC debt equates to 1.00% in rewards.|\n| Borrow GHO | 2.50% up to 50M  before dilution |     6 months      | aGHO | Borrow GHO whilst having no idle or aToken stablecoin holdings. When total GHO debt on Aave exceeds 50M the rewards begin to dilute with increasing debt pro-rata. ie: 100M GHO debt equates to 1.50% in rewards. |\n\nAn additional boost is to be provided to users who meet the criteria outlined below. To support identifying eligible users, a Snapshot of non Aave Protocol users was taken on the 2nd May 2025.\n\n|    Action   |  Supply Boost   | Campaign Duration | Reward Asset |         Criteria           |\n| :---------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :----------: |:-------------------------- |\n| Deposit cbBTC |  0.20%  | 3 months | acbBTC  | Migrate 100% of holdings from Morpho on Base and/or Ethereum to Aave on Base, **Borrow USDC, GHO, WETH or EURC**, Maintain Health Factor <2 with no idle or aToken USDC, GHO, WETH or EURC holdings.|\n| Deposit wstETH |  0.50%  | 3 months | awstETH  | Migrate 100% of holdings from Morpho to Aave on Base only, **Borrow USDC, GHO, WETH or EURC**, Maintain Health Factor <2 with no idle or aToken USDC, GHO, WETH or EURC holdings.|\n| Deposit USDC |   1.00%  | 3 months | aUSDC  | Withdraw 100% of holdings from Moonwell and Gauntlet vaults on Morpho on Base to Aave on Base.  |\n| Deposit GHO |   1.25%  | 3 months | aGHO  | Withdraw 100% of USDC holdings from Moonwell and Gauntlet vaults on Morpho on Base to Aave on Base. |\n| Deposit ETH |   1.25%  | 3 months | aWETH  | Migrate 100% of holdings from Moonwell and Gauntlet vaults on Morpho to Aave on Base Network.  |\n| Deposit ETH |   1.50%  | 3 months | aWETH  |  Migrate 100% of holdings from Moonwell and Gauntlet vaults on Morpho on Base to Aave on Base only, **Borrow USDC or EURC**, Maintain Health Factor <2 with no idle or aToken stablecoin holdings. |\n| Deposit ETH |   1.75%  | 3 months | aWETH  |  Migrate 100% of holdings from Moonwell and Gauntlet vaults on Morpho on Base to Aave on Base only, **Borrow GHO**, Maintain Health Factor <2 with no idle or aToken stablecoin holdings.   |\n\nFor example:\n\nA user with cbBTC on Morpho at the time of Snapshot can migrate 100% of the position to Aave, borrow USDC and GHO such that the health factor of the loan is <2 and earns 0.35% deposit yield, receive 2% discount on the USDC debt and 2.50% discount on any GHO debt.\n\nThe GHO portion of the debt receives a 3.00% discount whilst the USDC portion of the debt receives 2.50% discount.\n\nIf the borrowed USDC or GHO is held idle or deposited into Aave, the user receives no USDC and no GHO debt rewards. \n\nIf 99% of the cbBTC position withdrawn and migrated to Aave, but 1% remain on Morpho, user receives no deposit deposit yield.\n\nIf the cbBTC price appreciates and the Health Factor is >2, the user forgoes the 0.35% deposit yield for this duration of time. \n\nUsers are encouraged to manage the position on Aave to ensure eligibility is maintained. \n\n### Funding\n\nAave has accumulated significant revenues on the Base network via its Collector contract. To further stimulate growth, adoption on Base, this proposal aims to reinvest past revenue directly into ecosystem incentives. \n\nSince the Base instance was deployed a total of 1.3M USD in revenue has been generated for the Aave DAO with 675,510 USD year to date. The Reserve Factor (Borrow Fees) is the dominant fee type generating 365.7K during Q4 2024 and 397.7K during Q1 2025, with liquidation fees providing a notable 140.6k USD contribution during Q1.\n\nThe charts below shows the weekly revenue generated by the Aave Protocol, Velora integration on the frontend and aTokens held in the Treasury.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 23.31.28](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1AaPaGlee.png)\n\n![Screenshot 2025-05-06 at 21.53.17|1318x414](upload://e9PEtKpXJMixtk0cbiEickpcFT1.png)\n\nTo fund the upcoming incentive campaign, USDC, USDbC and cbBTC aTokens held in the Treasury is to be reinvested directly into ecosystem incentives. The ETH rewards component is to be funded from the existing Ahab Budget and GHO rewards mostly funded from the ALC budget. \n\nBased upon Q1 2025 USDC Reserve Factor revenue, 236.1K USD, without considering the impact of the program, approximately 39% of the associated USDC Borrow Rewards cost would be recovered. If 100% growth in USDC debt is achieved, revenue would double along with the USDC Borrow Rewards cost. \n\n![Screenshot 2025-05-03 at 13.08.07](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H184vFmeee.png)\n\nGranting the AFC the permission to claim and transfer these funds to the MASiv address will enable efficient reinvestment of capital, supporting user growth, liquidity incentives, and ecosystem expansion on Base.\n\nThis ARFC proposes to grant the Aave Finance Committee (AFC) the allowance to claim all the revenues currently accrued to the Aave Collector on Base. The claimed revenues will be directed to the MASiv address to be used as incentives for the Aave ecosystem on Base.\n\n# Specification\n\nCreate allowances for the Aave Finance Committee to fund the Base incentive campaign.\n\n| Asset     | Amount   | Address  |\n| --------  | -------- | -------- |\n| aBasUSDC  |    ALL   | Base: `0x4e65fE4DbA92790696d040ac24Aa414708F5c0AB` |\n| aBascbBTC |    ALL   | Base: `0xBdb9300b7CDE636d9cD4AFF00f6F009fFBBc8EE6` |\n| aBasUSDbC |    ALL   | Base: `0x0a1d576f3eFeF75b330424287a95A366e8281D54` |\n| aEthUSDC  |   2.4M   | Ethereum: `0x98C23E9d8f34FEFb1B7BD6a91B7FF122F4e16F5c` |\n\n- Spender: AFC `0x22740deBa78d5a0c24C58C740e3715ec29de1bFa`\n- Method: approve() aBasUSDC, aBascbBTC and aBasUSDbC on the Aave Base Collector contract `0xBA9424d650A4F5c80a0dA641254d1AcCE2A37057`to the AFC address\n\nAll claimed funds will be sent to the MASiv address when the whole incentive structure is finished, which will be responsible for managing and distributing incentives on Base.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Set Aave Chan Initiative as Emission Manager for fdUSD on BNB Chain Aave V3\nAuthor: Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\nDated: 2024-02-06\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes to set the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emission manager for the fdUSD token on BNB Chain Aave V3 markets. This will enable the ACI to enact incentive programs funded by BNB Chain ecosystem partners for all fdUSD markets, promoting growth and expanding the user base of Aave on the BNB Chain.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been in discussion with various parties that have a desire to actively contribute to the growth and development of the Aave V3 on the BNB Chain. In order to facilitate emissions by various stakeholders, ACI proposes becoming the emissions manager for fdUSD on BNB Chain. Emission incentives will be sent to ACI multisig and distributed as agreed on with partners. By setting the multisig as the emission manager for the fdUSD token, the ACI will be able to directly manage incentive programs that can attract more users to the pool and stimulate activity. This aligns with the broader goals of the Aave community to foster active and engaged markets on the BNB Chain.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe ACI multisig address bnb:0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd will be set as Emissions manager.\n\nThe call to the setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract will be as follows:\n\n`EMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(fdUSD, 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd);`\n\nThis method will set the ACI multisig as the emission admin for the fdUSD token on BNB Chain Aave V3 markets.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is working with various BNB Chain ecosystem partners to define the emissions program for Aave v3 BNB Chain. ACI has not been paid by any third party for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
