    "summary": "The proposal requests a grant of up to 3.09 million ARB to support and expand Camelot's liquidity incentives on Arbitrum. Camelot is the largest native DEX on Arbitrum and plays a critical role in the ecosystem's liquidity and growth. The community sentiment is predominantly supportive, emphasizing the importance of sustaining Camelot's innovative liquidity management and ecosystem contributions. While some concerns about the grant size and efficiency metrics exist, the overall support and lessons from past similar proposals favor approval. Early and stable timeline voting metrics strongly back the proposal, reinforcing community conviction. Market impacts show minor negative shifts but are not decisive against the proposal’s value proposition.",
