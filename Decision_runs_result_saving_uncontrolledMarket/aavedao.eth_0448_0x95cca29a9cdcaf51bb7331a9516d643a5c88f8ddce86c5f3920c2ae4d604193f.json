The proposed risk parameters for LUSD will mirror those currently in place for USDC on the same pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by users of the Liquity Protocol. It has demonstrated its resilience and maintained a stable peg, even in volatile market conditions. By adding LUSD as a collateral asset on the Aave V3 ETH pool, we can offer our users more options for their DeFi activities. Furthermore, the integration of LUSD could potentially synergize with the GHO, enhancing liquidity and further reinforcing the stability of the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed risk parameters for LUSD on the Aave V3 ETH pool are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 77% |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 80% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 4.5% |\n\nThese parameters are identical to those currently in place for USDC on the Aave V3 ETH pool.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173/13) program, the ACI has not been compensated by any third-party to present this ARFC.\nAt the time of writing, the author does not hold LQTY tokens but owns some LUSD.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP for final approval and implementation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] BUSD Offboarding Plan Part III\nAuthor: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\nDate: 2023-07-25\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposal outlines the third part of the offboarding plan for BUSD on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The plan aims to further reduce the amount of liquidity in BUSD and encourage users to switch to other stablecoins. The plan involves modification of BUSD risk parameters and withdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract. The plan will be enforced in a single AIP.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPlease refer to the first and second parts of the BUSD offboarding plan for more context. The first two parts of the plan were successful, driving out liquidity and incentivizing active users to repay their debt and move their position to other stablecoins. The remaining vBUSD debt holders seem to be inactive or unaffected by high rates, due to the time-sensitive nature of BUSD/Paxos situation and the potential risk of protocol bad debt.\n\nThis third part of the offboarding plan will concentrate efforts on creating unsustainable positions for remaining borrowers to either motivate them enough to repay or reach liquidation thresholds.\n\nBoth actions are proposed to be performed:\n\n- Modify risk parameters to “force” slope 2 interest rate curve and increase slope 2 aggressiveness\n- Remove aBUSD from the collector contract to increase the utilization ratio of BUSD and increase the cost of open positions.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe offboarding plan will be carried out in a single AIP with the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| uOptimal | 1% |\n| Reserve Factor | 99.9% |\n| Base Rate | 100% |\n| Slope 1 | 70% |\n| Slope 2 | 300% |\n\nThis will result in a 470% APR cost at 100% utilization rate.\n\nWithdrawal of aBUSD from the collector contract. The BUSD will be kept as such in the collector contract, and a separate AIP will organize the swap of BUSD into other assets at a later stage.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the community approves ARFC, Publication of an AIP implementation.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by Binance to publish this ARFC. At the time of writing, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, Does not hold any BUSD.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The process will follow a similar process as the [BUSD offboarding plan part I](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-busd-offboarding-plan/12170).\n\n*Gauntlet does not quantify risk associated with centralized stablecoins and regulatory concerns. In light of this, we provide this framework with ACI to the community to gauge preference and thoughts around further TUSD deprecation.* \n\n## Motivation\nTUSD has been a historic asset of the Aave ecosystem, but due to recent events, the ACI suggests consideration of its offboarding. The offboarding plan leverages the previous success of the BUSD offboarding plan and will incentive current users to slowly migrate their positions to other stablecoins on Aave.\n\n\nPrevious proposals have [frozen TUSD](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/253/) and [lowered TUSD LT to 77.5%. ](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/256/) These proposals have reduced TUSD borrow and supply over the past 30 days, from 20M supplied and 18M borrowed, to 13.1M supplied and 6.8M borrowed today.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed changes to the TUSD risk parameters:\n\n| Parameter                | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| LTV                      | 75%           | 0%             |\n| Liquidation Bonus        | 5%            | 10%            |\n| Reserve Factor           | 25%           | 95%            |\n| Borrowing Enabled        | Yes           | No             |\n| Stable Borrowing Enabled | Yes           | No             |\n| Base Rate                | 0%            | 3%             |\n| Slope1                   | 4%            | 7%             |\n| Slope2                   | 100%          | 200%           |\n| UOptimal                 | 80%           | 20%            |\n\nMeanwhile, Gauntlet provides the following options to lower LT. \n- This sets immediate bounds on the maximum debt that can be taken out with TUSD collateral, however it may force liquidate users.\n\n##\n**Option 1: lower LT to 75%**. \n0 Forced liquidations, as of data on 2023.07.13.\n\n**Option 2: lower LT to 60%**. \nForced liquidations - total ~ $877k in supply, 4 accounts, as of data on 2023.07.13\n| Address                                             | Health Factor | Health Factor with New Parameters | Total Borrows (USD) | Total Supply (USD) | Assets Borrowed             | Assets Supplied            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 0x16af29b7efbf019ef30aae9023a5140c012374a5 | 1.05          | 0.82                             | 644897.59           | 877486.0           | [WETH]                      | [TUSD]                     |\n| 0xd4b954c7dbd77c2fadcd66ec681dd992e97a9374 | 1.05          | 0.81                             | 80.69               | 109.0              | [WETH]                      | [TUSD]                     |\n| 0xb56b29401afcc285d7b967a3164bfa58f94f70e7 | 1.10          | 0.85                             | 73.04               | 103.0              | [USDC]                      | [TUSD]                     |\n| 0x017b3763b8a034f8655d46345e3eb42555e39064 | 1.05          | 0.81                             | 0.00                | 0.0                | [SNX]                       | [TUSD]                     |\n\n\n**Option 3: lower LT to 40%**. \nForced liquidations - total ~ $920k in supply, 7 accounts, as of data on 2023.07.13\n| Address                                             | Health Factor | Health Factor with New Parameters | Total Borrows (USD) | Total Supply (USD) | Assets Borrowed             | Assets Supplied            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 0x16af29b7efbf019ef30aae9023a5140c012374a5 | 1.05          | 0.54                             | 644897.59           | 877486.0           | [WETH]                      | [TUSD]                     |\n| 0xe66c21632e5fe9884b43c9b2573a61373a7264d9 | 1.02          | 0.98                             | 27214.96            | 32409.0            | [WETH, USDC, TUSD]          | [AAVE, WETH, USDC, TUSD]    |\n| 0xea40afcba852f3c9b4d47f91b5ca6924283498df | 1.42          | 0.91                             | 6401.85             | 11479.0            | [USDC, DAI]                 | [WBTC, USDC, TUSD]          |\n| 0xd4b954c7dbd77c2fadcd66ec681dd992e97a9374 | 1.05          | 0.54                             | 80.69               | 109.0              | [WETH]                      | [TUSD]                     |\n| 0xb56b29401afcc285d7b967a3164bfa58f94f70e7 | 1.10          | 0.57                             | 73.04               | 103.0              | [USDC]                      | [TUSD]                     |\n| 0x2648e99bc8ebf9164cff4b0432d0522618e65241 | 1.67          | 0.86                             | 11.03               | 24.0               | [DAI]                       | [TUSD]                     |\n| 0x017b3763b8a034f8655d46345e3eb42555e39064 | 1.05          | 0.54                             | 0.00                | 0.0                | [SNX]                       | [TUSD]                     |\n\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.

        "body": "## Title: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard STG to Ethereum Aave v3\n## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n## Date: 2023-09-07\n\n--\n\n## Summary:\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the onboarding of the STG token to the Ethereum Aave v3 Liquidity Pool. \n\n## Motivation:\n\nStargate is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol central to Omnichain DeFi. It enables users and dApps to transfer native assets across chains while tapping into the protocol’s unified liquidity pools with immediate guaranteed finality. \n\nOver the past month, Stargate has processed transactions exceeding $3.4 Billion, marking its position as the largest bridge in the crypto domain. The STG token, serving as the utility and governance token for the Stargate protocol, boasts a market capitalization of roughly $110,000,000 and a circulating supply nearing 200,000,000 STG.\n\nIntegrating the STG token into the Ethereum Aave v3 will enhance asset diversification, offering borrowers and lenders expanded avenues to leverage the protocol. This integration will empower users to deposit STG as collateral and also borrow STG, paving the way for new revenue streams for Aave.\n\nThis onboarding is considered in isolation mode with conservative LTV and debt ceiling parameters to limit protocol exposure.\n\n## Specification:\n\n\n- **Ticker**: STG\n- **Contract Address**: 0xaf5191b0de278c7286d6c7cc6ab6bb8a73ba2cd6\n- **Chainlink Oracle STG/USD**: [Chainlink Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7A9f34a0Aa917D438e9b6E630067062B7F8f6f3d)\n\n### Proposed Risk Parameters:\n\n| Parameter               | Value       |\n|-------------------------|-------------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)     | 35%    |\n| Liquidation Threshold   | 40%    |\n| Liquidation Penalty     | 10%    |\n| Reserve Factor          | 20%    |\n| Debt Ceiling            | 5M$ |\n| Supply Cap            | 10M STG |\n| Borrow Cap            | 8M STG |\n| Stable borrowing | Disabled |\n| Optimal Utilization Ratio | 45% |\n| Base rate | 0% |\n| Slope 1 | 7% |\n| Slope 2 | 300% |\n\n(Note: If this proposal reaches ARFC stage, the risk Teams will be invited to provide feedback and fine-tune these parameters)\n\n## Next Steps:\n1. Gather community feedback on this TEMP CHECK.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the TEMP CHECK Snapshot stage.\n3. if TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, publish forum ARFC and collect both community & service providers feedbacks\n4. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n5. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173).\nThe ACI has not been paid by Stargate or any third party to propose this TEMP CHECK, at the time of writing, the Author does not own any STG token.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The BUSD will be kept as such in the collector contract, and a separate AIP will organize the swap of BUSD into other assets at a later stage.\n\n## **Next steps**\n\n- Gather community consensus & feedback on this ARFC\n- Snapshot polling vote on the ARFC\n- If the community approves ARFC via Snapshot vote, Publication of an AIP implementation.\n\n## **Disclamer**\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by Binance to publish this ARFC.\n\nAt the time of writing, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, Does not hold any BUSD.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",
