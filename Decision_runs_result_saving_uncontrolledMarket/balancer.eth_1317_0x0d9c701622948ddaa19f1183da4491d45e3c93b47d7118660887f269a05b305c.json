Rehype Pools build on top of the E-CLP's asymmetric concentrated liquidity profile, improving capital efficiency on two fronts. As per previous arrangements between Balancer and Gnosis this pool shall not bear any protocol fees for the time being.\n\n### References/Useful links\n* [Documentation of Rehype Pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n* \"Savings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\" - [Spark](https://docs.spark.fi/defi-infrastructure/sdai-overview)\n* aUSDC is the deposit receipt token issued by the [Aave](https://aave.com/) protocol to lenders of USDC. Since aTokens are rebasing, this pool uses BGD Labs's [statA wrapper](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3) that is a repricing representation of statA tokens that reflects the accruing lending yield.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\nGyroscope is expanding to Gnosis Chain.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n#### Governance\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n #### Oracles\n n/a\n\n#### Audits\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n#### Centralization vectors\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains.

They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * T**he pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs ](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website ](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * [When staking ETH with RocketPool] you will be given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH you deposited, and when you deposited it. The ratio includes rewards that Rocket Pool node operators earn from: The Beacon Chain itself, Priority fees from block proposals, and MEV rewards from block proposals. - [RocketPool](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token)\n> * WETH is a wrapper-token and an ERC-20 token representing ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n> * The E-CLP uses an internal conversion to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> **We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles:** Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds:** The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n> \n> **For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs view**: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n> \n> E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs). \n\n## Specifications\n\n> ### Governance\n> \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n> ### Oracles\n> \n> * rateProvider0 (for WETH): 0x00\n> * rateProvider1 (for rETH): [0x60b39bec6af8206d1e6e8dfc63cea214a506d6c3](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x60b39bec6af8206d1e6e8dfc63cea214a506d6c3#readContract)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n> ### Audits\n> \n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n> ### Centralization vectors\n> \n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n> ### Market History\n> \n> C.f. contracts.\n\n> ### Value\n> \n> As per “Motivation”. Other zkEVM pools with these assets exist, but none of them feature asymmetrically concentrated liquidity. Asymmetric concentrated liquidity for these assets could become a substantial driver of trading volume and total value locked.\n\n> ## Contracts\n> \n> * wstETH/cbETH E-CLP: [0xb1557CFEA06De5a1601a7F0cCF3b515EF431A50d](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0xb1557cfea06de5a1601a7f0ccf3b515ef431a50d)\n> * zkEVM gauge: [0xEdEa3E93b914E2654F8c7e0C2bb5E6205f9742b0](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0xedea3e93b914e2654f8c7e0c2bb5e6205f9742b0)\n> * Mainnet gauge: [0x42a3290a65CA16Adaf161c6FfAfDBE0913A169F4](https://etherscan.io/address/0x42a3290a65CA16Adaf161c6FfAfDBE0913A169F4)\n\nSpecifcation:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x42a3290a65CA16Adaf161c6FfAfDBE0913A169F4`\ngaugeType(string): `PolygonZkEvm`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/915\n\n**Summary:**\n> * This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for WETH/wstETH on Polygon zkEVM.\n> * The underlying pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IAVN7mDiPt4teeuBUMqi0KJdZ2aiRWwGAxRhJU75TB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> * Lido’s wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * WETH is an ERC-20 version of ETH. - [WETH](https://weth.io/)\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n>\n> * Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n>\n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. A similar E-CLP to the one mentioned in this proposal has been recently deployed on Arbitrum. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\n> The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n**Oracles:**\n> * rateProvider0 (for WETH): 0x00\n> * rateProvider1 (for wstETH): [0x8dd590Ebb702C21A41289A0a69B0C6F74BdeCE75](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x8dd590Ebb702C21A41289A0a69B0C6F74BdeCE75)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n**Audits:**\n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports) (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n**Market History:** \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n \n**Value:** As per “Motivation”. \n\n**Contracts**\n> * WETH/wstETH E-CLP: [0xe58cD0C79CDff6252476b3445BEE1400503e0aE0](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0xe58cd0c79cdff6252476b3445bee1400503e0ae0)\n> * Childchain gauge on Polygon zkEVM: [0x8dd928a3Aa0274bBA3b42DD9F41756AaF1e78b2f](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x8dd928a3Aa0274bBA3b42DD9F41756AaF1e78b2f)\n> * Polygon zkEVM root gauge on Ethereum: [0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F)\n\n**Technical specification**\n> The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n> gauge(address): `0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F` \n> gaugeType(string): `PolygonZkEvm`",
