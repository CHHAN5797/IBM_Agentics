        "body": "**Title:** [TEMP CHECK] Updated Aave Grants Continuation Proposal\n\n**Author:** Bill & @0xmigi\n\n**Date:** 09-25-2023\n\n---\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in the TEMP CHECK: Continue Aave Grants Proposal. This is an updated proposal based on the feedback that was received. The main changes that has been made from the previous proposal are:\n\n* The Events & Sponsorship budget and activities have been removed.\n* Swapping the AAVE portion of funding with stables.\n* Introducing a $20k max grant size.\n\n# Summary\n\nAn opportunity to continue Aave Grants DAO (AGD) for 6 months by preserving the current AGD treasury holdings, providing $400,000 of new funding in ARB, and increasing AGD’s stablecoin allowance by $328,000.\n\nThis proposal will enable AGD to deliver and improve upon the top tier grants program the Aave ecosystem has had over the past 2+ years and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem. AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.\n\n# Overview\n\nThroughout the previous proposal, AGD has:\n\n* Awarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.\n\n* Engaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.\n\n* Proliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.\n\n* Exercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.\n\nThis proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:\n\n* Providing new funding of $400,000 in ARB (~18% of the total ARB received by Aave DAO)\n\n* Increasing AGD’s stablecoin allowance by $328,000.\n\n# History\n\n![Timeline|1280x490](upload://8UmNLA3q2rDe51LE1bpp2iCpUOh.jpeg)\n\nSince its inception in May 2021, AGD has awarded $4,852,753 across 249 grants.\n\nFrom the last AGD proposal in January 2023 to now, AGD has awarded 50 grants and awarded 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties across four different hackathons.\n\n*Note: All $ cost amounts are calculated at time of payment, pre/post token value fluctuations are not included unless otherwise specified. Pending payments are not included.\n\nThis is the fifth proposal for AGD:\n\n* The[ initial proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-community-grants-program/3642) launched AGD in May 2021 with $1 million of total funding over two quarters.\n\n* The[ second proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-update-and-renewal/6371) was executed at the end of December 2021 and funded AGD for three months with $2 million of funding.\n\n* The[ third proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-grants-dao-update-and-renewal/7842) was executed at the end of May 2022 and funded AGD for six months with $3 million per quarter.\n\n* The[ fourth proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-aave-grants-dao-renewal/11289) was executed at the end of January 2023 and funded AGD for six months with $1.625 million per quarter.\n\n# Mission\n\nAGD is a community-led grants program that supports the growth of the Aave ecosystem by:\n\n(1) Funding innovative projects backed by strong teams with creative ideas that benefit and strengthen the Aave ecosystem through products and initiatives which:\n\n* Increase TVL or other protocol metrics\n\n* Expand the capabilities of the platform and utility of Aave\n\n* Empower the community with accessible and novel insights\n\n* Engage new users and enhance retention of current users\n\n* Grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity\n\nAND\n\n(2) Fostering a strong and inclusive culture around Aave. Aave's culture leads to:\n\n* Attracting and retaining the best contributors, and\n\n* Encouraging the development of new and creative solutions to key areas in the Aave protocol and Aave DAO.\n\n# Metrics\n\n**Grants Provided:**\n\n* Since May 2021: 249 grants worth $4,845,753\n\n* Since Jan 2023: 50 grants worth $885,020\n\n* Breakdown of grants by category:\n\n  * Category - $cumulative cost - number approved\n\n  * Applications and integrations - $2,664,556 - 108 grants\n\n  * Code audits - $82,000 - 3 grants\n\n  * Committees & DAOs that serve Aave’s ecosystem - $703,780 - 18 grants\n\n  * Community (marketing and educational) - $698,550 - 52 grants\n\n  * Developer tooling - $415,000 - 13 grants\n\n  * Events / Hackathons / Sponsorships - $185,000 - 14 grants\n\n  * Other - $294,900 - 12 grants\n\n  * Protocol development - $474,200 - 21 grants\n\n**Status of all Grant Projects Awarded:**\n\n* Complete/Live - 67.6%\n\n* In-progress - 24.8%\n\n* Inactive - 7.6%\n\n**Growth in Community Engagement Since Last Renewal Proposal (Jan 2023):**\n\n* Substack subscribers: 1,748 → 1,805 (+ 3%)\n\n* Twitter followers: 13,300 → 13,400 (+ 0.75%)\n\n* Telegram members: 643 → 719 (+ 12%)\n\n* Lens followers: 2,828 → 8,801 (+ 211%)\n\n* Mirror subscribers: 169 → 546 (+ 223%)\n\n**Key Stats Since Inception:**\n\n* Participated in 14 hackathons, awarding $150,000 in Aave and GHO specific bounties to 58 teams.\n\n  * Many of these teams have continued building or contributing to Aave and GHO, including five projects that went on to receive grants.\n\n* Achieved a Net Promoter Score, a measurement to gauge the experience of grantees, of 83 based on 77 responses.\n\n  * Average response to “How likely are you to recommend AGD?” is 4.8/5.\n\n* Processed 1,944 applications with an average turnaround time from application submission to grant decision of 9.6 days, shrinking over time.\n\n* Consistently accepted applications and awarded grants to builders:\n\n![AGD Proposal Received Since Inception - As of Sept 4 2023|2000x368](upload://n03ZA93GH9RxzfcLaBSYBdBnLoX.jpeg)\n\n![Grants accepted by quarter - As of Sept 4 2023|2000x371](upload://za6UB8Bgrv5fm25iKl2Zb0ePqZw.jpeg)\n\n# Since the Last Proposal\n\nThe community has been kept up to date with AGD’s[ activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-recent-work-updates/11585), the[ Halfway Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/agd-renewal-4-april-2023-halfway-updates/13683), and through AGD being added to[ Llama’s treasury dashboard](https://community.llama.xyz/aave/grants). The [AGD website](https://aavegrants.org/) houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.\n\nThe GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.\n\n## AGD Budget\n\nAGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,450,895. Part of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.\n\n![Average Grant Size Over Time.png|1606x984](upload://A28z92ug5DZZaQFNkv39J3DBzU5.jpeg)\n\nHere is a breakdown of AGD’s spend versus what was budgeted:\n\n![Budgeted vs Spent|1280x395](upload://yxP25hD2WEZRrNTbH6wYOefQMG1.jpeg)\n\nHere is AGD’s spend over the course of the previous proposal:\n\n![Q6 & Q7 Breakdown|1280x485](upload://uwGvstmQoJAemBhNw11vhTndBLi.jpeg)\n\n## Other Initiatives\n\n* **Increasing Grantee Accountability.** There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently [Defi Simulator](https://governance.aave.com/t/introduction-defi-simulator/13166), [Projection Finance](https://governance.aave.com/t/introduction-blockchain-education-network-aave-tutorials-learning-content/14448), and [Aave Alarm](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-mobile-notifier-app/14082)) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.\n\n* **‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs).** [A pilot project has been introduced](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-request-for-grants-by-aave-grants-dao-gho-governance-op/14125) to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.\n\n* **AGD Operations and Best Practices.** Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:\n\n![Process|1280x466](upload://AbmHHvqATIWjmJubiH87yZgGKvX.jpeg)\n\n# Grantee Highlights\n\nSince AGD’s last proposal, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.\n\n![Grants by Category|1280x856](upload://p42bwb2ZXMR7EZCIoR8rgS3v76B.jpeg)\n\nHere are some recent highlights from grantees:\n\n**[Dullahan](https://dullahan.paladin.vote/)**\n\nDesigned and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and has over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.\n\n**[Sommelier Finance](https://app.sommelier.finance/strategies/Real-Yield-ETH/manage)**\n\nEnables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.\n\n**[AAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools](https://dapp.cian.app/strategy/maticleveraged/create)**\n\nExpands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.\n\nOther applications include: [DeFi Simulator](https://defisim.xyz/), [Aave Alarm](https://github.com/nebolax/aavealarm), [Projection Finance](https://aavev3.projection.finance/) and [Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard](https://aave.karmahq.xyz/).\n\n**[IntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO](https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/metrics/ethereum/aave_gho)**\n\nHelps the community understand GHO's activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.\n\n**[Xenophon Labs](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-raising-the-safety-module-s-slashing-percentage/14167)**\n\nPerformed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year\n\n**[Butter](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732/19)**\n\nFacilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.\n\n**[Senate](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb5da30d8d949c3f00f4a34cd68cdddba9e64dfaf47f75ab3bd8d164fcd001279)**\n\nReducing the friction of engaging with Aave governance by implementing their notification and alert system in the governance forum.\n\n**[Flexible aToken Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting/blob/master/src/ATokenFlexVoting.sol)** ScopeLift\n\nUnlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.\n\n**[AwesomeQA](https://home.awesomeqa.xyz/)**\n\nStreamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.\n\n# Operational Focuses for this Proposal\n\nThe path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:\n\n**Finish Establishing Legal Entity**\n\nEstablishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.\n\nAGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.\n\n**Revamping Review Committee**\n\nAGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. [One idea AGD will explore](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-further-decentralising-the-aave-grants-dao/14452/22) is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.\n\n**AGD and Service Provider Alignment**\n\nWith the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.\n\n**Measuring Impact**\n\nAGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as [Spindl](https://www.spindl.xyz/) to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.\n\nStarting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.\n\n# People\n\nAGD now has ten members.\n\n* Lead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.\n\n* Review Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:\n\n* Corbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys\n\n* Calvin Chu - Impossible Finance\n\n* Francis Gowen - Flipside Crypto\n\n* Lawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics\n\n* Kakashi - Symphony\n\n* Andrew Allen - Coinbase\n\n* David Truong - [x23.ai](https://x23.ai/), ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev\n\n* Operations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.\n\n* Analyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.\n\n**Compensation:**\n\n* Lead: $9k/month\n\n* Review committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week\n\n  * Reviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.\n\n* Analyst: $5k/month\n\n* Operations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month\n\n* Designer and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements\n\nThe roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.\n\n# Proposed Budgets\n\nThis proposal's total budget will be split between a Grants Budget, an Events & Sponsorship Budget, and an Operations Budget. In total across all three budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:\n\n* $400,000 in ARB\n\n* $328,000 increase in AGD’s stablecoin allowance\n\nThis would make AGD's treasury, including allowances 64.6% in stables, 11.5% in AAVE, and 23.9% in ARB & OP.\n\n$292,000 that was previously allocated to 'Digital Marketing' spend has been reallocated to this budget.\n\nNotably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to [swap AGD's DAI allowance with GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-replace-agd-s-dai-allowance-with-gho-allowance/14631). AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.\n\n## Grants Budget\n\n|                    \t| Carry Forward | Ask    \t| Tokens for Ask |\n|------------------------|---------------|------------|----------------|\n| Developer Grants   \t| $614,980  \t| $300,000   | Stables    \t|\n|                    \t| $133,000  \t| $0     \t| OP         \t|\n|                    \t| $0        \t| $400,000   | ARB        \t|\n| **Grants Total Budgeted Cost** | **$747,980**\t| **$700,000**   |            \t|\n\n\n\nThe OP is based on the 100,000 OP[ allocated to AGD during the previous proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-allocation-of-300k-op-received-by-aave-grants-dao/12820). In line with the total amount of OP AGD has (300,000 OP), AGD is requesting $400,000 in ARB tokens to support the growth and development of projects building on top of Aave on Arbitrum. This is equivalent to ~18% of the total ARB received (at current prices) and is in line with the[ community’s preference](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xea8b9cc41076ba43c8a66dfd40ce539b3126af049639babce6c1fa3e62585b79) to allocate the full amount of ARB received across multiple options. Any ARB unspent during this proposal will be kept in the AGD treasury and allocated to future proposals.\n\nAGD will introduce a new $20k max grant size for all grants and double down on kickstarting the growth of new teams building on top of Aave and GHO.\n\n## Operations Budget\n\n|                                             \t| Carry Forward | Ask   \t| Tokens for Ask |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Compensation                                \t| $20,150   \t| $300,000  | Stables    \t|\n| Maintenance: Tooling, subscriptions, gas reimbursements | $526     \t| $20,000   | Stables    \t|\n| Legal Buffer                                \t| $69,984   \t| $0    \t|    \t|\n| **Operations Total Budgeted Cost**          \t| **$90,660**   | **$320,000** |            \t|\n\n\nIncreasing the overall amount allocated to operations, especially compensation, is necessary for AGD to grow its resources and operate more independently.\n\n\n# Next Steps\n\n* Get community feedback on TEMP CHECK\n\n* **Snapshot vote** <- we are here\n\n* If Snapshot is successful then move to AIP",

        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Aave Chan Initiative 6-Month Budget Proposal",
        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is a delegate platform dedicated to actively participating in Aave governance and contributing to the protocol's success. As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward.\n\nTo continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact.\n\n## **ACI's current & future areas of focus**\n\n1. **Governance and AIP Development**\n    - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes\n    - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs\n    - Engaging with the community on forum discussions\n    - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders\n2. **Treasury Efficiency and Management**\n    - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management.\n    - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors.\n    - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation.\n    - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users.\n3. **Protocol and Ecosystem Development**\n    - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs\n    - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis)\n    - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral\n    - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for “Real Yield” revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO\n    - Support the expansion of Aave markets in “new Frontiers” networks\n4. **Research and Analysis**\n    - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments\n    - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community\n    - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions\n    - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n5. **Team Expansion and Operations**\n    - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better\n    - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure\n    - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement\n    - Start a “Meta-Governance” focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered “Aave-Maximalist,” there’s a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other “professional” delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem.\n6. **Independence & Transparency**\n    - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power.\n   - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol.\n   - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely.\n   - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO.\n\n## **Previous Work**\n\nHere are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative:\n\n- **Governance Coordination**: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly **ZERO** AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022.\n- **AIPs**: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave.\n    \n- **Governance improvement**: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible.\n- **Delegators & contributor coordination:** The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous “co-authorship” synergies with other DAO actors.\n\n## **Requested Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us:\n\n- Sustainably continue our current work\n- Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work\n- Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the “One-Man Army” meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation\n- Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem\n\nBy securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposal's specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal.\nWe commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal. We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to drive the success of the Aave protocol.",

        "body": "Author: [@Michigan_Blockchain](https://governance.aave.com/u/michigan_blockchain) - Michigan Blockchain, [@Isha](https://governance.aave.com/u/isha) - Isha Varshney (Celo Foundation)\n\nDate: 2023-08-14\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check aims to provide general background information on the Celo blockchain and seeks the community’s input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Celo, an emerging [L2 on Ethereum 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109).\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs detailed in the Background section below, the Celo ecosystem offers a unique value proposition featuring real-world usage and ReFi. As Aave will be given a prominent role on Celo, this deployment offers Aave differentiated expansion and revenue opportunities.\n\n1. A deployment on Celo expands AAVE’s utility and user base to a unique population of Celo’s mobile-first community which has [grown significantly](https://dune.com/springzhang/celo-blockchain-overview) over the past few months led by key launches that have brought in returning real-world users in emerging markets.\n2. Aave will be heavily utilized for real-world DeFi and ReFi use cases, particularly in emerging markets given Celo’s growing presence in these regions led by protocols like GoodDollar and Grassroots Economics.\n3. **The Celo Foundation will allocated 0.5% of CELO circulating supply as an incentive for Aave users to support the adoption and bootstrap growth on Celo.** This deployment will bring new users to the Aave platform and reach more users from the Celo community. The Celo Foundation can also support Aave DAO in setting up a verified node for the Celo network (subject to technical requirements being met and voting by the community) for which Celo can provide a grant.\n4. The [Mento protocol](https://www.mento.org/) on Celo proposed returning 120M CELO to the Celo Community Fund, which the Celo community has expressed interest in placing in Aave to boost on-chain liquidity for CELO (pending a governance process). More details [here](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-reserve-returning-celo/5236). Additionally, they proposed a $10M CELO / wETH pool on Uniswap which is expected to pass through Celo governance.\n5. In the long-term, this Celo x AAVE deployment has the potential opportunity to expand into natural capital-backed assets such as tokenized carbon credit and other ReFi assets (conditional upon rigorous liquidity and credit assessments by Chaos Labs and others).\n\n## Background\n\nCelo is an open-source, mobile-first EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, on a mission to foster an inclusive financial system for everyone. With an ecosystem thriving on [9.4M addresses, around 1M daily transactions](https://celoscan.io/)[~500,000 monthly active wallets](https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/stats),[and over 234M transactions](https://celoscan.io/) since inception, Celo sets the stage for real-world applications from day one. Celo has been one of the fastest-growing blockchains over the past few months.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiba5l3pstp4vgvs5b5brdkg3omz6w5otp7gepzh5ycqdxrspbxv6m)\n\n**Source: Nansen**\n\n### **Key Features:**\n\n**Mobile Accessibility**: Utilizes a decentralized phone verification protocol and SNARK-based light clients such as Plumo 1 for mobile-friendly operations.\n\n**Flexible Assets**: Celo offers native stablecoins in the form of Mento stable assets (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL), which are eligible for transaction fees. CELO itself natively supports the ERC20 interface, eliminating the need for wrapped versions.\n\n**Regenerative Finance**: Committed to regenerative finance, Celo is carbon-negative, offsetting over eight times its carbon footprint. An upcoming proposal, the [Ultragreen Money](https://www.ultragreen.money/), looks to further push Celo’s green initiatives.\n\n**Real World Usage:** CELO TVL continues to grow and is at [193M CELO](https://defillama.com/chain/Celo?currency=CELO) showing continued locking of assets into Celo DeFi protocols. Additionally, Celo has been chosen by [Kickstarter](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/kickstarter-to-start-blockchain-based-crowdfunding-project-report/) for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over [214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)) and [Deutsche Telekom](https://blog.celo.org/celo-deutsche-telekoms-partnership-strengthens-with-the-global-launch-of-t-challenge-bd102f07b572) which will attract new users to the ecosystem.\n\nThe Celo ecosystem emphasizes real-world applications—real-world usage has been the core focus since day 1 of the blockchain. Several of the many solutions actively being used by people around the world on the Celo blockchain include the following:\n\n- UBI: GoodDollar has over [130,000 monthly beneficiaries 1](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/celo?period=month) around the world.\n- Community Currency: Grassroots Economics has [over 20,000 active users](https://viz.sarafu.network/) across Kenya and South Africa\n- Digital Microwork: The Celo Foundation initially piloted digital microwork with [Mercy Corps Ventures](https://www.mercycorps.org/research-resources/potential-cryptocurrency-kenya-youth) and today Jumptask has over [40,000 users](https://celoscan.io/token/0x1d18d0386f51ab03e7e84e71bda1681eba865f1f) on Celo\n- Climate action: [Plastiks](https://plastiks.io/) recently partnered with FC Barcelona on a [climate-focused NFT launch](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/3505122/fc-barcelona-launches-its-first-nft-collection-in-association-with-plastiks) and [Ecosapiens](https://www.ecosapiens.xyz/) debuted their new [enterprise climate collectible](https://nftnow.com/news/exclusive-ecosapiens-debuts-corporate-climate-collectibles-on-celo/) on Celo. [Toucan](https://toucan.earth/) protocol, [Carbonpath](https://www.carbonpath.io/), and [CarbonTerra](https://carbonterra.com/) offer on chain carbon credit retirements. Additionally, the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) continues to remain a leader in the industry driving web3 solutions for solving the climate crisis.\n- Real-world lending: [EthicHub](https://www.ethichub.com/en/) supports 21 smallholder farming communities in Mexico, Brazil, and Honduras for uncollateralized lending. The [Credit Collective](https://forum.celo.org/t/credit-collective-hello-world/5789) is currently seeding liquidity into new impact-driven lending and RWA protocols on Celo with members including [impactMarket 1](https://www.impactmarket.com/), [Flowcarbon](https://www.flowcarbon.com/), [Huma Finance 1](https://huma.finance/), and [Canza Finance](https://canza.io/).\n- Native mobile offramps: Through [FiatConnect 1](https://fiatconnect.org/), an API standard for web3 wallets to integrate with cash-in/cash-out providers, Celo users will be able to natively onramp and offramp through mobile wallets. In its initial activation, [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) wallet users across 20 countries can now leverage this technology.\n- Social impact and mobile gaming: The Celo Foundation partnered with [Animoca](https://www.animocabrands.com/animoca-brands-joins-celo-ecosystem-to-accelerate-web3-adoption) on mobile-first and social impact gaming. Engagements include Animoca serving as a validator and [climate education](https://twitter.com/TinyTapAB/status/1684485236200026112) with [TinyTap](https://www.start.tinytap.com/publisher-nft).\n\n**Integration with Ethereum**: cLabs recently [proposed 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109) that Celo return home to Ethereum by transitioning from an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2. Following months of research by the cLabs team as well as initial discussions among core Celo and Ethereum community members, the cLabs team detailed an architecture in which the Celo blockchain becomes an Ethereum L2, with key differentiators including\n\n- Decentralized sequencer powered by Celo’s existing validator set running Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus.\n- Off-chain data availability layer, powered by EigenLayer and EigenDA, operated by Ethereum node operators, and protected by restaked ETH. EigenDA brings the design of danksharding to Ethereum early, enabling Celo to maintain its low fees.\n- A design that retains Celo’s 1-block finality.\n\nThis proposal was [overwhelmingly approved](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/116) by the Celo ecosystem in a temperature check to continue this work.\n\n**Security**: The chain consensus is Proof of Stake with validators taking delegation. There is no multisignature contract that can change the network. On-chain governance proposals and hard-forks are the only ways to make changes to the network. The Smart Contract was audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/celo-contracts-audit/) and a Security Audit was conducted by [Trailofbits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PEjoN_wn--OWwzOcolAUGimBjqFjEecNSSQwL6i0y3Q/edit). There is also a formal verification of Celo governance protocols by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CeloMay2020.pdf).\n\n**Native Mobile Solutions**: [FiatConnect 1](https://fiatconnect.org/) allows Celo users to natively handle onramps and offramps through mobile wallets in multiple countries.\n\nEmphasizing global utility, Celo has been a touchstone for decentralized solutions worldwide. From UBI, community currencies, and digital microwork, to climate action, Celo propels web3 solutions with a real-world impact.\n\nFor a detailed dive, head over to https://docs.celo.org/.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nChaos Labs advised us on initial parameter recommendations, given the current liquidity levels on Celo. **Please note that these recommendations would be updated closer to launch.** We encourage other risk managers for updated analyses post temperature check. Crucially, the metrics below **do not** include a [governance proposal 1](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/121) in which $10M of liquidity is proposed by the Celo ecosystem for a CELO / wETH pool on Uniswap.\n\nBased on current liquidity levels, **we believe a Metis-type of initial deployment would be most suitable—the emphasis here being the Celo blockchain’s real-world and social impact use cases**. Over time, we expect we can continue to increase caps as the Celo blockchain grows through the development of more real-world use cases and the transition to an L2 on Ethereum.\n\n| Risk Parameters | WETH | USDC | CELO | cUSD |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | YES |\n| Enable Borrow | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | NO | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 75% | N/A | 70% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 80% | N/A | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% | 5% | N/A | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% | 15% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | 110 | 880,000 | 60,000 | 3,400,000 |\n| Supply Cap | 140 | 1,100,000 | 80,000 | 4,300,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | TBD |\n| uOptimal | 80% | 80% | 45% | 75% |\n| Base | 1% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 3.8% | 4% | 7% | 7% |\n| Slope2 | 80% | 60% | 300% | 75% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Stable Slope1 | 13.00% | 13.00% | 13.00% | 13.00% |\n| Stable Slope2 | 300.00% | 300.00% | 300.00% | 300.00% |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset | 3.00% | 3.00% | 3.00% | 3.00% |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00% | 5.00% | 5.00% | 5.00% |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00% | 20.00% | 20.00% | 20.00% |\n| Flashloanable | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Siloed Borrowing | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | NO | YES | NO | NO |\n\n**Oracle:** Chainlink recently deployed on Celo as part of the Chainlink SCALE Program.\n\n**Cross-chain Interactions**: Celo has integrations with token bridges like [Portal (Wormhole)](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer), [Allbridge](https://allbridge.io/classic/), and [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/)–along with cross-chain messaging partners including [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/), [Hyperlane](https://www.hyperlane.xyz/), [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/), and [Axelar](https://axelar.network/).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided above about Celo is from public sources and Michigan Blockchain cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.\n\nThe Celo Foundation has been collaborating with Michigan Blockchain to work through the details of this proposed deployment and communicate the merits to the broader Aave community.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] TokenLogic Proposal \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-08-25\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication present the Aave Community the opportunity to onboard TokenLogic as a service provider. TokenLogic shall focus on Aave DAO finances and support GHO adoption.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nMembers of the TokenLogic team have been contributing to Aave Protocol since mid 2020. More recently, the team has been expanding in preparation to better support our three focus areas:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* Safety Module modelling\n* GHO Adoption\n\nTokenLogic is a developer focused team with a proven track recorded dating back to March 2023 when the delegation platform was annouced. During this time we have delivered the following:\n\n* 5 AIPs, 6 payloads, several GHO related BIPs\n* [GHO liquidity pools analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n* Coordinated [7.7%](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071) veBAL support for GHO's launch\n* Stoodup an analytics platform \n* Launch of [GHO Analytics frontend](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n\nThe team is growing and we onboarded an accounting team to start developing a Aave Financial Reporting (genesis to date) frontend, launch date mid/late Q4 2023.\n\n# Current & Future Areas of Focus\n\n The below provides a high level overview of our **key focus** areas:\n\n* **Treasury Management**\n    * Improving the risk adjusted return of DAO's assets\n        * Aave v2 to v3 migrations\n        * Swap long tail assets to ETH / stable coins\n    * Improving capital efficiency\n        * Convert wMATIC to MaticX & stMATIC\n    * Managing strategic assets\n        * Upgrades to Strategic Asset Manager v1 functionality as required\n    * Modelling asset purchase / bribe\n        * Participate in Quest/Bribe v acquiring asset\n    * Engage, collaborate and support community lead initiatives\n        * Example: How best to optimise CRV holding\n    * Oversee Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) deployment\n        * If DAO elects to provide POL, ensure Boost is directed to holding to optimise returns and maintain the strategy through claiming and swapping/locking rewards.\n    * Design and create a contract for managing DAO's POL\n        * Perform swaps, claim incentives, transfer assets etc...\n    * Claim Aave Protocol revenue fees at the end of each month\n        * This bot is currently operated by Llama\n\n* **GHO Liquidity / Incentives Management**\n    * Create Liquidity Management Committee / Budget\n        * Provide modelling to support Committee decision making\n    * Liquidity Incentive Optimisation Analysis (Strategic Assets)\n        * Target pool sizes & APRs \n    * Explore synergies with Safety Module diversification\n        * Potential to include GHO liquidity pools\n        * We will lead this effort after Llama's contract finishes\n* **Financial Reporting**\n    * Runway forecast\n        * Specifically tracking asset balance and drawdown rates to show when other assets require being swapped to fund the DAO\n    * Budget and resource allocation\n        * Work with ACI and others to develop a DAO budget\n    * Transparent accurate, third party reviewed, accessible financial statments\n        * Launch a financial statment frontend mid/late Q4 2023\n        * Cover Ethereum, Polygon (PoS), Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche initially and expand over time.\n        * Quarterly financial publications \n    * Revenue per Reserve v time charts\n        * Daily or Hourly data showing revenue being generated per Reserve on each Aave v2 and v3 iteration\n        * Users will be able to select an asset and see total revenue noiminated in the underlying or select an instance of Aave and a specific asset.\n        * Data will be displayed graphically with some ability to interact with the charts\n* **Supporting GHO Adoption**\n    * Collaborate with other teams to support GHO adoption\n        * Promote utility and velocity\n    * Continual development of GHO Analytics frontend\n    * Promote adoption through DeFi integrations\n        * Examples include working with teams to build real yield strategies, structured products and list GHO as collateral\n* **Safety Module Improvements**\n    * Model the SM performance during shortfall events\n        * Create a frontend that show historical performance for swapping certain amounts of each asset instantly (not dutch auction) via an aggregator\n    * Model / forecast emission budget\n        * AAVE emissions are finite, GHO is better\n        * Capital efficiency could be improved through adoption of quests and/or acquiring assets that control the emission schedule of another protocol\n    * Advocate for diversification and reducing the reward budget\n        * Introduction of stable coins, ETH and other assets to reduce reliance on AAVE during shortfall events\n    * Collaborate with others to refine to enhance the SM's effectiveness at providing a backstop for Aave Protocol\n        * BGD to implement on-chain upgrades\n        * Model liquidity pool assets to be added to SM\n        * Work with ACI, BGD, Llama and others to determine a target coverage, implementation of proposals and refine the asset blend\n\nEach of the areas detailed above is interwoven and has a material affect on the DAO's financial status. TokenLogic is committed to working with other DAO contributors collaboratively and constructively to better the Aave Protocol. \n\nTo support the initiatives aboves, we have created an analytics platform. The GHO dashboard is our first analytics initiative. Beyond GHO, we plan on using the analytics platform to provide the DAO with near live revenue data stream for each asset reserve on supported networks. We seek to always incorporate community feedback and build out any requests from the community.\n\nOur team is very well connected across defi and we intend to support Aave and GHO where ever we can. To this end, we are already working with several teams looking to integrate GHO and have been working with @0xbilll at AGD with targeted spending initiatives.\n\nTo ensure continuation of active work scopes, TokenLogic will continue to manage the migration of users on Polygon v2 to v3. This includes either fortnightly or monthly parameter adjustments. We encourage another service provider to pick up the Avalanche v2 migration. However, if required, we are happy to support provided it doesn't impact our key focus ares which we will be measure against.\n\n# Prior Work\n\nThis section, we will focus on what TokenLogic has delivered to Aave DAO:\n\n* [TokenLogic Delegate Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n* Asset Listings\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX to Aave V3 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-to-aave-v3-ethereum/13051)\n    * [[AIP] Add FRAX Ethereum Aave v3](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/260/)\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX Arbitrum Aave v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-arbitrum-aave-v3/13222)\n    * [[AIP] Add ARB to Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/273/)\n* GHO Liquidity\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] GHO Liquidity Pools](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655)\n    * [[ARFC] GHO Liquidity Pools: Primary Pools Initial Strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n    * Coordinated veBAL and vlAURA support for the launch of GHO\n* GHO Analytics Dashboard\n    * https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/\n* GHO Yield Strategy\n    * Supported **Sommelier** with development of real yield strategies that manage GHO liquidity across several DEXs. Current at audit stage.\n    * Worked with **Beefy Finance** to launch several farming strategies that utilise Balancer GHO liquidity pools\n* Sunseting Polygon v2 - Via [Butter Incentivized Delegate Campaign](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732)\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] Polygon v2 to v3 Liquidity Migration](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350)\n   * [[ARFC] Polygon v2 - Parameter Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-polygon-v2-parameter-update/12817)\n    * [[AIP] Polygon v2 - Parameter Update](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/250/)\n    * [[AIP] Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=284)\n* Supply Cap Increase\n    * [[ARFC] Supply Cap - stMATIC Polygon](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-supply-cap-stmatic-polygon/14355)\n    * [[AIP] Supply Cap Update - stMATIC Polygon v3](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=300)\n* Polygon v2 Treasury to v3 Migration\n    * [[Payload] Treasury Management - Polygon v2 to v3 Migration](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/267) \n    * [[AIP] Treasury Management - Polygon v2 to v3 Migration](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=303)\n* Avalanche v2 Treasury to v3 Migration\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Avalanche v2 to v3 Migration](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-avalanche-v2-to-v3-migration/14218)\n    * [[ARFC] Treasury Management - Avalanche v2 to v3 Migration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-avalanche-v2-to-v3-migration/14469)\n\nThere are also several gauge proposals presented on the Balancer governance forum and even BPT asset listing proposals on Sturdy Finance that support GHO's launch and depositing funds into Aave v3 respectively.\n\nDelivering the above work has enabled TokenLogic to grow the team beyond @MatthewGraham and @DeFiJesus, to include @Dydymoon, @scottincrypto, @agentmak and TBA (soon). With several developers, strategists and accountants apart the team, we are mostly manned up and ready to take on a more involved service provider scope. \n\n# Budget\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of 350,000 USD for an initial 6 month period to support our initiatives.\n\nThis budget will contribute to covering operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure plus the resources required to deliver our work.\n\nThe payment terms are as shown below:\n\nUpfront Transfer: ~~210,000~~ 0 GHO\nStream: ~~140,000~~ 350,000 GHO\n\nThis is a ~~60/40~~ 0/100 split of upfront/streamed.\n\nAddress: `eth:0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nSimilar to ACI, TokenLogic is to be included in the [Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gas-rebate-for-recognized-delegates/13290) program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts and deployment costs.\n\nTokenLogic commits to not receiving any funds from other entities for creating proposals and publishing AIPs on Aave Protocol.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nThe below provides an overview of how the DAO can assess TokenLogic's performance:\n\n* Migrate Aave DAO funds from v2 to v3\n* Create Liquidity Committee with funding\n* Optimise GHO liquidity incentives \n* Strategic Assets are being actively used\n* Runway funding sustained (>6 months of the correct assets)\n* Convert Treasury assets to LSTs\n* Launch financial statement frontend\n* Continual flow of new GHO Dashboard features\n\nAs DAOs are dynamic, when more urgent priorities emerge TokenLogic will support and proactively work with other service providers to act in Aave's best interest. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf the [TEMP CHECK] is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal [ARFC] submission to governance.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining transparency throughout the process and providing regular updates the community on our progress.\n\nWe thank everyone for considering our proposal and appreciate your support. We look forward to working together and driving success to the Aave Protocol.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
