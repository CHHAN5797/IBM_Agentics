        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] TokenLogic Proposal \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-08-25\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication present the Aave Community the opportunity to onboard TokenLogic as a service provider. TokenLogic shall focus on Aave DAO finances and support GHO adoption.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nMembers of the TokenLogic team have been contributing to Aave Protocol since mid 2020. More recently, the team has been expanding in preparation to better support our three focus areas:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* Safety Module modelling\n* GHO Adoption\n\nTokenLogic is a developer focused team with a proven track recorded dating back to March 2023 when the delegation platform was annouced. During this time we have delivered the following:\n\n* 5 AIPs, 6 payloads, several GHO related BIPs\n* [GHO liquidity pools analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n* Coordinated [7.7%](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071) veBAL support for GHO's launch\n* Stoodup an analytics platform \n* Launch of [GHO Analytics frontend](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n\nThe team is growing and we onboarded an accounting team to start developing a Aave Financial Reporting (genesis to date) frontend, launch date mid/late Q4 2023.\n\n# Current & Future Areas of Focus\n\n The below provides a high level overview of our **key focus** areas:\n\n* **Treasury Management**\n    * Improving the risk adjusted return of DAO's assets\n        * Aave v2 to v3 migrations\n        * Swap long tail assets to ETH / stable coins\n    * Improving capital efficiency\n        * Convert wMATIC to MaticX & stMATIC\n    * Managing strategic assets\n        * Upgrades to Strategic Asset Manager v1 functionality as required\n    * Modelling asset purchase / bribe\n        * Participate in Quest/Bribe v acquiring asset\n    * Engage, collaborate and support community lead initiatives\n        * Example: How best to optimise CRV holding\n    * Oversee Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) deployment\n        * If DAO elects to provide POL, ensure Boost is directed to holding to optimise returns and maintain the strategy through claiming and swapping/locking rewards.\n    * Design and create a contract for managing DAO's POL\n        * Perform swaps, claim incentives, transfer assets etc...\n    * Claim Aave Protocol revenue fees at the end of each month\n        * This bot is currently operated by Llama\n\n* **GHO Liquidity / Incentives Management**\n    * Create Liquidity Management Committee / Budget\n        * Provide modelling to support Committee decision making\n    * Liquidity Incentive Optimisation Analysis (Strategic Assets)\n        * Target pool sizes & APRs \n    * Explore synergies with Safety Module diversification\n        * Potential to include GHO liquidity pools\n        * We will lead this effort after Llama's contract finishes\n* **Financial Reporting**\n    * Runway forecast\n        * Specifically tracking asset balance and drawdown rates to show when other assets require being swapped to fund the DAO\n    * Budget and resource allocation\n        * Work with ACI and others to develop a DAO budget\n    * Transparent accurate, third party reviewed, accessible financial statments\n        * Launch a financial statment frontend mid/late Q4 2023\n        * Cover Ethereum, Polygon (PoS), Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche initially and expand over time.\n        * Quarterly financial publications \n    * Revenue per Reserve v time charts\n        * Daily or Hourly data showing revenue being generated per Reserve on each Aave v2 and v3 iteration\n        * Users will be able to select an asset and see total revenue noiminated in the underlying or select an instance of Aave and a specific asset.\n        * Data will be displayed graphically with some ability to interact with the charts\n* **Supporting GHO Adoption**\n    * Collaborate with other teams to support GHO adoption\n        * Promote utility and velocity\n    * Continual development of GHO Analytics frontend\n    * Promote adoption through DeFi integrations\n        * Examples include working with teams to build real yield strategies, structured products and list GHO as collateral\n* **Safety Module Improvements**\n    * Model the SM performance during shortfall events\n        * Create a frontend that show historical performance for swapping certain amounts of each asset instantly (not dutch auction) via an aggregator\n    * Model / forecast emission budget\n        * AAVE emissions are finite, GHO is better\n        * Capital efficiency could be improved through adoption of quests and/or acquiring assets that control the emission schedule of another protocol\n    * Advocate for diversification and reducing the reward budget\n        * Introduction of stable coins, ETH and other assets to reduce reliance on AAVE during shortfall events\n    * Collaborate with others to refine to enhance the SM's effectiveness at providing a backstop for Aave Protocol\n        * BGD to implement on-chain upgrades\n        * Model liquidity pool assets to be added to SM\n        * Work with ACI, BGD, Llama and others to determine a target coverage, implementation of proposals and refine the asset blend\n\nEach of the areas detailed above is interwoven and has a material affect on the DAO's financial status. TokenLogic is committed to working with other DAO contributors collaboratively and constructively to better the Aave Protocol. \n\nTo support the initiatives aboves, we have created an analytics platform. The GHO dashboard is our first analytics initiative. Beyond GHO, we plan on using the analytics platform to provide the DAO with near live revenue data stream for each asset reserve on supported networks. We seek to always incorporate community feedback and build out any requests from the community.\n\nOur team is very well connected across defi and we intend to support Aave and GHO where ever we can. To this end, we are already working with several teams looking to integrate GHO and have been working with @0xbilll at AGD with targeted spending initiatives.\n\nTo ensure continuation of active work scopes, TokenLogic will continue to manage the migration of users on Polygon v2 to v3. This includes either fortnightly or monthly parameter adjustments. We encourage another service provider to pick up the Avalanche v2 migration. However, if required, we are happy to support provided it doesn't impact our key focus ares which we will be measure against.\n\n# Prior Work\n\nThis section, we will focus on what TokenLogic has delivered to Aave DAO:\n\n* [TokenLogic Delegate Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n* Asset Listings\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX to Aave V3 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-to-aave-v3-ethereum/13051)\n    * [[AIP] Add FRAX Ethereum Aave v3](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/260/)\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX Arbitrum Aave v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-arbitrum-aave-v3/13222)\n    * [[AIP] Add ARB to Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/273/)\n* GHO Liquidity\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] GHO Liquidity Pools](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655)\n    * [[ARFC] GHO Liquidity Pools: Primary Pools Initial Strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n    * Coordinated veBAL and vlAURA support for the launch of GHO\n* GHO Analytics Dashboard\n    * https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/\n* GHO Yield Strategy\n    * Supported **Sommelier** with development of real yield strategies that manage GHO liquidity across several DEXs.

With several developers, strategists and accountants apart the team, we are mostly manned up and ready to take on a more involved service provider scope. \n\n# Budget\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of 350,000 USD for an initial 6 month period to support our initiatives.\n\nThis budget will contribute to covering operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure plus the resources required to deliver our work.\n\nThe payment terms are as shown below:\n\nUpfront Transfer: ~~210,000~~ 0 GHO\nStream: ~~140,000~~ 350,000 GHO\n\nThis is a ~~60/40~~ 0/100 split of upfront/streamed.\n\nAddress: `eth:0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nSimilar to ACI, TokenLogic is to be included in the [Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gas-rebate-for-recognized-delegates/13290) program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts and deployment costs.\n\nTokenLogic commits to not receiving any funds from other entities for creating proposals and publishing AIPs on Aave Protocol.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nThe below provides an overview of how the DAO can assess TokenLogic's performance:\n\n* Migrate Aave DAO funds from v2 to v3\n* Create Liquidity Committee with funding\n* Optimise GHO liquidity incentives \n* Strategic Assets are being actively used\n* Runway funding sustained (>6 months of the correct assets)\n* Convert Treasury assets to LSTs\n* Launch financial statement frontend\n* Continual flow of new GHO Dashboard features\n\nAs DAOs are dynamic, when more urgent priorities emerge TokenLogic will support and proactively work with other service providers to act in Aave's best interest. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf the [TEMP CHECK] is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal [ARFC] submission to governance.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining transparency throughout the process and providing regular updates the community on our progress.\n\nWe thank everyone for considering our proposal and appreciate your support. We look forward to working together and driving success to the Aave Protocol.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Add KNC to Ethereum Aave V3",
        "author": "0x57ab7ee15cE5ECacB1aB84EE42D5A9d0d8112922",
        "body": "This proposal seeks to add KNC (Kyber Network Crystal) to Aave v3 on Ethereum.\n\nAuthors: Maxax; Shane\n\nDate: 12/09/2023\n\n## References\n\n* Project website: https://kyberswap.com/\n* Documentation: https://docs.kyberswap.com/\n* Github / source code: https://github.com/KyberNetwork\n* Ethereum contracts: [0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202)\n* Chainlink Oracle - KNC/USD Price Feed :[ 0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/knc-usd)\n\nAudits:\n\nBecause we are limited in the number of links, please find more information on our docs.\n\n* KyberDAO & KNC audit by Hacken\n* KyberSwap Elastic protocol audit by ChainSecurity\n* KyberSwap Classic protocol audit by ChainSecurity\n\n## Summary\n\nKyberSwap (Kyber Network’s flagship product) is a multi-chain DEX aggregator + concentrated liquidity platform, which aims to offer superior rates for traders and capital efficient returns for liquidity providers.\n\nKyber launched on Ethereum in February 2018 and is a pioneer in the DeFi space, developing one of the earliest decentralized exchange protocols (DEX) with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor. The team spearheaded the launch of WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) - the most popular ERC20 version of Bitcoin today (and a collateral asset on Aave V2 & V3), as well as developing liquidity pools on KyberSwap that offers concentrated liquidity and capital efficiency for any token pair. Kyber was the most used DeFi protocol in 2019 according to Binance Research and also part of the pioneer batch of Alliance DAO/DeFi Alliance mentors and Asia DeFi Network. Today, KyberSwap is one of the most popular DEX aggregators and liquidity platforms on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Base, and other chains.\n\nThis proposal aims to list the **[Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token]** as a supply and borrow collateral asset on Isolation Mode on Aave V3 Ethereum Market.\n\n## Motivations\n\nKyberSwap is one of the oldest and most popular DEX aggregators with an average of 500K web visitors per month. KyberSwap has already been deployed on 14 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and Base. Total trading volume has crossed $21B+ and current total value locked (TVL) on all chains is $60M+.\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on proposals to improve KyberSwap. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap and other ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated.\n\nKNC is a liquid asset with many token holders. KNC holders may want to obtain additional liquidity without selling KNC so that they can still capture potential upside in token value. With KNC supported on Aave, KNC holders can borrow funds e.g. GHO for a wide variety of DeFi use cases, such as margin trading or for new investment opportunities, all without selling their current holdings.\n\nWe are keen on a long-term, strategic relationship with Aave and adding KNC as a supply and borrow collateral asset in isolation mode is a good first step towards this objective.\n\n### Isolation mode\n\nAdding support for KNC on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow KNC holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their KNC position, attracting new KNC Deposits.\n\n### Specification\n\n**1- What is the link between the author of the TEMP CHECK and the Asset?**\n\nShane and Maxax are from the DAO & KNC Strategy team at Kyber Network, managing Kyber’s strategic efforts regarding the KyberDAO and KNC tokenomics for KNC holders.\n\nEmails: shane@kyber.network ; max@kyber.network Telegram: @shaneHk , @maxaxeth Twitter: shaneMkt, 0xmaxax\n\n**2- Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.**\n\nKyberSwap is Kyber Network's flagship product, a multi-chain DEX aggregator + liquidity platform offering optimal trade routes and returns for liquidity providers.\n\nBenefits\n\n* Traders: Enjoy superior swap rates as KyberSwap aggregates liquidity from various DEX pools, including KyberSwap's pools. KyberAI, an on-chain analytics tool created by the Kyberswap team, identifies potential trending tokens and trading opportunities, while providing insights into those tokens. Limit Orders help traders swap tokens at desired rates.\n* Liquidity Providers: LPs deposit tokens into liquidity pools and earn compounding fees. Pools are flexible and have features such as anti-sniping and concentrated liquidity, mimicking higher levels of liquidity and achieving better capital efficiency, volume, and returns. Compared to a typical AMM DEX, KyberSwap offers much better slippage for an equivalent pool and trade size and liquidity on KyberSwap would result in a much bigger positive impact on swap rates. AAVE token LPs can consider setting up a pool on KyberSwap to enjoy these advantages.\n* Developers: can integrate KyberSwap pools/farms and aggregation API into their wallets and DApps, providing superior rates for users.\n\nGeneral Stats\n\n* 60+ DeFi/GameFi Dapp integrations\n* $21 Billion+ lifetime trading volume\n* 500K web visits (Average last 3 months)\n* 7,000 average DAU\n* 15,000 average daily transactions\n* Current total TVL on all KyberSwap pools: $60M+\n* Total TVL from aggregated DEXes: $29B+\n\nAbout KNC\n\nToken Contract (Ethereum): 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on KyberDAO governance proposals that determine KyberSwap improvements, protocol upgrades, fee adjustments, and other crucial decisions.\n\nIn return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading activity on KyberSwap. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated. KNC stakers are also eligible for gas refunds when they meet certain trading requirements.\n\nKNC investors include: Hashed, Signum, ParaFi, HyperChain, and Stake Capital.\n\n**3- Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nKNC is the governance and utility token for KyberSwap, a leading DEX and Aggregator in DeFi.\n\nBy supporting KNC on Aave V3 Ethereum, we would give an additional utility to KNC holders by allowing them to borrow stables like GHO against their collateral token. In addition, users could lend or borrow KNC for leverage trading by using Aave protocol.\n\n* KNC is a highly liquid token but is still not on many decentralized lending platforms. Aave can easily be the biggest venue for KNC to be used as a borrow/collateral asset.\n* KNC price feeds are supported by Chainlink on Ethereum, as well as Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum.\n* KNC has over 16,000 token holders on Ethereum, including crypto VCs and other DeFi projects.\n* By supporting deposits of KNC as collateral, users can borrow stablecoins against their KNC to be used in various activities.\n* By supporting KNC as a borrow asset, KNC holders would be able to lend KNC to earn interest instead of selling their tokens. On the other hand, borrowers can borrow KNC for staking and voting on Kyber governance proposals or for liquidity mining.\n* There are a range of yield maximizing strategies and lower carry cost leveraged trading strategies that users could deploy.\n* Kyber team would gain the ability to deposit KNC from the treasury to borrow stablecoins for various activities.\n\nImportant note: More liquidity for KNC on Ethereum can be added if required by the Aave protocol; this can be discussed with the Aave team and community. We are also willing to provide some KNC incentives for Aave users if KNC is supported as a borrow and collateral asset.\n\n**4- Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nKyber was founded by Victor Tran, Loi Luu, and Yaron Velner in 2017, with the first protocol live in February 2018. All 3 founders are well-known researchers in the Ethereum and DeFi community, and Victor and Loi were both Forbes 30 under 30 recipients. Yaron is also the founder of B.Protocol and Risk DAO.\n\nSince inception, KyberSwap has successfully facilitated over $21 billion in transactions and over a million trades for tens of thousands of users, with 60+ DeFi/Dapp integrations.\n\nKyberSwap currently supports 14 chains including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, BNB Chain, ZkSync Era, Linea, Base, Polygon zkEVM, Fantom, Cronos, Aurora, BitTorrent, and Scroll (upcoming).\n\n* Developed one of the earliest DEXes in 2018 with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor.\n* One of the first platforms to aggregate liquidity pools/sources for swaps on Ethereum by integrating different DEXes.\n* Kyber initiated and co-launched Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), the most used wrapped version of BTC in the DeFi space today and a collateral asset on Aave.\n* First to develop and launch amplified pools with high capital efficiency for any token pair (before Uniswap v3), not just stablecoins.\n* In terms of 24H volume, KyberSwap is a Top 3 DEX on Optimism and Linea, Top 4 DEX on Polygon, and Top 5 DEX on Arbitrum, due to its high capital efficiency (High Volume/TVL).\n\nMain Features\n\n* DEX Aggregator: KyberSwap's aggregation algorithm automatically selects the best trade routes and prices from over 70 DEXes, saving time and money for thousands of users and offering superior rates for traders on supported chains.\n* Concentrated/Amplified Liquidity Pools: KyberSwap offers Elastic Pools and Classic Pools for liquidity providers. Elastic Pools have customizable price ranges, anti-sniping features, compounded fees, and concentrated liquidity, leading to better returns. Classic Pools have an amplification factor for improved capital efficiency.\n* KyberAI On-chain Analytics: Based on a proprietary scoring algorithm that uses artificial intelligence and on-chain data, KyberAI is able to help users identify high potential or trending tokens and provide key insights about the price, volume, and on-chain behavior for those tokens.\n* Limit Order: KyberSwap allows users to set Limit Orders for automatic buying/selling of assets at desired prices. Buy limit orders trigger at or below the set price, while sell limit orders trigger at or above it.\n\n**5- How is KNC currently used?**\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and an important part of KyberSwap operations.\n\n* Governance Rights: KNC holders can stake their tokens to become part of KyberDAO, gaining voting power to vote on KIPs (Kyber Improvement Proposals) which help govern KyberSwap and shape its development.\n* Voting Rewards: In return for staking, voting, and participating in governance, KNC holders are able to receive a portion of protocol trading fees generated on KyberSwap. More trades on KyberSwap generate more rewards for KNC holders.\n* Gas Refunds: KNC holders who stake their tokens are also able to enjoy gas refunds when they trade on KyberSwap, with the % of gas refunds dependent on their KNC staking tier.\n* Liquidity Provision: KNC holders can provide liquidity for the token by pairing it with another asset (e.g. KNC-USDC) and depositing the tokens into their preferred KyberSwap liquidity pool. KNC liquidity providers earn fees from the trading activity that goes through the pool.\n* Liquidity Incentives: KNC may be used by KyberDAO as liquidity mining rewards to incentivize liquidity providers on KyberSwap on top of standard trading fees, thereby providing more value to liquidity providers.\n\n**6- Emission schedule**\n\nThere is currently no automatic emission of KNC. All tokens for founders and advisors from the token sale have been distributed since September 2019.\n\n~14.3M KNC is managed by KyberDAO as part of an ecosystem growth fund to facilitate trade and liquidity mining, and other growth activities.\n\nKNC can be upgraded or minted by KyberDAO, subject to a DAO vote by KNC holders.\n\n**7- Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nKNC is an upgradeable token. The overall architecture for KyberDAO is largely based on Aave’s governance model with some differences/modifications such as the ability to enable the creation and voting of multi-option (generic, non-binary) proposals, and enabling the calculation of KyberDAO voting power based on a system that uses the KNC staking model.\n\nKNC is dynamic and can be upgraded or minted by KyberDAO (only via a vote) to better support liquidity and growth.\n\nThe DAO has in-built governance safeguards to ensure that any decision or contract alteration will always be preceded by a suitable time period of preparation and reflection, as well as a minimum voter participation threshold. In addition, we have a 5/9 multisig with the role of a DAO operator that assists with operational tasks and ensuring the integrity of the DAO. The multisig comprises a mix of Kyber team members and founders of external DeFi project representatives.\n\nThe Kyber team alone does not have the power to implement major changes to the KNC token, DAO, and the protocols in the network, without going through a DAO vote.\n\nChanges to KyberDAO and KNC can only be made by the KyberDAO via voting on a Kyber Improvement Proposal (KIP).\n\n**8- Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\n* Circulating market cap (12 September 2023): $90,543,409\n* 24H trading volume (12 September 2023): $10,065,292\n* Etherscan: 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n* Top exchanges are already supporting the latest version of KNC. KNC can be obtained on KyberSwap as well as centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Upbit, Bithumb, Bitrue, Crypto. com, OKX, Huobi, Bitfinex, KuCoin, Kraken, Gemini, MEXC, HitBTC, Gate. io, and Tokocrypto.\n\n\n### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community wait for the feedback from risk management teams (e.g. Gauntlet), we recommend the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nTicker: KNC\n\nContract Address : 0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Borrowable|YES|\n|Collateral Enabled|YES|\n|LTV|40%|\n|LT|50%|\n|LB|10%|\n|Debt Ceiling|TBD|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|\n|Supply Cap|TBD|\n|Borrow Cap|TBD|",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GHO Liquidity Strategy Update\nAuthor: @TokenLogic\nDated: 2023-09-08\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication details the revised liquidity strategy for GHO across Ethereum DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis publication outlines the GHO liquidity strategy with two main objectives:\n\n* Improve GHO peg\n* Promote diversified liquidity across multiple exchanges\n\nIt is widely accepted that the GHO peg requires improvement. This was especially evident when GHO traded at beneath 96 cents.\n\nFurthermore, several liquidity pools have come about organically on Maverick, Uniswap and Curve. Similar to the Balancer pools, these pools are mostly GHO which is reflective of the GHO price relative to the stable coin being paired within each pool.\n\nDo note, the existing Balancer pools are not being supported by Aave DAO. These pools are being supported by veBAL and vlAURA holders, mostly from contributors within each community.\n\nThe two initial pools being considered are GHO/USDT/USDC and GHO/LUSD until SM integration. This will be presented in a separate forum publication for future discussion. This publication will outline the Primary and Secondary Pools being proposed for GHO:\n\n* Balancer GHO/USDC/USDT - Primary\n* Balancer GHO/LUSD - Primary\n* Maverick GHO/LUSD Static - Secondary\n* Maverick GHO/LUSD Both - Secondary\n* Uniswap (Bunni) GHO/USDC Wide - Secondary\n* Uniswap (Bunni) GHO/USDC Narrow - Secondary\n* Curve Finance GHO/crvUSD - Secondary\n\nFor the purpose of this publication, we shall focus on the non Curve Finance pool. The GHO/crvUSD, and potentially GHO/FRAXBP, will be supported initially by the Aave DAO strategic asset holding once ready. How the DAO is to deploy the recently acquired CRV, is still yet to be determined.\n\nThis proposal aims to create a structure of liquidity outside of the SM strategy, including efficient options such as concentrated ranges of liquidity incentivised with and create a 3 months trial budget for vote incentives/rewards.\n\n## Maverick\n\nMaverick is an AMM capable of automating liquidity strategies without requiring maintenance. It enables to maximise capital efficiency by automating the concentration of liquidity as price moves. This built-in feature also helps LPs to eliminate the high gas fees that come from adjusting positions around price themselves.\n\nMAV is the governance token, however the tokenomics aren’t fully revealed yet. It’s known that MAV has a veTokenomics model. MAV emissions didn’t start yet, but it’s possible to incentivize liquidity on Maverick by adding rewards by creating & incentivising a boosted pool for a defined amount of time between 3 to 30 days.\n\n[A GHO/LUSD pool with 3 BPS & 0,1% width](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x30856df27a23d72b67347165f85e04b15d716d9e?chain=1), with liquidity in the range from 0,9811 to 0,9980 GHO per LUSD has been created and incentivised by Liquity with 1,5k LQTY per 7 days during 3 weeks. Additionally, LUSD liquidity managers proposed to create co-incentives for GHO/LUSD pools by committing up to 5K LQTY/month for the trial duration if this proposal is approved.\n\nConsidering that a range can’t be updated by governance, and since the pool was full GHO a few days ago, we’re considering updating the strategy above by creating a wider mode static boosted pool, and creating a pool mode both on top.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H15VjV8ya.png)\n    \nAs that the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch & since the unspent budget can’t be clawback (liquidity mining), incentives will start with a lower amount for a small duration (7 days) to easily follow the liquidity growth with the budget. Additional incentives can be added at any time.\n\nPros of incentivising liquidity on Maverick\n* Automated rebalancing\n* Fully customisable strategy\n* Maximal liquidity efficiency\n* Co-incentives if paired with LUSD\n* Protocol Owned Liquidity can reduce costs\n\nCons of incentivizing liquidity on Maverick\n* MAV emissions are not live yet\n* Updating a range requires to create a new position\n* Pools contracts are not verified yet\n* Boosted pools incentives are limited to 30 days (can be renewed)\n\n## Uniswap v3, Bunni.pro & Liquis\n\nUniswap V3 allows concentrated liquidity: liquidity allocated within a custom price range. It highly increases liquidity efficiency, leading to more volume, and with the potential of supporting stablecoins peg.\n\nBunni is a liquidity engine for incentivizing Uniswap v3 liquidity composed of two parts:\n\n* Protocol that wraps Uniswap liquidity positions into fungible ERC-20 tokens\n* vetokenomics system for incentivizing Bunni liquidity\n\nIt enables the creation of gauges receiving emissions while liquidity is in range. However, the liquidity isn’t actively rebalanced and gauges can be killed if the liquidity is out of range.\n\nLiquis is a governance wrapper for Bunni.pro similar to Convex & Aura.\n\nA [GHO/USDC pool with 0,05% fees](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x5c95d4b1c3321cf898d25949f41d50be2db5bc1d), with the range from 0,9497 to 1,0247 GHO per USDC has been created by community members. Timeless core contributors created an initial smaller range from 0,9757 to 1,0253 GHO per USDC, and submitted the proposal [TRC-66](https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/12245-trc-66-enable-ghousdc-gauge-with-2-cap) to enable GHO/USDC Gauge with 2% Cap on Bunni, which was [approved on July 27th](https://snapshot.org/#/timelessfi.eth/proposal/0xdf4027ad5c071bcbf045b9cb096ee63cae8bccacf4f33e489e50942c906419ee).\n\nRanges can be updated by governance, and since GHO went below the current price over the past days, we’re considering updating the wide range above, and creating a new narrow one on top.\n\nThe Aave DAO does not hold veLIT & oLIT incentives total worth is limited, so to reach the TVL target, this strategy will initially be supported with both veLIT/vlLIQ votes incentives created on Warden Quest, and GHO liquidity mining deposited on Bunni.pro gauges.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H14_jELJ6.png)\n    \nBunni gauges are not live yet, so the Min/Max APR on oLIT emissions will update depending on the actual working supply of each pool. For these estimations, the working supply used is from the current GHO-USDC proportionally to the estimated TVL.\n\nLiquis just launched and will enable a better optimisation but the LIQ token has no price yet, and the first round vote ended on September 6th so it’s not yet included in the tables below but this strategy will most likely be improved in the coming weeks.\n\nNevertheless, they have a launch partner program ongoing giving access to LIQ tokens vested in exchange of a bribe amount committed over 6 months max, but closing this week as the protocol launched.\n\nThe conditions are 0,1% of LIQ supply vested over 4 years for 10,000$ worth of votes incentives for vlLIQ holders (controlling veLIT voting power). While the tokens are vested, the voting power can still be used until the end of the vesting duration, further increasing the yield or enabling recycling part of the bribes spent. More information on the program can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/liquis.eth/K_-1jp7sLkylKc2V1XxkK0CObsqyaTq-89yScI4tapo).\n\nveLIT bribes were initially considered, so if this proposal is approved, the Aave DAO will be a launch partner by committing an amount of $20k of votes incentives for vlLIQ holders over the next 3 months and will receive 0,2% of the LIQ supply.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1m5oN8yp.png)\n    \nThese estimations are made at the current time so it excludes LIQ emissions, liqLIT redemption mechanism, DAO vested voting power & impact on the strategy. The tables will be updated in the coming weeks if the overall strategy is approved. The proportion of bribes veLIT vs vs LIQ vs LM might also be optimized during the trial.\n\nSimilar to Maverick, as the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch & because the unspent budget can only be clawback, which represents a limited part of the budget, LM rewards will be added progressively every 7 days to follow the TVL growth.\n\nPros of incentivizing liquidity on Bunni/Liquis\n* Built on top of Uniswap v3\n* LIT tokenomics are live (oLIT & veBoost)\n* Liquis (Convex-like) recently launched will enable strategy optimisation\n* Launch partner program earning LIQ tokens vested & voting power\n* Updating a range earning rewards can be done by governance\n* Extra liquidity mining rewards can be added on Bunni gauges\n* Protocol Owned liquidity can reduce costs\n\nCons of incentivizing liquidity on Bunni/Liquis\n* Liquidity is not automatically rebalanced\n* oLIT option token design is complex for users (liqLIT improves this)\n* BPT 80/20 design & oLIT redemption create selling pressure on LIT token\n* Reward are split between emissions from bribes + LM\n* Bunni gauges can be killed if out of range ([Process](https://docs.bunni.pro/docs/guides/kill-gauge))\n\n## Balancer & Aura:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the existing Balancer pools are not being supported by Aave DAO yet and votes on GHO gauges depend on veBAL and vlAURA holders, mostly from contributors within each community. Moreover, GHO/USDC/USDT & GHO/LUSD are expected to be included in the SM at a later stage, but might need to create a base liquidity supported by the DAO before external votes fades away.\n\nBoth pools currently have classic gauges eligible for BAL rewards. According to recent changes from AIP-42, the budget allocated will be used to create vlAURA votes incentives on Warden Quest.\n\nThe initial strategy proposed is 400k vlAURA votes bribed to sustain 5% APR on a $5M TVL for each pool. The APR could be increased later on by using Aave voting power and blacklisting the DAO from the created Quests to attract more voters for the same cost.\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1m2iVIyp.png)\n    \nHowever, spending incentives on stableswap liquidity could be counter-effective before GHO peg is restored, so incentives might start after concentrated liquidity ones, and if the external support left.\n\nSimilar to Maverick & Bunni, since the full max estimated TVL is unlikely to be deposited at launch, incentives will be deposited progressively to follow the liquidity growth. Nevertheless, 100% of the budget is spent in bribes so the unspent budget can be clawback on Warden Quest, enabling Aave DAO to pay a fixed price per vote for an important amount without overspending if the votes target isn’t reached.\n\nAs always, happy to fix potential mistakes in the strategies estimations if any.\n\n# Reward Budget Overview\n\n## Maverick & Uniswap v3, Bunni & Liquis (Concentrated Liquidity)\n\n![|614x136](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KZT-mvb1ghTBmz8020oRT9Weuuhpb9fkQo5I6gxtWctBbsSHosgKImk2xTOd43_ecTyuYY69RdbBYpvZaz8rufVuHEwMf0ql7wlA-fcIud5NJxtDcc7cl5Z8tX0w3n95eXwVxhV5pX4ODeExRq3lAlc)\n\n## Balancer/Aura \n\n![|614x97](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nStACC51kMLhOAjPpR3ggm4CnN4nCnnNlsW-nCvwDbJVmusGylrbI76Vdh9HrvhBTKb2bN8kn8UaQvpmRFZDZuOl3Mj2iWu0O4u6moaryipfDShySP95EG88ecnvkoaIh46-tWh4D0jNqK4LP8xjinY)\n\nThe budget breakdown below contains two different margins:\n\n* Assume that all strategies will begin to be incentivized at the same time, and with the maximum amount.

This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH.\n\nLSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.\n\nOnboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.\n\nAave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.\n\nRocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem.\n\nSpecification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal.\nIncreasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions.\n\nthe ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators.\nRocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH\nrETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH.\nThe rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time.\nSimply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.\nWithout a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.\nRocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold.\nAbstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nrETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.\nrETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.\nrETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.\nrETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.\nrETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years.\nThe Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021.\nrETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2\nThe Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool — Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2\n5. How is the rETH token currently used?\n\nBalancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M\n\nUniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity\n\nrETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI\n\nimage\nimage\n1231×203 17.2 KB\nIt’s likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding.\n\nSee the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\nrETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\nThe Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities.\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $287 118 738\n24H Volume ~$3.75M\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\n\nExchanges:\n\nBalancer (main source of liquidity)\nUniswap\nCurve\nBancor\nFurther information here: Rocket Pool Explorer 4 2 and Dune 1\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 17770 1 members\nTwitter: 34548 followers\nGithub: 66 followers\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nThe below applies to just wstETH on Optimism:\n\nDate of Deployment: Sep 30th 2021\nNumber of Transactions: 73358\nNumber of holders for token: 9104 (liquidity pools are recorded as 1 address)\nTechnical Specifications\nA comprehensive technical analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO technical team here is their report:\n\n[rETH] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Technical Assessment 2\n\nSecurity Considerations\nRocketPool smart contracts have been independently audited by three best-in-class audit firms:\n\nhttps://rocketpool.net/files/sigma-prime-audit.pdf 1\nRocketpool | ConsenSys Diligence\npublications/RocketPool.pdf at master · trailofbits/publications · GitHub 1\nbug bounty: https://immunefi.com/bounty/rocketpool/\n\nRisk Analysis\nA comprehensive risk analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO risk team here is their report:\n\n[rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation 9\n\nRisk parameters\nThe Following Risk parameters are the result of Chaos Labs & Gauntlet risk teams joint work.\n\nAs such, we recommend the following parameters:\n\nIsolation Mode - No\n\nWhile isolation mode provides newer, untested assets a safe backdrop to evolve, by only allowing stablecoin borrowing, in the context of rETH however, it excludes potentially the largest use case of rETH collateral, which is to borrow correlated assets in WETH or wstETH. Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.\n\nBorrowable - Yes\n\nWe are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aave’s markets.\n\nLT - 74%; LTV 67%\n\nWe recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we’ve identified above.\n\nLB - 7.5%\n\nWe recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH.\n\nRF - 15%\n\nLPF - 0.1\n\nDebt Ceiling - NA\n\nSupply Cap - 10K\n\nBorrow Cap - 1200\n\nOur analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets.\n\n| Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap |\n| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |\n| rETH   | NO             | YES        | YES                | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A         | 10K       | 1200      |\n\n\n## Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor\n\nrETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later.\n\nParameter | Recommendation\n--------- | -------------\nBase | 0\nSlope 1 | 0.07\nUoptimal | 0.45\nSlope 2 | 3.0\nReserve Factor | 0.15\n\nUnder these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI). From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.",

        "body": "**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA\n\n**Author:** @Khan \n\n**Date:** Sep 12, 2023\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal brings on Centrifuge as a service provider to the Aave DAO to setup a legal structure to support RWA investments, develop RWA specific management and governance processes, and allocate $1M of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings to a liquid US T-Bill fund on Centrifuge, as a proof of concept investment.\n\nThis is a first step towards a long term effort for Aave to develop and launch an RWA Facilitator that will back GHO with Real World Assets. With this proposal Aave can earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in the RWA industry.\n\nThe proposal minimizes upfront cost and completely recoups the initial investment within 6-12mo and starts earning yield for Aave within the first 3mo. It locks up no long term capital and leaves the DAO in full control over the treasury allocation.\n\nThe main results of this proposal:\n1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave protocol to invest in RWAs.\n1. Through Prime, the Aave Treasury will allocate $1M of USDC to the Anemoy LTF, a short-duration US treasury bill pool on Centrifuge.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, ignoring the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets for various reasons.\n\nToday, with roughly 17% of the treasury in stablecoins (~13m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of recurring revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment. These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.\n\nBeyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime is purpose-built for DeFi native organizations, offering the critical services and infrastructure necessary to onboard a diverse portfolio of RWA through a single interface.\n\nCentrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams.\n\n### **Specification**\n\n#### **Setting up the Aave DAO Legal Conduit**\nThis proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure for the benefit of the Aave DAO that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave token holder vote.\n\nThe process for establishing the legal framework is as follows: The Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Aave DAOs interests. The legal structure itself will be established per the previously discussed legal framework developed by Centrifuge. The defining documents and legal agreement team will be created to incorporate specific processes around the DAOs interaction with the foundation company. The results of this work will be presented to the Aave DAO, an analysis from the external counsel will be provided, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, likely via Snapshot or other requisite process as requested by the community.\n\nThe legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance through a process defined in the legal documents, is capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO full legal recourse to their investments. The legal counsel, while required under local Cayman law, is retained for the purposes of having an independent legal party to protect Aave’s interest.\n\nThe structure defines the actions the foundation can take, such as initiating investments or redemptions. Any action can be made only with approval from the DAO and providing a DAO approved “resolution” to the Foundation entity described above instructing the Foundation to act in accordance with the resolution. The specific details of this process will be developed alongside the Aave community.\n\nThis framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures 1. There, the same structure is used to support a >$1.2B debt ceiling, with >600m+ actively deployed.\n\nMore information on the fund, the legal framework, and the processes described here can be found in the [on going FAQ discussion here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n\n#### **Initial pilot investment in Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund**\n\nOnce the legal structure has been defined and implemented, a specific DAO resolution will be presented to the DAO that instructs the Foundation to perform a 1M investment into the Anemoy LTF and transfers 1M USDC from the DAOs treasury into the Anemoy pool onchain.\nCentrifuge will work with Aave to do an initial test investment and then a partial redemption to test out the complete rails.\n\n#### **Scaling beyond the first transaction**\n\nIt is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. This proposal creates an initial deployment into the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund of $1M (pending DAO approval at the time investment). It is up to the community to initiate further investments, but we recommend keeping RWA allocations at a fixed cap of the overall Aave balance sheet until the community is more comfortable.\n\nFrom there on, further investment and redemption actions are in full control of the Aave DAO. The process can easily be integrated to support portfolio and allocation decisions made through a more formal treasury management process, either manually or programmatically. Centrifuge is committed to supporting these efforts for the duration of this proposal’s stream.\n\nOutside of US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes in the future:\n\n| Bucket| Description | Target Return | Liquidity\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Liquid | Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds| 5-6% | Daily\n| Preservation | Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc. | 6-8% | 3-6 months\n| Acceleration | Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets | 8-20% | 3-24mo |\n\n#### **Summary Process**\nIn summary, the following process will be executed through this proposal:\n1. Acquire Caymans Legal Counsel\n1. Conduct initial legal research and analysis alongside counsel, share to forum\n1. Post proposed legal documents and legal arrangement to forum, host community call, gather and implement community feedback. Arrangement will include explicit processes for management of the foundation company (i.e. investments and redemptions).\n1. DAO approval of legal implementation\n1. Foundation company onboards to Anemoy LTF\n1. DAO proposal request for 1m of USDC investment into Anemoy LTF\n\n\n**Estimated Timeline & Project Phases**\n\n\n| Activity | Description | Est. Time |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Legal setup | Creation of Foundation Company, passing of DAO resolutions to start deployment into RWAs | 1-2 months\n| Initial Deployment | DAO instructs Foundation to deploy $1M into a US Treasuries Fund and transfers $1M in USDC Stablecoins into the Anemoy LTF | 2-3mo\n| Scaling up / Ongoing Operation | DAO can vote on increase allocation to Prime and direct investments towards a variety of liquid lower yielding and more longer term investments at any time | After 3mo\n\n#### **Fees**\nWhile there are some legal setup costs that have to be covered by the DAO upfront we limit these as much as possible.\n\nEven at a conservative deployment of just $2M and a portfolio return equal to current US Treasury yields Aave should break-even within the first 6mo and start generating revenue for the DAO thereafter.\n\nThe legal work will be useful far beyond this initial proposal and can be the basis on which Aave onboards RWAs into GHO.\n\n**Fees**\n| Fee | Amount | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Legal Setup | up to 50,000 USDC | To be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Aave DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the Aave treasury.\n|Portfolio Fee | 0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M | Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintaining the portfolio\n|Aave Reward | 500 stkAave streamed over 2 years into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first 1M UDSC Deployment into Centrifuge Prime |To cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.\n\n### **Summary of changes & discussion with the community since the Temp Check**\n* In discussion:\n    * Provided more details on the legal framework\n    * Provided more details on the Anemoy LTF\n    * Hosted individual and group calls with active delegates and voting participants to answer questions and provide further context\n    * Hosted a public Twitter Space\n* In this ARFC:\n    * Modified the proposal to focus primarily on an initial 1m RWA investment, with further investments explicitly out of scope\n    * Specified Aave Reward to be paid out only upon deployment of the initial investment\n    * Further explanation of legal constructs\n    * Further explanation on use of funds\n    * Defined a more detailed and explicit process for the establishment of the legal framework\n    * Defined a more detailed and explicit process for the initial 1m investment\n    * Breakout of proposal delivery steps and phase\n### **Additional Resources**\n* [Temp Check Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-treasury-proposal-for-rwa-allocation/14381)\n* [Further Discussion and Q&A](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n* [Centrifuge Prime Announcement](https://medium.com/centrifuge/introducing-centrifuge-prime-real-yields-real-defi-b97a0e767f18)\n* [A Discussion on a GHO Real World Asset Facilitator](https://governance.aave.com/t/a-discussion-on-a-gho-real-world-asset-facilitator/11908/5)\n### **Disclaimer:**\nThis proposal is written by a member of the k/factory team, a core contributor to the Centrifuge protocol.\n### **Next Steps:**\nUpon approval, Centrifuge will work with the DAO to implement and execute the AIP.\n### **Copyright:**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
