The goal is to enhance the sustainability and independence of the program, ensuring continued support for active delegates in the Aave community.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe pilot phase of Orbit, funded by ACI, has been a success in its first quarter. Recognizing its positive impact, there's a need to expand and generalize the program, ensuring its longevity and alignment with the broader Aave community goals.\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe proposed funding for the Orbit initiative remains at $5,000 per month, with payments to be made in GHO stablecoin. Orbit operates on a quarterly basis, with eligibility criteria defined for each quarter.\n\nFor the upcoming quarter, the eligibility criteria will mirror that of the [[ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680). In subsequent quarters, a threshold of voting power and diversity of delegation will be introduced to ensure the program's integrity and to prevent potential abuse. To fund the Orbit initiative, stablecoins from the Aave DAO treasury will be used to purchase GHO on secondary markets, which is expected to have a minor positive effect on the GHO peg.\n\n### Eligible Delegates:\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Participation Rate |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 100.0% |\n| ACI | 0x329c54289ff5d6b7b7dae13592c6b1eda1543ed4 | 94.67% |\n| Wintermute | 0xb933aee47c438f22de0747d57fc239fe37878dd1 | 93.33% |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 93.33% |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 86.67% |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 78.67% |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 73.33% |\n| NewTokenLogic | 0x2cc1ade245020fc5aae66ad443e1f66e01c54df1 | 32.0%* |\n\n*Note: Tokenlogic transitioned from an old to a new delegate address during last quarter, their cumulative score considering both addresses is matching other delegates scores*\n\n### Recipient Delegates\n\nhere's the list of delegates accepting participation in Orbit. for the next quarter\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Budget |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 15.000 GHO |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 15.000 GHO |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 15.000 GHO |\n|**Total Budget** | **75.000 GHO**|\n\n### Implementation:\n\nIf this ARFC gets governance support, the implementation will consolidate some Aave DAO treasury stablecoin holdings to acquire GHO on secondary markets. Subsequently, a new set of streams of 15,000 GHO will be created to the eligible delegates' addresses for a period of 90 days.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1.

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023\nAuthor: Marc Zeller (@marczeller) - Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\nDate: 2023-09-04\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\nThis ARFC proposes the quarterly gas rebate distribution for recognized delegates. The distribution aims to reimburse the gas costs incurred by delegates during their participation in Aave governance.\n\n## Motivation:\nRecognized delegates play a crucial role in Aave governance by actively participating in proposal discussions, voting, and other governance activities. These activities often involve gas costs, especially when interacting with the Ethereum network. The Aave community established a quarterly gas rebate distribution to incentivize and support their continued participation.\n\n## Specification:\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the total gas used by each recognized delegate and the corresponding ETH amount to be distributed:\n\n| Name             | Total Gas Spent          |\n|------------------|--------------------------|\n| ACI              | 1.35      |\n| HKTrust          | 0.07     |\n| TokenLogic       | 0.50     |\n| michigan         | 0.11     |\n| LBS Blockchain   | 0.18     |\n| Wintermute       | 0.15     |\n| keyrock          | 0.14     |\n| Stablelab        | 0.20     |\n| **Total ETH** | **2.7 ETH** | \n\n\n\n### Notes:\n1. @Alice forked and edited the flipside script to improve it & increase accuracy to track voting participation. here's the new script : https://dune.com/queries/2970451\n2. The voting requirement was lowered to 70% from 80% to include Michigan & HKUST. Ideally, all recognized delegates would maintain an 80% participation rate. However, considering the summer break and the involvement of student delegates, a more lenient approach was adopted this quarter.\n3. The script was updated to track better gas spent by Gnosis Safes, benefiting both TokenLogic & HKUST. This improvement was a joint effort by @JosepBove & @MarcZeller.\n[the output of the script can be seen here](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gas-rebate-August-2023-Script-output-d611e6123ffb4397b61d94c73e64c8c7?pvs=4)\njust like last quarter, amounts have been rounded strictly up to the second decimal place for more straightforward AIP implementation.\n4. Some delegates, including ACI & Tokenlogic, are transitioning from old addresses to new ones. This transition was considered when determining eligibility for the rebate.\n5. Proposal creation & execution expenses were covered. Service providers interested in having their costs covered can discuss this in this thread. Payload deployments are not covered this quarter due to technical reasons.\n6. Instead of wETH, it is proposed to distribute ETH directly this quarter for ease of use for all delegates.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.

If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] TokenLogic Hohmann Transfer\nauthor: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\ncreated: 2023-10-05\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC proposes the inclusion of TokenLogic in the \"Orbit\" delegate platform initiative for a period of 90 days, with a monthly compensation of 5k GHO and total budget of 15k GHO.\n\n## Motivation\nTokenLogic has been an active and valuable participant in the Aave ecosystem. While they were initially eligible and considered for the Orbit program, they opted to explore the possibility of becoming a service provider to the DAO. However, given their recent decision to re-organize internally and re-evaluate their proposed scope as a service provider, it's appropriate to reconsider their inclusion in the Orbit program.\n\n## Specification\n\n### TokenLogic Inclusion\n\n- TokenLogic will be recognized as an official delegate within the Orbit program for a period of 90 days.\n- They will receive a monthly compensation of 5k GHO, totaling 15k GHO over the three-month period.\n\n### Funding and Emissions\n\nTokenLogic's compensation will be in line with the Orbit program's guidelines, ensuring fairness and consistency with other delegates.\n\n### Responsibilities and Conditions\n\n- TokenLogic will actively participate in Aave governance, representing their delegators and contributing to the protocol's growth.\n- If TokenLogic presents and successfully passes a proposal to become a service provider to the DAO, their Orbit funding stream will be terminated to prevent double compensation.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The inclusion of TokenLogic is based on their merits and contributions to the Aave community.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

However, the current structure of the collector contract hinders direct participation in other DAOs' governance. To effectively leverage this power and actively participate in pivotal governance decisions, such as LTIPs on Arbitrum, the creation of APE is essential.\nThis will allow the Aave DAO to have a mete-governance embassy represented by Aave DAO service providers and significant delegates.\n\n## Specification\n\nAPE will function as a 3/4 Gnosis SAFE multisig, holding governance tokens to cast votes on behalf of the Aave DAO. The proposed multisig structure requires a 3/4 signature for actions:\n\n- ACI (acting as the coordinator) : Delegate and service provider\n- Token Logic : Delegate and service provider\n- KarpatKey: Delegate and service provider\n- EzR3al : largest delegate platform\n\nThis proposal aims to seed this Multisig with Aave DAO ARB tokens currently held by the Aave Collector contract. [Aave Treasury V3](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x053D55f9B5AF8694c503EB288a1B7E552f590710)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Initiate a discussion within the Aave community to gather feedback on the proposal.\n2. Conduct a snapshot vote for community consensus.\n3. If successful, proceed with an AIP seeding the multisig with the ARB tokens\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative, along with the proposed multisig members, will manage APE with a commitment to representing Aave DAO's best interests in external protocol governance, without external compensation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "**Title:** [ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO\n\n**Author:** Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n**Date:** 2023-11-21\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC introduces an enhancement to the Safety Module by integrating a GHO Safety Module. This new category aims to mitigate risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events within its ecosystem. It also reduces the Safety incentives for StkAAVE and StkBPT.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[AIP-366 was adopted by governance](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/366/) to reduce the safety incentives of StkAAVE and StkBPT, but an implementation bug made the AIP execution impossible. After discussion with DAO service providers, it was decided to bundle the re-run of 366 with the creation of the GHO safety module and the StkGHO asset.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will fortify the Aave Protocol's resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversifies the Safety Module's capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will target a liquidity pool of 9M GHO with an APR range of 12-15%, achievable with a daily emission of 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day period. The module will have a slashing rate set at 100%, meaning the entirety of the deposits could be utilized in a shortfall event, with socialized coverage among StkGHO holders. The cooldown period is adjusted to 10 days, which is suitable for a stablecoin.\n\n## Specification\n**Revised Safety Module Emissions Rate:**\n\n| Asset      | Previous Emissions | Proposed Emissions |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| StkAAVE    | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkBPT     | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkGHO     | N/A               | 35 AAVE/day        |\n\n- **GHO Safety Module Parameters:**\n  - Target Liquidity: 9M GHO\n  - Target APR: 12-15%\n  - Emissions Period: 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day cycle\n  - Slashing Rate: 100%\n  - Cooldown Period: 10 days\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and has not been compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
