        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "## Author: @ACI\n## Date: 2024-11-13\n\n---\n\n**Proposal Overview:**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK seeks to gauge the Aave community’s interest in deploying Aave V3 on the Spiderchain, the leading Bitcoin EVM L2 developed by Botanix Labs. \n\nBotanix Labs proposes this integration to expand Aave within the emerging Bitcoin DeFi narrative, with the first Bitcoin L2 with a full DeFi ecosystem and the largest community of users - including a new market of Bitcoiners transacting on chain for the first time. Upon mainnet launch, Botanix will also present to the market its synthetic 1:1 representation of Bitcoin on the L2, which will be the most decentralized form of “wrapped” Bitcoin in the EVM ecosystem. \n\nThis can help diversify the type of Bitcoin assets on Aave, especially considering its acceptance by the Bitcoin community. Botanix also intends to incorporate the GHO stablecoin throughout the ecosystem to further strategically align with Aave, providing incremental revenue upside for Aave DAO.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe Spiderchain is the first fully decentralized EVM-equivalent Layer 2 on Bitcoin, where the ease and versatility of EVM meets the decentralization and security of Bitcoin. Leveraging Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) as a Layer 1 for base settlement and decentralization, Botanix Labs will use a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model, where the stakes (represented by bitcoin) are securely stored on the Spiderchain, a distributed network of decentralized multisigs safeguarded by a randomized subset of participants. Botanix runs on Bitcoin, with BTC as the gas token and settlement layer, and yield accrued back to stakers in native BTC. The Spiderchain is the most performant Bitcoin L2 EVM with average block times of ~5 seconds and gas fees of $0.01 per transaction. As noted above, Botanix’ form of “wrapped” Bitcoin will be the most decentralized form of Bitcoin in the L2 EVM ecosystem - with decentralized sequencers available on Day 1. As such, Aave’s counterparty risk with BTC derivatives will be significantly reduced and offer greater asset diversification, especially as the Spiderchain enjoys widespread acceptance within the technical community.\n\nThe Botanix Labs team preempted the Bitcoin Season II narrative and has been building for almost two years. As such, they have already built out the major DeFi primitives required for an end-to-end DeFi experience with ~20 native ecosystem teams and another ~40 dApps (including Tier 1 DeFi protocols such as Vertex, Frax, Kiln, etc.) deploying Day 1 of mainnet. The non-incentivized testnet v0 launched in November 2023 and garnered 1.5M transactions, 500K users/wallets connected, 30K contracts launched community. Botanix Labs also has ~60K highly engaged community members, making it the largest organic community in Bitcoin. Despite not having a chain-level points program, the team has secured significant Day 1 liquidity commitments.\n\nBy deploying Aave V3 on the Spiderchain, they aim to enhance liquidity options and provide users with more opportunities within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Reasons for Integration:**\n\n1. **Early Mover Advantage within Bitcoin DeFi as a Launch Partner**\n    - With a deployment on the Spiderchain, and considering Aave’s brand as the incumbent leader in DeFi, Aave has the potential to capture significant early mover advantage on the only Bitcoin chain with a high-quality DeFi ecosystem as the flagship lending protocol. As the most decentralized Bitcoin-aligned chain, Botanix Labs has also secured net new TVL commitments from BTC whales who have previously never engaged with DeFi.\n2. **Access and Penetration to Bitcoiner userbase**\n    - The Spiderchain plans to be the home of Bitcoin-native DeFi, whereby once a user onboards their Bitcoin to the Botanix EVM, they can have an end-to-end DeFi experience (DEX, stablecoins, lending/borrowing, derivatives, staking, etc.) and experience native bitcoin yield without necessarily bridging to other chains. As such, it attracts a new Bitcoiner profile that is excited about DeFi and the potential of earning yield. With an integration, Aave can attract this new set of on-chain users.\n3. **Integration with GHO within the Spiderchain ecosystem**\n    - Botanix Labs will integrate and support the GHO stablecoin across the ecosystem, as one of the key USD stablecoins that will enable users to borrow against their BTC collateral.\n    - The core product of the GHO stablecoin, backed by BTC, is one of the most anticipated use cases for Bitcoiners and the Botanix team expects rapid adoption of this primitive. Assuming a linear increase in GHO borrowing caps, the team expects a high capture rate of new borrows with Aave DAO being the primary beneficiary in this interest income upside.\n4. **Innovation within Bitcoin Scaling**\n    - The Spiderchain is well accepted as a meaningful technical innovation within the Bitcoin community, with its innovation of decentralized multisigs supported by PoS being recognized as one of the few L2 scaling designs that is possible today on Bitcoin core without any soft forks needed.\n5. **Most Performant Bitcoin L2**\n    - The Spiderchain offers high throughput and low latency, with 5 second block times, which can support Aave’s transaction demands and maintain user experience.\n    - Lower transaction fees on the Spiderchain can reduce operational costs for Aave users and make DeFi activities more affordable.\n6. **Strategic Partnership with Chainlink**\n    - Chainlink Labs is a strategic partner of Botanix Labs, as a key infrastructure and market partner. Botanix Labs will integrate with ChainLink’s Price Feeds as the oracle provider for the market, and with the recently announced Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enhance the functionality and security of Aave on the Spiderchain.\n7. **Liquidity Provision**\n    - As Botanix Labs is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem, they have been able to secure significant liquidity commitments and can bootstrap initial liquidity for Aave to run smoothly upon deployment. Exact LP details can be determined in the next phase of the deployment process, but we can conservatively expect at least $20M in BTC commitments to Aave upon mainnet launch.\n\n**Technical Feasibility:**\n\n1. **Seamless Integration and Compatibility with v4:**\n    - The Spiderchain is EVM-equivalent, running the rust implementation of the EVM (reth), ensuring an easy integration with Aave V3’s existing codebase.\n2. **Chainlink Integration:**\n    - ChainLink’s Price Feeds will be available Day 1 of mainnet, along with CCIP as the canonical bridging partner.\n3. **The Graph Integration:**\n    - Botanix Labs will have The Graph’s subgraph functionality enabled Day 1 of mainnet, ensuring an easy migration for Aave.\n4. **Development and Testing:**\n    - Botanix Labs will coordinate with Aave’s technical team including BGD to ensure a seamless deployment, including comprehensive testing on Botanix’s testnet.\n5. **Security Audits:**\n    - Botanix Labs will work with Aave’s security team to perform thorough audits and ensure that the deployment meets all security standards.\n\n**Deployment Plan:**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Initial Discussion**\n    - Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n2. **Phase 2: Detailed Proposal**\n    - If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n3. **Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring**\n    - Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on the Spiderchain and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n**Risks and Mitigations:**\n\n1. **Technical Challenges:**\n    - Botanix Labs will work closely with Aave’s developers and service providers (such as BGD and ACI) to address any technical challenges during integration.\n2. **Security Risks:**\n    - A comprehensive security audit will be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This would be in addition to the proposal’s review by Aave’s risk managers, Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk.\n3. **Community Adoption:**\n    - They will engage with the Aave community throughout the process to ensure alignment and support.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nWe invite the Aave community to express their support or concerns regarding this TEMP CHECK. Your feedback is crucial in determining whether to proceed with a detailed ARFC for the Aave V3 deployment on the Spiderchain, and will help us ensure that the integration aligns with Aave’s goals and community interests.\n\n**Links and References:**\n\n- The Spiderchain Overview: https://docs.botanixlabs.xyz/botanix-labs/\n- Aave V3 Technical Documentation: https://docs.aave.com/developers\n- Botanix Labs: https://botanixlabs.xyz/\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave V3 on Mode \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-23\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nMode is a state-of-the-art, modular L2 blockchain that builds on the Ethereum network via deployment on the OP Superchain. \n\nDeploying Aave on Mode involves setting up a new instance of the Aave protocol on the Mode L2 blockchain, which is positioned to be the DeFi hub of the OP Superchain. This proposal aims to leverage Mode's modular infrastructure tailored for DeFi applications, offering potential enhancements in scalability and interoperability within the ecosystem.\n\n## **Motivation/Background**\n\nMode intends to be the DeFi hub of the Superchain, offering a best-in-class yield experience by attracting cutting edge and innovative DeFi protocols to weave into and build atop of a solid foundation of trusted blue chip favorites, Velodrome, Balancer en route, and (hopefully soon-to-be) Aave.\n\nMode stands apart in its approach to DeFi and liquidity architecture by working closely with stalwart protocols and teams to push integrations and intra-chain operability. By keeping an extremely active presence in the telegram channels and engaging in transformative open dialogue, Mode harnesses the collective wisdom of its builders to design an L2 every DeFi user would be proud to call home. Mode currently has baked-in incentives to help bootstrap early protocols via an ongoing metric based DevDrop which is redistributed to users, as well as Sequencer Fee Sharing, which passes a portion of fees back to the protocols.\n\nSince its Mainnet inception in early 2024, Mode has attracted significant TVL from the BTC L2 ecosystems as well as popular LRTs in the Ethereum AVS sector. Mode has risen into the Top 15 by TVL on DefiLlama, with a current USDC stablecoin dominance. The next priority is supporting more yield bearing assets, both volatile and stable, to enable automated vault strategies, yield markets, and more powerful index synthetics.\n\n### **1. Benefits of deploying to Mode:**\n\n**Scalability**:\n\n- Utilizes Mode's L2 solutions to reduce gas fees and transaction times, enhancing user experience and adoption.\n- Mode has been recognized for having some of the most affordable transaction rates among Layer 2 solutions, which can significantly attract more users to Aave.\n\n**Security**:\n\n- Features a robust multisig management system with oversight from the Mode Security Council, the Optimism Security Council, and the Optimism Foundation.\n- This setup prevents unilateral control over significant changes, providing a secure and stable environment for financial operations.\n- Includes rapid incident response capabilities through a partnership with Optimism, enabling quick technical interventions and smart contract upgrades to maintain system integrity.\n\n**Interoperability**:\n\n- Boasts EVM compatibility and is equipped with LayerZero OFT technology (with upcoming CCIP enablement), facilitating seamless integrations and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem and extending to Bitcoin L2s (like Merlin chain).\n\n**Strategic Significance**:\n\n- Aligns with Mode's modular infrastructure which is optimized for scalability and interoperability, enhancing the overall functionality and reach of Aave.\n- Supports Mode's strategic goals to become the DeFi hub of the Superchain, leveraging its ecosystem to foster significant growth and innovation for both Aave and Mode.\n- Compelling access to BTC synthetics, leveraging Mode’s maturing relationship with Bitcoin Layer 2s.\n- Deploying one of the fastest growing L2s in the space, Mode currently sits within the Top 15 by TVL on DefiLlama.\n\n### **2. Why it makes sense for Aave and Mode to pursue this new deployment.**\n\n**Effects on Liquidity**\n\n- **Increased Asset Pool**: Integration with Mode L2 allows Aave to leverage Mode’s significant m-BTC liquidity and other assets, potentially enhancing the variety and volume in Aave’s lending markets.\n- **Diverse Liquidity Sources**: The presence of synthetic Bitcoin as well as popular LRTs already on Mode broaden the liquidity base, making Aave’s market more versatile.\n\n**User Adoption**\n\n- **Lowered Cost and Enhanced UX**: Mode’s low transaction fees and optimized user interface are likely to attract both existing and new DeFi users to Aave, increasing the protocol’s adoption.\n- **Community Engagement**: Mode’s proactive community outreach and education will aid in effectively onboarding new users to Aave, fostering a deeper understanding and longer-term user retention. Established DeFi players also feel more comfortable depositing in AAVE versus newer protocols, which should spur growth.\n\n**Overall Market Growth**\n\n- **Market Expansion**: Aave’s integration into Mode’s DeFi-centric infrastructure contributes significantly to the broader adoption and growth of the DeFi market on Mode L2, likely to attract fresh capital from other chains who were otherwise waiting for Aave’s deployment.\n- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Mode’s infrastructure supports higher transaction volumes and operational efficiency, a boost for Aave’s scalability and ability to serve more users without compromising on performance.\n\n**Impact on Mode's Liquidity**\n\n- **Enhanced Platform Value**: Aave’s robust lending options add substantial value to Mode’s platform, enhancing overall liquidity and financial activity.\n- **Synergistic Effects**: Aave’s deployment can attract additional protocols and assets that seek to utilize Aave’s liquidity in yield-bearing architecture, thereby enriching Mode’s entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Contribution to Aave's Growth**\n\n- **Strategic Expansion**: Deploying on Mode aligns with Aave’s strategy to innovate within the DeFi space, using Mode’s advanced L2 solutions to access new markets and user bases.\n- **Long-term Benefits**: Integration with Mode’s diverse assets and user-friendly infrastructure is expected to sustain Aave’s growth and presence in the competitive DeFi market.\n\n### **3. Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMode will take several steps in ensuring deep liquidity is deposited to Aave upon deployment.\n\n- Mode will integrate Aave into the Mode dashboard (100,000 daily visits) and points program, which has been a key driver of TVL for Mode applications.\n- Mode will work with existing and new LPs to bootstrap pools.\n- Mode will work with LRT partners to include Aave in ongoing dual incentive campaigns\n- Mode will include Aave in Optimism related incentive campaigns\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nWebsite: https://www.mode.network/\n\nL2 Beat: https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/modeDefiLlama: https://defillama.com/chain/Mode\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 MVP deployment on Neon EVM Mainnet\n\nAuthor: Neon Foundation & Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of Aave V3 MVP on the NEON EVM Mainnet, expanding Aave’s presence and enabling access to unaddressed users, liquidity, community and ecosystem of Solana.\n\n# Background:\n\nNeon EVM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment solution built on the Solana blockchain which makes it the first parallelized EVM with direct access to Solana liquidity. Neon EVM allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps on Solana and access its native ecosystem and network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities without changing their codebases. Neon EVM currently has interoperability with Solana SPL tokens and the plan is to develop full interoperability with Solana smart contracts as well in 2024.\n\nSolana is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. Solana ecosystem took a hit due to market conditions and FTX situation last year as TVL fell from all-time high of +$9b to +$250m in July 2023 but since then it has shown strong growth and it’s the fastest growing ecosystem across major blockchain networks. Current TVL is over $1.5b making it the fifth-largest chain by TVL.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave has emerged as a prominent player in DeFi lending across various EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, including Ethereum, alt L1s, and L2s. Neon EVM wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Neon EVM Mainnet to expand lending to the Solana ecosystem. Aave’s expansion to the largest non-EVM ecosystem will further reinforce its place as the top liquidity market on-chain and open up possibilities for growth and collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and Neon EVM communities.\n\nAave V3 deployment on Neon EVM will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Solana and enables Solana ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through Neon EVM. The platform will allow Aave to deploy on Solana without any reconfiguration of the Aave v3 codebase and hence without incurring major development efforts and costs to the Aave DAO. Also, a third-party team has already deployed Aave V3 fork on Neon EVM Devnet which implies the full compatibility of Aave V3 codebase with Neon EVM.\n\nThese benefits of Neon EVM combined with Aave’s impressive push for a cross-chain future, provide an exciting opportunity to capture the market share of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and grow the user base and community of the protocol, increase TVL, and protocol revenue. At the same time, Neon EVM would benefit from having a trusted, flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users and wider Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe deployment of Aave v3 on the Neon EVM would enable Aave to tap into the Solana DeFi market and make a unique and significant contribution to the decentralized finance movement. This deployment is expected to substantially reduce costs and better scalability in comparison to EVM networks, while also providing users with access to Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. As Solana gains momentum as a prominent blockchain platform, the integration of Aave’s advanced lending and borrowing protocol could further catalyze the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and Neon EVM.\n\nThere have been significant concerns around the Downtime of Solana blockchain in the past but continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new tools are rolling out on a continuous basis to make the network more resilient, efficient and scalable. For e.g. Firedancer 2 by Jump Crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of Aave v3 deployment on Neon EVM was also recently mentioned by Stani and contributing teams like Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). Tweet by Stani 26, Tweet by Marc Zeller 25\n\nAdditionally, Neon EVM also recently announced the launch of Neon Points Program 10 to attract users and builders to accelerate the adoption of the network. We will include Aave in our points program to incentivize user activity on Aave v3 on Neon EVM with boosted points.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Mainnet with limited deployment of initial assets and conservative risk parameters.This approach will enable Aave to strategically establish a presence in the Solana ecosystem while minimizing risk exposure.\n\nThe proposal suggests three collaterals (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL 1) and one borrowable asset (USDC) with no isolated mode, e-mode enabled for correlated assets (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL), conservative LTV and supply, borrow caps. If this proposal is to pass, we will conduct a comprehensive technical risk assessment for the suggested assets at the ARFC phase to determine their risk parameters. We also invite risk service providers and community members to provide their analysis.\n\n# Infraestructure\n\n- Documentation: [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/quick_start)\n\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Neon EVM supports almost all standards. Here is the link to supported JSON-RPC - [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods)\n\n- Indexers: theGraph\n\n- Oracles: Chainlink, Pyth\n\n- Wallets: Metamask, Ledger and support other EVM network wallets.\n\n- Block explorers: [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/),  [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/)\n\n- Address formatting: It is the same as the standard Ethereum address.\n\n- On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Friendly fork of Gnosis Safe.\n\n- Cross-chain Interactions: [deBridge](https://debridge.finance/) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance/status/1737812739320599032), expected to go live on Mainnet in January)\n\n- NeonPass: NeonPass links Solana and Neon EVM to provide a smoother EVM-compatibility experience for end users (https://neonpass.live/). NeonPass is the revolving door of liquidity between Solana and Neon EVM. NeonPass is not a bridge connecting two separate blockchain ecosystems. Rather, it acts as a two-way transfer tool for bringing assets in and out of the Neon EVM platform, which itself is a Solana smart contract directly connected to the network.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Neon Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Neon Foundation and holds SOL, NEON tokens.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM and proceed with Snapshot if positive.\n\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n# Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard tBTC to Aave v3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n### **Author:  @Ethan - Threshold Network Growth Coordinator**\n\n### **Date: 2024-04-24**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\nThe proposal aims to onboard Threshold Network’s tBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism. tBTC is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin.\n\n## Motivation/Background:\n\ntBTC is Threshold’s decentralized and permissionless bridge to bring BTC to the Ethereum network. tBTC has been designed to allow Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum's Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.\n\nHaving recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).\n\nBenefits for Aave:\n\n* Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.\n* A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n* Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.\n* Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n* Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium's LTIPP.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\nContract Addresses:\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nEthereum: 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\nOptimism: 0x5a61374950D4BFa5a3D4f2CA36FC1d23A92b6f21\n\nUseful Links (the number of posted links is limited to 5 for new users, hence the intended spacing between \"h\" and \"ttps\"):\n\nProject: h ttps://www.threshold.network/\n\nMinting dashboard: h ttps://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint\n\nGitHub: h ttps://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2\n\nDocs: h ttps://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2\n\nAudit: h ttps://threshold.network/about#audits\n\nImmunfi Bug Bounty: h ttps://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\nLlama Risk Report: https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/tBTC\n\nTwitter: h ttps://twitter.com/thetnetwork\n\nDiscord: h ttps://discord.gg/threshold\n\nDune: h ttps://dune.com/threshold/tbtc & h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n\n#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThreshold Network has no link and is not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal.\n\n#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by native BTC. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for native BTC without a centralized custodian. It can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\ntBTC can be used as collateral, liquidity, a store of value, and can be integrated with DeFi apps across all supported blockchains.\n\nAs with other BTC wrappers, tBTC provides cryptocurrency traders and general users with a BTC-pegged token, that can be used to generate yield whilst holding native BTC.\n\n#### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nAdding support for tBTC on Aave V3 as an asset would allow tBTC holders to obtain a yield on their tBTC holdings.\n\nIn Aave’s [document hub](https://docs.aave.com/hub/), the first line self-describes Aave as “a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol”, Threshold Network is looking to help Aave fully realise this by allowing access to tBTC, which unlike its centralized competitor (wBTC), is the only way to permissionlessly borrow and lend BTC in a decentralized manner. This gives Aave direct access to the 1.3 trillion market and 106 million owners of BTC, for which wBTC provides limited access to.\n\n#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n#### How is tBTC currently used?\n\ntBTC is currently used across the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon and Solana ecosystems. tBTC exhibits strong usecase across decentralized exchanges, lending on Solana and Bitcoin Options on Base and as collateral for crvUSD, a broad overview can be found here:\nhttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\n\n#### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation\n\nThe Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:\n\nCouncil Multisig Ethereum Address: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\n#### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $195,000,000 USD / 2,960 BTC\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools: h ttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\nDashboard on Decentralized LP liquidity: h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n#### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 7,251\nTwitter: 37,200\nGithub: 4,596 commits\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of Deployment: February 2023\nNumber of transactions: 27,986\nNumber of token holders: 756\n\n#### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams, we suggest the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nSymbol: TBTC\n\nContract Addresses\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|N/A|\n|Borrow Cap|2 Million USD|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|35%|\n|LT|78%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Threshold Network.

        "body": "---\n\n### [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Aptos Mainnet \n### Author: @AptosFoundation\n###  Date: 2024-07-01\n\n---\n### Summary:\n\nThis Temperature Check seeks community input on deploying Aave V3 on Aptos to expand Aave’s presence and tap into Aptos’ growing DeFi ecosystem and user base.\n\n### Background:\n\nThe Aave Protocol has been EVM-native for over 6 years, ensuring widespread cross compatibility, a robust developer ecosystem, and significant network effects over the years both in terms of user base and liquidity. However, it also brings limitations, especially considering the existence of many non-EVM blockchains that offer different advantages such as lower transaction fees, higher throughput, and more advanced consensus mechanisms. In addition to purely technical advantages, many non-EVM blockchains can allow the Aave community to expand to an entirely new ecosystem, previously inaccessible user groups, and introduce new product possibilities.\n\nAptos is a blockchain designed for building scalable and secure dApps. Developed by former leaders of Meta's Diem blockchain project, it aims to address some of the limitations in existing blockchain systems such as throughput, scalability, and security. With a TVL of approximately $350m and growing rapidly, Aptos is the 17th largest chain by TVL (source: [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Aptos)). Its robust infrastructure offers high transaction throughput, low, predictable fees, and advanced security through the [Move programming language](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/why-move), that make Aptos an ideal platform for DeFi applications. The chain has a diverse array of [DeFi](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/defi) offerings, including prominent projects like Thala, Aries Markets, Amnis Finance, Econia, alongside primarily EVM-native projects such as Sushiswap and Pancake Swap. Aptos Labs Founders Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching have leveraged their extensive experience at Meta to propel Aptos towards becoming a leader in scalable and secure blockchain solutions. Moreover, Aptos has established high-profile partnerships with industry giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft, SK Telecom and many more others, further enhancing its technological capabilities and broadening its influence.\n\n*Advantages of Aptos*\n\nAptos offers several significant advantages that make it an ideal platform for high-demand applications. With its ability to handle over [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), it excels in supporting DeFi, real-time financial services, gaming, AI and other use cases. The platform's agile governance allows for rapid upgrades and swift implementation of new features. Additionally, Aptos ensures low and predictable fees through a stable fee model, and its use of the Move programming language enhances security with formal verification and resource-oriented programming. Built-in security features and automated auditing tools streamline the security process, while advanced state management techniques optimize data storage and access. Furthermore, Aptos simplifies integration with other blockchains through built-in interoperability, creating a cohesive and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos represents a groundbreaking expansion as it marks Aave’s first deployment on a non-EVM blockchain. This strategic move is significant as it opens up new technological frontiers, diversifies Aave’s ecosystem, and underscores its commitment to innovation.\n\nBy leveraging Aptos’ innovative technology and developer community, Aave can address diverse financial needs, attract new users, and drive greater innovation in the DeFi sector. This deployment aligns with the Aave community’s strategic goal to explore new technological possibilities and tap into a wider pool of talent and resources.\n\nKey benefits of deploying Aave V3 on Aptos include:\n\n1. First Non-EVM Deployment:\n\n  * This deployment is a significant milestone as Aave’s first move beyond EVM-compatible blockchains. It positions Aave to explore and integrate with new blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its resilience and broadening its reach.\n\n2. Early Mover Advantage and Strong Brand:\n\n  * Aave is a leading brand in the DeFi space, with a strong reputation and market share. By deploying on Aptos, Aave captures early mover advantages on a high-performance blockchain, similar to its strategic expansions to Polygon and other L2s. This can attract both seasoned DeFi users and new participants exploring Aptos.\n\n3. Aptos' Strategic Position:\n\n  * The Aptos team, with their background from Meta's Diem project, has strong connections and expertise in finance, social and gaming sectors. Integrating Aave into Aptos complements these areas by adding a mature financial layer, essential for a complete blockchain ecosystem.\n\n4. High Transaction Throughput:\n\n  * Aptos supports up to [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), crucial for DeFi protocols like Aave that handle a high volume of transactions, including loans, repayments, and interest accruals. This high throughput can significantly enhance user experience and enable new use cases that require high-frequency transactions.\n\n5. Enhanced Security with Move Language:\n\n  * Aave v3 introduces sophisticated risk management tools and improved security protocols. The Move programming language used by Aptos has inherent security advantages, such as preventing reentrancy attacks. This alignment can lead to a more secure DeFi lending environment, leveraging Move's safety features and formal verification.\n\n6. Transaction Cost Efficiency:\n\n  * Aave v3 focuses on gas efficiency, critical for reducing transaction costs. Aptos' efficient processing capabilities further complement this by potentially lowering transaction fees even more. This makes Aave more accessible and attractive to a broader range of users, from retail participants to institutional players.\n\n7. Modular and Flexible Architecture:\n\n  * Aave v3's modular and flexible architecture facilitates easier upgrades and expansions. Aptos supports upgradable smart contracts and a flexible account model, enhancing this aspect. This allows for seamless implementation of updates and improvements without significant disruptions or migrations.\n\n8. Economic Benefits for the Aave DAO:\n\n  * Market Share Growth: Access to new markets and user bases, specifically in APAC and Korea where Aptos has a strong presence.\n  * Revenue Growth: New markets and user bases can significantly increase transaction volumes and generate additional revenue streams.\n  * Incentives: Aptos Foundation has committed to provide up to 2M APT in liquidity mining incentives and rewards depending on performance in order to attract users and liquidity providers, increase adoption and boost the ecosystem’s growth. Aptos Foundation will work closely with Chaos Labs on determining the appropriate level of incentives relative to caps set.\n\nThe Move implementation on-going development code of Aave Protocol V3 can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/aptos-aave-v3).\n\nThe Aptos team is currently working with Aave Labs, Zellic, SpearBit and later in time with Certora and OtterSec on security reviews and improvements to the codebase to achieve high security standards. Aptos is sponsoring the audits.\n\n### ChainLink Integration:\n\nWe plan to integrate with ChainLink’s Price Feeds as the oracle provider for the market (currently in development), and with the recently [announced](https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/aptos-network-chainlink-data-feeds) Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enhance the functionality and security of Aave on Aptos.\n\nAsset and parameter settings would be discussed during ARFC.\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal published by the Aptos Foundation is intended for community feedback and does not represent a final decision. The deployment of Aave V3 on Aptos is subject to successful completion of all technical reviews, audits, and governance approvals. Aave Labs has built substantial expertise in the Move programming language and is prepared to proceed with the deployment pending community approval and further development steps. Aave Labs has been engaged as a technical contributor to implement the code version of the Aave Protocol into the Move programming language. Any actions taken based on this proposal should consider the inherent risks associated with blockchain deployments, including but not limited to technical, operational, and market risks. The information provided in this proposal is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial, legal, or technical advice.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal",
