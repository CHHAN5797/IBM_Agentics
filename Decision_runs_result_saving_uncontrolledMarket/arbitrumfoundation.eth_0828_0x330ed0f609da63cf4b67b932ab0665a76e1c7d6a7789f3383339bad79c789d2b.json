        "body": "# AIP: ArbOS Version 11\n\n# Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis AIP introduces a number of improvements to Arbitrum chains, including support for the EVM Shanghai upgrade and the PUSH0 opcode, along with miscellaneous bug fixes. These improvements are now audited and ready for adoption, including by Arbitrum Orbit chains, Arbitrum One, and Arbitrum Nova. This proposal concerns the latter two, as they are governed by the Arbitrum DAO. On a high level an ArbOS upgrade can be seen as Arbitrum's equivalent of a hardfork - more can be read about the subject over in https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-arbos-upgrades/19695\n\n## Changes Included\n\n### 1. EVM Shanghai support (including the PUSH0 opcode)\n\nRecent versions of go-ethereum already includes support for the changes to the EVM made in the Shanghai L1 upgrade, but we need to enable them for Arbitrum chains. Instead of using a time based activation, it’s better to activate support based on the ArbOS version, which makes sure that even if the upgrade is delayed, Shanghai support will take effect uniformly and without causing divergences with out of date node software.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1583 \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1664  \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1712\n\n### 2. Retryable fixes\n\nRetryable fees previously always used the network fee account, instead of also using the infrastructure fee account. The infrastructure fee account should be paid fees from the basefee, and the network fee account should be paid any surplus fees when the gas price is elevated. That was correctly implemented for normal transactions, but retryables only dealt with the network fee account. Retryable redemption also reported an incorrect gas usage in the block header. This matters to Arbitrum Nova, where the infrastructure fee account pays out some fees to the Data Availability Committee members, but the network fee account does not.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1789\nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1980\n\n### 3. Fix the chain owner list returned by precompile\n\nThis change doesn’t affect the actual chain owner set, but the list being returned by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile was incorrect for Arbitrum Nova due to an internal ArbOS issue. To be clear, this does not affect who was able to make chain owner actions. As intended, only the DAO is able to make chain owner actions on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova. This change only affects the list of chain owners presented by the ArbOwnerPublic precompile.\n\nPRs: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1525\nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1768\n\n### 4. Fix some precompile methods taking up all gas when reverting\n\nSome precompile methods such as ArbSys’s arbBlockHash method took up all gas when reverting. That meant that if a transaction called arbBlockHash with an out-of-range block number, it’d use up all the gas when reverting.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1490\n\n### 5. Create missing precompile methods to view some L1 pricing parameters\n\nThe L1RewardReceipient and L1RewardRate were previously not exposed via precompiles. This change adds methods to get them to ArbGasInfo so that the current chain configuration can be easily checked.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1775\n\n### 6. Fix the possibility of a staticcall from the owner to ArbOwner emitting a log\n\nThis shouldn’t matter in practice, but it was theoretically for a staticcall from the chain owner to the ArbOwner precompile to emit a log. In the EVM, staticcalls should never be able to emit logs. This PR fixes the Arbitrum precompile logic to disallow emitting logs in staticcall contexts.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1562\n\n### 7. Fix default L1 pricing params\n\nThis shouldn’t matter for Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, because these parameters were already corrected in [AIP-7](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-7-arbitrum-one-governance-parameter-fixes/15920). However, it’s included in ArbOS version 11 so that any Arbitrum Orbit chains automatically get the correct parameters.\n\nPR: \nhttps://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/1549\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe canonical version of ArbOS 11 this proposal aims to adopt is implemented in the Arbitrum Nitro git commit hash  `df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d`\n\nThat commit builds a WASM module root of `0xf4389b835497a910d7ba3ebfb77aa93da985634f3c052de1290360635be40c4a`, which is a hash of the code that’s put on-chain for fraud proofs. You can verify this WASM module root on a x86_64 computer (i.e. not on ARM which builds slightly different symbol names) with Docker setup by checking out the previously mentioned commit of the nitro repository, running `git submodule update --init --recursive`, and then running `docker build . --target module-root-calc --tag wavm-machine && docker run --rm wavm-machine cat /workspace/target/machines/latest/module-root.txt` This uses Docker to perform a reproducible build of the WebAssembly code used in fraud proofs, and outputs its hash.\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uwA1PK3AB9ggHMqaw91mubu5WHcEp398/view?usp=sharing\n\n### Upgrade Action smart contracts\n\nThe Action smart contracts used to execute the on-chain upgrade can be viewed in \n\nhttps://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/170\n\nAction contract addresses:\n[SetArbOneArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe8e5dc1793d6fe39452ddcb90d12997fa39de1de#code)\n[SetNovaArbOS11ModuleRootAction](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B125347f3B0790197d5247f32f91fd3e7140eD7#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF6c7Dc6eaE78aBF2f32df899654ca425Dfa99481#code)\n[SetArbOS11VersionAction](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x5357f4d3e8f8250a77bcddd5e58886ad1358220c#code)\n\n\nThe above code has audited by Trail of Bits - the audit report can be viewed in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N3197Z7DuqBpu9qdt-GWPewe8HQakfLY/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n\n### Verifying the ArbOS Code Difference\n\nThe current ArbOS version used on Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova is ArbOS 10, corresponding to the Arbitrum Nitro `consensus-v10` git tag. You can verify this by running the previously mentioned steps to build the WASM module root on that git tag, which produces the WASM module root `0x6b94a7fc388fd8ef3def759297828dc311761e88d8179c7ee8d3887dc554f3c3`, which is what the rollup contract’s `wasmModuleRoot()` method returns for both Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova.\n\nTo audit the code difference from ArbOS 10 to ArbOS 11, you could simple generate a full nitro diff with `git diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d` (and also generate a diff of the go-ethereum submodule mentioned in that nitro diff). However, that includes a lot of code that isn’t part of the WASM module root. To filter down to just the replay binary which defines the state transition function, you can start by generating a list of files in the nitro and go-ethereum repositories included by the replay binary in either ArbOS 10 or ArbOS 11 with bash:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nset -e\nmkdir -p ~/tmp # this script uses ~/tmp as scratch space and output\n# this script should be run in the nitro repository\ngit checkout df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nmake solgen\ngo list -f \"{{.Deps}}\" ./cmd/replay | tr -d '[]' | sed 's/ /\\\\n/g' | grep 'github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/' | sed 's@github.com/offchainlabs/nitro/@@' | while read dir; do find \"$dir\" -type f -name '*.go' -maxdepth 1; done | grep -v '_test\\\\.go\n```\n\nNow, `~/tmp/replay-binary-dependencies.txt` contains a list of dependencies of the replay binary that were present in ArbOS 10 or 11. To use that to generate a smaller diff of the nitro repository, you can run:\n\n```\ngit diff consensus-v10 df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d -- cmd/replay $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-nitro-dependencies.txt)\n```\n\nFor the go-ethereum submodule, you can first find out what go-ethereum commit ArbOS 10 and 11 used:\n\n```\n$ git ls-tree consensus-v10 go-ethereum                                                                                                                                                                                           128 ↵\n160000 commit 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298  go-ethereum\n$ git ls-tree df93361a1293574903f28fbbbe0469a3ea5c644d go-ethereum\n160000 commit abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de  go-ethereum\n```\n\nThose commit hashes are the go-ethereum commit hashes pinned by each nitro commit. Then, you can again use `git diff` and the files generated by the earlier script to generate a diff limited to code used by the replay binary:\n\n```\ngit diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt)\n```\n\nThis diff also includes the diff between upstream go-ethereum versions v1.10.25 and v1.11.6, as ArbOS 10 used the former and ArbOS 11 uses the latter. To filter out that difference, you can use this tool to find the intersection of two git diffs: https://gist.github.com/PlasmaPower/795af590f88cfb5e21c5ad9b8a32afdf\n\nWe can use that to find the intersection of the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-ethereum against ArbOS 10’s go-ethereum and the diff of ArbOS 11’s go-etheruem against upstream go-ethereum v1.11.6:\n\n```\ngit diff 941aa323e5cbbde1d5806eb4e3dd70553c5a1298 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff\ngit diff v1.11.6 abe584818e104dd5b4fdb8f60381a14eede896de -- $(cat ~/tmp/replay-binary-geth-dependencies.txt) > ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\ndiff-intersection.py ~/tmp/arbos-10-vs-11-geth.diff ~/tmp/arbos-11-vs-upstream-geth.diff\n```\nIn addition, you can pass the following arguments to `diff-intersection.py` to ignore files that are included by the replay binary but whose components are not used: `--ignore-files 'core/blockchain*.go' arbitrum_types/txoptions.go 'rawdb/**' 'rpc/**'`\n\nNote that by default, `diff-intersection.py` does a line based intersection. To instead do an intersection based on chunks in the diff, known as hunks in git terminology, you can add the `--only-hunks` flag.",

        "title": "Proposal: Building the Future of NFTs: The Rarible Protocol - Arbitrum Integration Proposal [REVISED]",
        "author": "0x1B686eE8E31c5959D9F5BBd8122a58682788eeaD",
        "body": "Category: Non-constitutional\nProposer: RARI Foundation\n\n## Abstract\nThe Rari Foundation is submitting a proposal to jumpstart the growth in the Arbitrum NFT ecosystem. The proposal involves integrating Arbitrum One with the open-source Rarible Protocol, which is an indexer, order book, and SDK powering NFT-based applications, which, once integrated, can be freely and easily used by the Artbitrum builders.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is hard for independent developers to build NFT-based applications due to a lack of easy-to-use tooling and infrastructure. Without this support, the developer community will opt for other chains with more robust support for building.\n\nOptimism vs. Arbitrum NFT stats as of July 27, 2023, indicate Arbitrum is not the first choice for the creation of NFT assets or contracts. Source: [NFT Scan 3](https://arbitrum.nftscan.com/).\n\n![98d064c39ba85a45bcb0c4831594150174c0ad8c_2_1380x364.png](ipfs://bafkreibumjn6k4xpmflli2bplvqr73mph4t6uuhrzvrzwuw7izhdcnkll4)\n \n![54086dc9319855e9a48199d7ee4860def6b9399b_2_1380x360.png](ipfs://bafkreieaxoqoikmypdsggspy5vjlqzajm4iod2kq5ib5k5n4ouqpoybsrm)\n\nThe open-source Rarible Protocol is focused explicitly on the NFT use case and will enable builders to develop their next dapps choosing Arbitrum, resulting in bringing in new Arbitrum users and sequencer revenue.\n\nThe Rarible Protocol is a trusted choice as it’s community governed, has an easy-to-use API, a comprehensive SDK, and is committed to expanding its capabilities to power innovative NFT use cases. Furthermore, the Protocol is used by [Rarible.com](https://rarible.com/) NFT marketplace, whose brand and community can be leveraged in raising awareness about Arbitrum venturing deeper into NFT tooling. Such signaling to the market will show that the Arbitrum community is serious about growing its ecosystem and flourishing NFTs. Rarible and the Rari Foundation will promote the integration in a cross-marketing push to ensure the NFT and crypto community knows that Arbitrum is serious about NFT growth. This support will consist of (and shall not be limited to):\n\n* Regular features on [Rarible.com](https://rarible.com/) 1 top spotlight section (1 million MAU)\n* Dedicated social support for the launch on Rarible’s and Rari Foundation’s owned channels (Twitter, Instagram, Discord, 800k+ followers combined)\n* Email blasts for the integration (500k+ subscribers)\n* Leveraging Rarible’s and Rari Foundation’s press relations\n* Potentially a hackathon\n\nThis proposal is being submitted outside of the pending grants framework in order to implement the integration asap, as waiting for the grants framework would result in significant implementation delays. As such, the Arbitrum DAO has an opportunity to express its willingness to incentivize ecosystem growth via strategic partnerships.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe proposed AIP aligns with the Arbitrum community’s mission and guiding values by enhancing the utility, scalability, and inclusivity of the Arbitrum network. The Rarible Protocol, a decentralized toolset for NFT applications, is open-source and free, mirroring Arbitrum’s commitment to technical inclusivity and neutrality.\n\nBy integrating Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol, we empower developers to create more complex and innovative applications on Arbitrum. This integration increases accessibility to real-time and historical Arbitrum blockchain data, aligning closely with Arbitrum’s commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Rari Foundation: The legal entity for the Rari DAO community that is in possession of $RARI Treasury and on the path of possession of the Rarible Protocol\n\nRarible Inc.: A leading NFT marketplace that allows users to mint, buy, and sell NFTs. One of the applications using the Rarible Protocol.\n\nRarible Protocol: Open-source, free-to-use, community-governed Protocol (which includes an SDK, indexer, and order book) for the creation, transaction, and distribution of NFTs.\n\nRarible SDK: A part of the Rarible Protocol that provides a set of tools for developers to interact with multiple blockchains\n\nA few notes on the [Rarible Protocol](https://rarible.org/):\n* It is an open-source, EVM-based SDK and multichain indexer that currently powers 4,000+ NFT marketplaces (including [Rarible.com](https://rarible.org/), and a series of non-marketplace-based applications (like wallets and NFT analytics services - see more use cases [here](https://docs.rarible.org/use-cases/use-cases-overview/)).\n* Designed as a set of building blocks, the Rarible protocol empowers the creation of fully customized NFT experiences of any level and complexity. ️\n* API access is lightning-fast, unified, and comprehensive. You gain seamless access to NFT Items, Collections, Activities, and NFT Metadata across multiple blockchains, including ETH, POL, IMX, FLOW, and TEZ, to name a few —all consolidated within a single endpoint.\n* The Protocol’s indexer is the fastest on the market. It retrieves blockchain data through fast APIs, eliminating the need for your own indexer and reducing costs associated with maintaining Blockchain Nodes.\n* User-friendly SDK allows you to connect wallets seamlessly, mint NFTs, put them up for sale, purchase NFTs, showcase collections, and so much more. The Protocol is the feature-rich product on the market (you can do anything NFT related on our Protocol).\n* Comprehensive Marketplace Support: Our platform offers unrivaled support for various marketplaces, providing access to aggregated order books from major platforms like OS, LR, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and Tezos, so you can ensure your users have access to the most competitive listings in the market.\n* Cutting-Edge NFT API Integration: We pride ourselves on providing the best NFT API support, seamlessly integrating with popular communication tools such as Discord, Zendesk, VIP support, Slack, and TG.\n* Powerful Analytics Capabilities: Our platform boasts best-in-class analytics tools, including OLAP statistics and floor price analysis, empowering users with valuable insights into market trends and performance.\n* Unmatched Reliability: We maintain the highest level of reliability, ensuring a remarkable 99.99% uptime for our Protocol, making us the most dependable choice in the market.\n\n## Specifications\nBelow is a detailed breakdown of how the integration will take place and the platforms and technologies that will be used.\n\n### Rarible Protocol: Integrating Arbitrum One\nThe Rarible Protocol is a decentralized toolset that allows developers to build NFT applications. It includes smart contracts, an indexer, an SDK, and APIs. The integration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol will extend these capabilities to the Arbitrum ecosystem, enhancing its utility and inclusivity.\n\n1. Rarible Arbitrum SDK\n - The Rarible SDK will expedite Arbitrum application development. By extending the SDK to support Arbitrum One, we will provide developers with tools for interacting with smart contracts, supporting NFT operations like minting, transferring, and burning, and integrating with multiple wallets.\n2. Rarible Orderbook & Smart Contracts\n - Our contracts, specifically the Rarible Exchange V2, will be deployed to the Arbitrum chain, granting access to our off-chain order book. Certain actions, such as canceling, confirming, updating, or when price changes occur, are on-chain, but orders are created off-chain.\n3. Rarible Public API\n - With the integration of Arbitrum One, the API will offer extended support for these chains, allowing developers to easily access and interact with NFT data on Arbitrum.\n4. Rarible Arbitrum Indexer\n - Rarible’s multichain indexer will be able to track and record NFT events on Arbitrum, providing developers with a comprehensive view of NFT activities on Arbitrum.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n### Arbitrum One integration into Rarible Protocol\n\nThe first key milestone will be integrating Arbitrum into the Rarible Protocol, which will set the foundation for future milestones involving building NFT applications on Arbitrum.\n\nTasks: Integration of Arbitrum One chain into Rarible Protocol\n\n* Arbitrum API Integration: This task involves integrating the Arbitrum API into the Rarible Protocol API to support Arbitrum One.\n* Node Preparation: A separate node for Arbitrum will be set up for rapid indexing upon approval\n* Contract Deployment: The Rarible Shared NFT, Rarible Factory (for creating collections), and Rarible ExchangeV2 contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum for users to interact with.\n* Orderbook: Rarible’s order book will be able to store listings, orders, and bids made with the Protocol\n* Arbitrum Indexer: Index NFT contracts, ERC-721/1155, ERC-20 tokens, Exchange orders & bids (from Seaport & Rarible).\n* Arbitrum support on Rarible Multichain SDK: This involves adding a new blockchain, connectors to wallets, and ensuring functionality similar to ETH/Polygon.\n* Debugging and Testing: General debugging of all components will be conducted, along with testing on production with OpenSea orders.\n* Build Testnet for Arbitrum: An additional environment for the testnet will be set up, including indexing, reindexing, etc.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe tentative timeline consists of 7 weeks, 5 of which are the integration phase. If the proposal is approved by early September 2023, the project implementation can be executed in early Q4 2023.\n\n![f2c50222937695d8622cbfc5429a99a48c1efaab_2_1380x274.png](ipfs://bafkreidspk3ghv2f32w5jfvtidmypu32j4pmzyf4lius3zl2nflisd2xsm)\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nAs the integration of the Rarible Protocol and Arbitrum will benefit both ecosystems, we are offering to split the Rarible Protocol integration costs between our two parties with an equal share.\n\nIntegration of Arbitrum One into the Rarible Protocol\n\nDuration: 5 Weeks\n\nCosts: 200,000 $ (Artibtrum portion = 100,000 $)\n\nPayment terms:\n* 50% payable upon proposal approval\n* 50% payable upon completion\n\nThe amount is payable in USDC or ETH.\n\nNote that the Rari Foundation will absorb costs related to the service and maintenance of the Protocol upkeep after the integration implementation.",

        "body": "## Abstract\nHome to some of the best smart contract security researchers in the market and one of the strongest Developer Relations teams in the industry - professionals in Cyfrin come from backgrounds like Chainlink, Compound, Alchemy, Aragon, WorldCoin, Microsoft, Google, and other popular FinTech companies.\n\nThrough this proposal, Cyfrin would like to request $2M to improve and foster the security and longevity of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe will do this through launching the Arbitrum Security Enhancement Fund dedicated to sponsoring audits for Arbitrum projects.\n\n## Motivation\nBlockchains solve global issues no other technology today has been able to solve: verifiable accountability, unbiased data exchange, trust without intermediaries, online ownership, permissionless transactions, global identities, to name a few…\n\nYet, until Web3 is safe, it is not scalable.\n\nIn July, total losses in the DeFi sector breached $77B according to a report from CryptoSlate. In 2022 alone, DeFi experienced hacks resulting in losses of over $3.1B. In 2023, a staggering $2.3B has already been stolen, indicating a trajectory higher than the previous year.\n\nThis is a security problem, a best practices problem, and a branding problem - rightfully keeping away institutions and users from a world-changing technology. Not solving this makes any effort of making web3 mainstream, vain.\n \n![7dbb9b4b71e82d06bc9ed50d172fbd4f740875d5.png](ipfs://bafkreig3zhjhipa7wcbmrhahe3smkhj6ytridrczvc4gizwkkkliyordde)\n    \nEvery time there is a hack on an Arbitrum project, both the Arbitrum ecosystem and the entire industry, suffer.\n\nGetting this right increases adoption at scale. Value exchange technologies without developers capable of using them appropriately have a hard time succeeding. Value exchange technologies with developers and protocols lacking security best practices create an unsafe environment for everyone participating.\n\n– The future of crypto hinders on projects prioritizing smart contract security.\n\nCyfrin commits to leveraging our team of industry experts to strengthen, support, and secure Arbitrum’s ecosystem and its developers.\n\n## Rationale\nLeveraging our auditing, engineering, and educational skill sets, the Cyfrin team will keep projects built on Arbitrum and its users safe. Through this proposal, Cyfrin aims to contribute to the long-term success of the Arbitrum ecosystem through attracting incoming TVL for the Arbitrum ecosystem, gain user trust, and show traction to potential future investors.\n\nLaser-focused on Web3 security, Cyfrin is a market leader in smart contract audits. Cyfrin offers everything from private audits to competitive public and private audits, as well as a multi-phase auditing approach we’ve designed to ensure stronger security guarantees.\n\n![eef6f8ad9af263c4f7d23396654d6993e05d7dcd.png](ipfs://bafkreigtdj7fs7vq3fy2jdavaghommp3ha5vrtd4727gvrqhmwipf6uptm)\n\nAdditionally, you may find case studies for Oku Trade and SudoSwap to learn more about how Cyfrin works.\n\nSome testimonials from clients:\n\n“It was a pleasure to work with the Cyfrin team. Their approach to security and meticulous testing is exceptionally thorough. Additionally, their intimate knowledge of the Chainlink protocol made them particularly useful for our audit.” - Getty Hill, Oku Trade Founder\n\n“Working with Cyfrin feels like a true partnership — they are just plain good at what they do and above all are as motivated as anyone to move our industry’s security practices forward” - Beanstalk\n\n“Working with Cyfrin was a good experience, they kept in touch throughout the entire audit, and also followed up post-launch. Competitive with the best of the firms.\" - 0xmons from Sudorandom Labs\n\nThrough this proposal, we’re asking Arbitrum to fund a Security Enhancement Fund to audit projects built on its infrastructure. The fund will allocate funds to private, competitive, or multi-phase audits for projects built on Arbitrum.\n\nCyfrin will power the long-term success of Arbitrum protocols, so protocols feel safer going to market and users more comfortable interacting with the Arbitrum chain.\n\n## Key Terms\nAudit: An audit is a service where a security researcher reviews a codebase in depth with the intent of finding potential vectors for exploitation. Once completed, a report is presented to the protocol to fix any potential vulnerabilities found.\n\nPrivate audit: A team, consisting of usually 2-3 security researchers, spends weeks looking at a protocol’s codebase with the aim of finding the most critical exploit vectors in a codebase, as well as perform architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, etc.\n\nPublic Competitive Audit: An audit where hundreds, if not thousands, of security researchers review a codebase and compete for funds in a set reward pool based on the complexity of vulnerabilities found, its impact, and its uniqueness.\n\nPrivate Competitive Audit: An invite-only audit where a protocol invites top-performing auditors to review their code and compete in community driven audit competition.\n\nMulti-Phase Audit: a new, innovative model known as the Diverge-Converge Multi-Phase Model. Crafted to maximize the quality of audits, a critical aspect in the Web3 space, by strategically incentivizing auditors and ensuring that the protocol codebase goes through at least three comprehensive auditing phases, enhancing the protocol’s ultimate security.\n\n## Specifications\nThe entirety of the funds will be allocated towards funding security reviews for protocols, including the costs to run the audits, hire auditors, promote contests, bring judges, do customer support, and competition moderation.\n\nThe Fund will match up to 60% for the audit requested. The remaining amount will have to be paid by the project itself requesting for funding. This is mostly to weed out projects just looking for a free audit, ensuring we’re truly enabling long-lasting impact for the ecosystem.\n\nThe one exception to this rule is projects who are already deployed on Arbitrum and who can prove a high number of active users, total value locked, or who provide user retention and stickiness across the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole. Establishing the details of what “high” means in this case will be a task of the Allocation Committee once formed.\n\nThese audits may come in the form of competitive audits, through our CodeHawks platform, private audits through our security research team, or through our multi-phased approach combining the above.\n\n## Audit Types\nCompetitive Audits\nCodeHawks, one of the leading competitive auditing platforms in the market and home to some of the top security experts in the industry, enhances the security of protocols through community-driven smart contract security reviews.\n\nOn CodeHawks, hundreds of auditors study, test, stress, and review the same protocol’s codebase for a defined amount of time - finding bugs and potential exploit vectors. Auditors then submit the findings to the platform for judge review and monetizing based on the vulnerabilities uncovered.\n\nPrivate Audits\nPrivate audits, an option tailored to yet-to-be deployed, and already-live protocols. A hand-in-hand relationship between protocol’s engineering team and our security research squad is formalized to uncover vulnerabilities and support developers with state-of-the-art best practices guidance.\n\nThrough constant communication, the protocol’s engineering team is able to revise vulnerabilities as soon as they’re found - ensuring the team can start working on fixes immediately. Auditors also provide architecture analysis, fuzz testing, improvement pull reviews, specific knowledge like formal verification, code smells, testing feedback, etc.\n\nMulti-phase Audits\nDesigned for large and more complex protocols, the Multi-Phase audit approach has the stronger security guarantee of them all since it encourages the protocol to go through several audit phases before completing the final report.\n\nTo learn more about the Multi-Phase Audits, review here. \n\n![94de3d610083fec1fdc4d0cd35c1720832865f5b.png](ipfs://bafkreiauxpn2v4ymg4djs22mshbdtzucp73zr62byswrmto5dzr7fzqloq)\n\n## Allocation Committee\nThe Allocation Committee is the group responsible for determining which projects should receive audit funding. Cyfrin will lead the charge of setting this Committee up within 2 weeks of proposal approval.\n\nThe multisig account for the Allocation Committee will contain 5 people (3 from Arbitrum’s side, 2 from Cyfrin). Each team (Cyfrin and Arbitrum) will select who from their organizations will represent them in the Allocation Committee within 10 days of proposal approval.\n\nOnce composed, the committee will determine any additional eligibility criteria and share them with the community before opening up the application funnel. The application funnel should open within a maximum of one month post proposal approval.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee is responsible for defining the appropriate application process and reviewing applications on a recurrent basis. The process for reviewing these applications, as well as how often the Committee meets will be determined by the members based on the amount of applications received and their complexity.\n\nWe saw the community gather together under the STIP proposal and would like the same community participatory process to guide the direction of how the fund allocates the distribution. It’s a discovery process that we will run, partnering with Arbitrum to validate findings and iterate repeatedly.\n\n## Eligibility criteria for protocols applying to the Security Enhancement Fund\nThe Security Enhancement Fund aims at improving the security of all projects that have already deployed or will be deploying into the Arbitrum chain.\n\nAny protocol that adds value to the Arbitrum ecosystem across DeFi, Gaming, DAOs, or social projects, real world assets tokenization, track and trace solutions, or any other track, bringing a healthy and sustainable contribution to the ecosystem, is welcomed to apply.\n\nProjects should have already deployed to Arbitrum mainnet to apply, although exceptions can be made for:\n\nProtocols who commit to deploying on Arbitrum within 6 months of the audit - if this is the case, the code being audited must be deployed exclusively on Arbitrum for 6 months before launching elsewhere. The Allocation Committee will determine when taking such a risk is worth the assessment.\n\nProtocols who already have deployed and gained traction on other chains, looking to deploy to Arbitrum as well - if this is the case, information regarding the protocol’s TVL, active user base, and Arbitrum strategy should be shared in the application for review by the Allocation Committee.\n\n## Ineligible Projects\nIn an effort to keep the Arbitrum ecosystem secure and sustainable, we comply and leverage Arbitrum’s guidelines 2 to determine which projects are ineligible to apply for the Security Enhancement Fund.\n\nAdditionally, the Allocation Committee may establish additional guidelines for ineligible projects.\n\n## Security Enhancement Fund Distribution\nThe 100% of the funds from the Security Enhancement Fund will be used to audit Arbitrum projects.\n\nThe fund allocation per project will cover 60% of the protocol audit, expecting the protocol to cover the rest. The reasoning behind this is to ensure only protocols serious about their long-term growth get audited. However, an exception of sponsoring 80% of the audit could be made for unique situations as established by the Allocation Committee, like for a protocol amounting for large ecosystem growth or a large protocol deploying to Arbitrum.\n\nThis makes it extremely convenient for protocols built on Arbitrum to enhance the security of their codebase and protect users’ assets.\n\nAudit prices are aligned with industry standards and calculated based on the complexity of the codebase under review.\n\nFor competitive audits, the prize pool is calculated as approximately $30 multiplied by the number of lines of code in the code base.\n\nFor private audits, the cost is calculated as $60,000 multiplied by the number of weeks required by the auditors to read, understand, and review the code base in scope. The time required for each audit is evaluated before the security review by the lead auditor assigned to the project and will be made publicly available to the community.\n\nProtocols are permitted to undergo one or multiple smart contract security reviews per protocol update. The number of reviews is determined based on the codebase size, as indicated below:\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with less than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 1 per type.\n\nFor codebases or protocol updates with more than 5000 nSloc, security reviews will be limited to 2 per type.\n\nnSloc is an objective measure and industry that stands for Normalized Source Code. Calculated reducing all multiline functions declarations to a single line, removing all comments and empty lines and counting the remaining number of lines of code.\n\nWhatever allocation we don’t spend, at the end of the year we will return to the DAO for further use.\n\n## Steps to implement\nWithin the next year, the Cyfrin team commits to:\n\n1. Technical implementation of creating the Allocation Committee’s multisig and define its members\n2. Allocation Committee details eligibility requirements and allocation criteria\n3. Define and implement process for protocols to apply for audits alongside the Allocation Committee\n4. Review applications and start distributing funds strategically for protocols who meet the criteria\n5. Pair auditors with protocols\n6. Kick-off auditing process\n7. Amplify the Security Enhancement Fund as a great reason for projects to choose Arbitrum as their L2 of choice, as well as promotion of the protocols Cyfrin audits\n8. Final report to protocols\n\n– Keep in mind, this process may vary depending on whether the protocol is undergoing a private, competitive or multi-phase audit.\n\n## Team\nPatrick Collins: Cyfrin’s CEO and former Lead of Chainlink DevRel, Patrick revolutionized the industry onboarding hundreds of thousands of developers into web3 with its courses and speeches, with more than 3 million views on his courses and ~160.000 subscribers across platforms.\n\nAlex Roan: Cyfrin’s CTO, Alex is a veteran Web3 developer who has contributed to core DeFi infrastructure such as Chainlink and Compound - securing billions of dollars in value.\n\nHans Friese: Cyfrin Lead Auditor and Co-founder, Hans is one of the world’s top auditors, consistently ranking at the top within competitive auditor leaderboards 2. He is also the founder and Lead Engineer of Solodit, the most used vulnerability aggregator tool for auditors.\n\nDon Dodge: tech veteran with a past in Google, Microsoft, Groove, Napster, AltaVista, and more. Startup investor, advisor, and board member.\n\nMark Scrine: previously the Strategic Lead for Proof of Reserve at Chainlink Labs and led a number of their biggest integrations. These included protocols such as TUSD, Matrix Port, Avalanche Bridge, BackedFi, and Swell Network.\n\nDeveloper Relations & Marketing: Our industry leading DevRel team will work together with the Arbitrum’s community to promote, educate, and onboard auditors into the Cyfrin ecosystem, advocating for audit quality for protocols. Additionally, through Cyfrin’s Education platform, our DevRel team is brewing the next generation of software engineers into the space with Arbitrum as their L2 of choice. Composed of 6 people total, here’s an example of some of the leaders in our team:\n\nVitto Rivabella, formerly leading Developers Experience at Alchemy, the popular Web3 infrastructure provider, and Alchemy University, educating tens of thousands of Web3 developers. Web3 educator, investor, developer, public speaker and a former VFX supervisor.\n\nJuliette Chevalier, former Lead of Developer Relations at Aragon and Co-founder of Surge Women, an organization bridging the educational gap between women and crypto products. She is also a key contributor to various DAOs, angel investor, software engineer, and public speaker.\n\nCommunity Manager: Our Community Manager will foster peer-to-peer relationships and manage technical support for the students going through the Arbitrum courses - a vital resource for community members seeking assistance and supporting CodeHawks auditors to do their best work.\n\nDesign: Our design team will create visually engaging and user-friendly materials, enhancing the overall learning experience for the Abitrum developer community and CodeHawks auditors.\n\nCodeHawks Team: The CodeHawks team together with Cyfrin will run, promote, judge, support and moderate the competitions and the community, onboarding and assisting the protocols looking to onboard on Arbitrum. Once the team has made sure the protocol respects the eligibility criteria, they will manage the entire cycle from start to finish. This includes sales (answering to active inbounds, and protocols suggested by the community), contest details, marketing, judging, and final report submission.\n\nAudit Team: Our team of security researchers are experts across a variety of fields like DeFi, oracles, Web3 social, and more. They come from the industry’s top auditor leaderboard and are dedicated entirely to the private audits.\n\n## Cost\nThe budget for this proposition totals $2 million.\n\nThe entirety of the funds is dedicated towards the sponsoring of audits for protocols deployed or deploying on Arbitrum.\n\nThe entirety of the funds will be expected upon proposal approval to maintain a rapid response to audit requests and safeguard protocol integrity.\n\nUpon the onchain approval of the proposal, these funds will be transferred to the Allocation Committee’s multi-sig, as set up by Cyfrin containing the 2 Cyfrin Committee representatives. The multi-sig’s first transaction will then add the 3 Arbitrum representatives before transferring any funds to protocols.\n\nAdditionally, Cyfrin suggests the Allocation Committee reimburses the DAO quarterly in the event that the minimum expected capital for that quarter ($500,000) isn’t spent within that time period. This will also enable a tangible oversight mechanism for the DAO to ensure Cyfrin is doing the expected work.\n\n## Why $2M?\n\nAt an average cost of $60,000, sponsored at 60%, $2M would cover anywhere from 20-25 audits in the span of a year.\n\nAlthough the cost of an audit varies widely based on codebase size, complexity, and audit type, audit prices typically range between $30,000-$100,000, with an average audit being ~$60,000.\n\nAssuming the Fund covers 60% of the audit, $2M are estimated to cover anywhere from 20-25 audits within the span of a year. Additionally, 70% of the fund will be used to cover existing protocols on Abitrum, with the remaining 30% used to cover new protocols launching on the chain.\n\n– Important to note that in order to have the best possible security for a protocol, projects often go through 2 or more audits - including private and competitive audits. Particularly for complex projects already holding a high TVL, a multi-phase audit is highly advised to decrease the chances of an exploit to an absolute minimum.\n\nConsidering Arbitrum is believed to have 1.2M total commits and over 1,100 Arbitrum repositories, with over 450 active developers, this fund would cover ~10% of Arbitrum’s development.\n\n https://www.developerreport.com/ecosystems/arbitrum\n\n## Framework on payments, reporting, and oversight\n\nCyfrin pledges to publish financial reports to the DAO to uphold transparency and accountability every quarter, outlining expenditure details, audits funded, decisions made, and progress updates. These reports will be posted in the Arbitrum DAO’s forum for the DAO to periodically review.\n\nSnapshot has a maximum character limit.

        "body": "**Changes Based on Feedback Since the Temperature Check Version (posted 20th Oct)**\n\n- For simplicity and security reasons, decided to forego the token mint aspect of the proposal entirely and fund staking with a treasury request instead. Using the mint to fund staking was deemed too circular and not a necessary step based on feedback.\n- Added the idea of the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ as a potential key partner to gather data and monitor the impacts of this staking mechanism over the next 12 months with the end goal of using these insights to refine the ARB staking mechanism further. This collaboration is reliant on the Arbitrum Coalition’s conditional funding.\n- Added an additional 1.25% voting option\n- Clarified that voting will be ranked choice voting with five different options\n\n**Changes Based on Feedback Since the RFC Version**\n\n- Added several options for voting - 1.75%, 1.5%, and 1%. Examples of APRs at different ARB staking percentages can be found later in the proposal.\n- The maximum lock penalty % has been changed from 80% to 60%.\n- Suggested that the implementation details (selecting a vendor and auditor) will be decided in a further proposal\n\n# Abstract\nThe Arbitrum DAO treasury is growing rapidly, yet that growth is not currently being shared with token holders. The Arbitrum DAO treasury address holds 3,54B ARB tokens, and an unexpected $69,4M of unclaimed individual ARB airdrops were recently returned to the DAO treasury. The treasury is exceptionally well funded, and it’s important to note that the DAO fully controls the usage of the Arbitrum DAO treasury and that all surplus revenues belong to the DAO. This includes sequencer revenues.\n\nWe believe that the Arbitrum token needs a staking mechanism. We propose creating a mechanism that distributes ARB to token lockers. A locking mechanism would incentivize long-term token holders and become a fundamental building block for future token utility proposals (e.g., distributing sequencer revenues).\n\nAlong with creating a locking mechanism, we propose requesting 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total ARB token supply from the Arbitrum DAO treasury and distributing this over 12 months through the proposed locking mechanism. The final amount would be decided with a Snapshot and that decision cemented on-chain with a Tally vote. We suggest that the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ gathers data and monitors the impacts of this staking mechanism over the 12-month period and potentially audits the contracts if funded in time. Of course, this relationship is reliant on both proposals passing and the DAO and Coalition Advocate supporting the scope of work for the coalition. The goal is to use these insights to give the DAO the data and tools to refine the ARB staking mechanism further.\n\nIt is important to note that this proposal is entirely separate from the ongoing liquidity incentives framework and grant discussion. Both can and should co-exist - Arbitrum should have a functional grants framework and a staking mechanism. The Arbitrum DAO STIP program has recently concluded, and 50M ARB tokens will enter the market over the coming months. As proposed here, a supply sink through staking would benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIn the discussions over the previous months, we’ve seen the legal aspect be a deterrent to sharing value with ARB token holders in the form of revenue. The way we are proposing the staking mechanism through using existing treasury funds to reward lockers in ARB is the most palatable option from a legal perspective, as it does not involve sharing revenues. It also does not rule out the possibility of later moving on to a model that allows for other value accrual methods to the token. Should our proposal pass, when additional value accrual methods are proposed and the legal landscape is more mature and better understood, the process will likely be much quicker since a staking mechanism is already in use with audited contracts in place.\n\nWe thank the following delegates and others for their valuable feedback while drafting this proposal.\n\nWestie from Blockworks Research\nCoinflipcanada\nAnd several others\n\n# Motivation\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem would benefit in multiple ways from a staking mechanism that is constructed to heavily align incentives with those most aligned with the ecosystem long-term. While staking mechanisms are familiar and a mainstay across DeFi, sustainable models and their impact on the token in question have been scarcely studied. These staking mechanisms are often poorly designed and have rampant inflation that negatively affects the token.\n\nRegarding staking mechanisms, there are few examples to model after in the Layer 2 token space. We propose that the Arbitrum ecosystem takes the first step in this endeavor and leads the way - as it already does in many other verticals. We believe that to construct a long-term staking mechanism that is sustainable, there is first a need to gather actual data that is strictly specific to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the ARB token.\n\nBecause of this, we propose that the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ monitors the effects of this 12-month staking experiment and provides quarterly updates on the impacts of the mechanism through dashboards and qualitative reporting. After the 12-month staking experiment is over, we suggest that the DAO funds the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ to produce a comprehensive report with results and recommendations on what they believe is the most sustainable way forward in building a staking mechanism and incentive model that is sustainable yet attractive for the ARB token. The expertise of the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ is perfectly suited for analyzing the results of this experiment, given that Gauntlet is an industry-leading authority in tokenomics design, Blockworks spearheads the industry’s research efforts and Trail of Bits is a top-tier security organization. To read more about the Arbitrum Coalition, please visit their proposal here.\n\n# Broader Implications for Arbitrum\nThis proposal passing would have extremely positive implications for the entire Arbitrum ecosystem. Having a native staking model that the DAO officially approves would be likely to have the following consequences:\n\n- Significantly increase interest in Arbitrum and the ARB token\n- Allow for composability around an ARB token that can earn yield\n- Reward long-term aligned stakers with yield while penalizing mercenary capital and short-term actors\n- Positively differentiate ARB from any other L2 tokens and bring the spotlight back to Arbitrum\n- Offer a first step and infrastructure towards introducing different forms of revenue sharing in the future\n\nThese are some of the benefits that will likely result from having a staking mechanism; however, verifying these predictions’ accuracy by an independent third party such as the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ is important. These hypotheses cannot be truly verified without actual data, highlighting the importance of a 12-month trial period for staking.\n\n# Benefits for Users\nBy introducing a staking contract that responsibly distributes the allotted amount of tokens to users who are willing to lock their ARB, the incentives are aligned in a way that rewards those parties most loyal to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes long-term holders of ARB and DAOs that have received an airdrop and are willing to lock their tokens.\n\nThe figures below detail possible APRs for stakers at different staked percentages if 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total supply was distributed annually. The current circulating supply of ARB is approximately 1.275B.\n\n![87f8dc9e506d60ebd15f3098d0ff626ee8453c71.png](ipfs://bafkreifv3akc3qub3mmknewbcjwchy2vc7astm2wp33occluoj4r576lu4)\n\n# Specification\n- The ARB staking contract will allow users to lock their ARB for up to 365 calendar days. A user’s weight is proportional to their lock time.\n- Users may increase their lock times.\n- Users may pause their lock times (meaning the time to unlock does not increase this saves having to relock continuously)\n- Users may have many independent locks.\n- Users will receive and may claim ARB emissions according to their weight.\n- Users may exit their lock for a penalty between 0-60% of their lock amount, linear vs. lock time remaining (365 days remaining would mean a 60% penalty, and 0 days would be a 0% penalty). This penalty is shared between remaining users according to weight.\n\nExample usage: ARB locker\n\n- The user locks 100 ARB for 365 days.\n   - The lock weight formula is (ARB amount locked * lock time / 365)\n   - Their ARB lock ‘weight’ is currently 100 (100 ARB * 365/365).\n   - All rewards are distributed based on a user’s weight / the total sum of all the users’ weights.\n- After 182.5 days, the user will have a lock ‘weight’ of 50 (100 ARB * 182.5/365).\n   - At this point, they may increase their lock time, do nothing, or withdraw.\n   - The early exit penalty is (0.6 * lock time / 365)%.\n   - For a lock time of 182.5 days, the penalty is, therefore, 30% of the locked amount - if the user were to withdraw now, they would receive back 70 ARB.\n- ARB staked in this contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. Why a locking mechanism?\n\nA locking mechanism allows users who are long-term believers in Arbitrum to signal this belief through their actions and get rewarded for it accordingly. Locking for longer is always optional - users may lock for any time period. One year is a reasonable lock time compared to the previously popular 4-year locking model. A one-year lock is not too long to the point of disincentiving locking, as users can choose the lock duration. Not only does this give individuals optionality and a mechanism to earn a native yield on their ARB tokens, but it also gives protocols that were a part of the DAO airdrop or have otherwise accumulated ARB a mechanism to earn on their treasury.\n\n2. What are the consequences of this proposal?\n\nUltimately, this proposal introduces utility to ARB and gives users more incentive to hold. In addition, long-term believers will be net increasing their network share, which sets up a base from which we can build further proposals for ARB value accrual without worrying about the distribution mechanism.\n\n3. What would this staking mechanism mean for delegation?\n\nFrom a user standpoint, it’s important to note that the ARB staked in the proposed contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length. The staking contract will be upgradeable and controlled by the DAO - this ensures that the DAO can pause this distribution at any time.\n\n# Summary\nAs it stands today, ARB has no native utility or yield. We propose approving the creation of the staking contract detailed above and distributing an equivalent of 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25%, or 1% of the total ARB supply from the DAO treasury to the staking contract. These tokens would be distributed over a 12-month period, during which the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ could - pending their proposal passing - monitor the impacts of the proposed staking mechanism and draft a report and recommendations by the end of the period. Note that the Arbitrum Coalition proposal is entirely separate yet synergistic to this proposal. The passing of either proposal is not conditional on the other proposal’s performance.\n\nIt’s important to highlight that to move toward a final and refined version of value accrual to the ARB token, trial and experimentation is required. We believe there is a strong need for actual data from a live staking mechanism, such as the one suggested in this proposal, from the unique context of Arbitrum’s growing ecosystem to make more informed decisions on what the ultimate mechanism for ARB staking and value accrual might look like.\n\nInnovation has always been Arbitrum’s forte in both technical advancements and building a vibrant community - we believe that the approach to building a cutting-edge staking model for ARB through trial and experimentation is a logical way forward.\n\n# Timeline\nThis proposal will follow the official lifecycle of an AIP detailed here. Please note that this proposal is a non-constitutional proposal.\n\nThe suggested timeline can be found below.\n\nWeek 36-37 - Forum post, request for comments and feedback (Complete)\nWeek 43-44 - Temperature check forum post & Snapshot poll (1 week)\nWeek 45 - Formal AIP and call-for-voting (3 days)\nWeek 45-46 - On-chain DAO vote on Tally (14 days)\nWeek 47 onwards - Implementation phase\n\nIf the proposal passes, a draft of the implementation phase is detailed below in “Suggested Steps to Implement.” The final implementation schedule depends on the result of the vendor decision proposal, community review, audit schedules, and subsequent findings. A concrete schedule for the implementation stage will thus be locked in at a later stage.\n\n# Voting Options on Snapshot\nWhen this proposal moves to Snapshot, there will be five voting options. The voting method will be ranked choice voting. To read more about ranked choice voting, please visit this article from Snapshot.\n\n1. Fund staking with 1.75% of the total ARB supply (175M ARB tokens)\n2. Fund staking with 1.5% of the total ARB supply (150M ARB tokens)\n3. Fund staking with 1.25% of the total ARB supply (125M ARB tokens)\n4. Fund staking with 1% of the total ARB supply (100M ARB tokens)\n5. Do not fund staking\n\n# Suggested Steps to Implement\n1. The Arbitrum DAO will receive another proposal concerning implementation, which will aim to decide the vendor of the implementation and associated contracts and an auditor.\n2. After the contracts and audits are finished, they will be provided to the community for review for two weeks.\n3. After the community review period, the contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum, and the ownership will be transferred to the DAO.\n4. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n# Costs\nThe costs of this proposal are mainly related to the implementation process, during which a vendor and auditor will be decided. The true extent of these costs can only be estimated after these decisions are made.",

        "body": "Non-Constitutional\n\nAbstract\nTLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",
