        "body": "Abstract:\nThis Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) is presented with the vision of further enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Acknowledging the STIP’s instrumental role in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, this proposal seeks to extend its positive impact by introducing a gas rebate and trading incentive program created by Rage Trade, a native perp aggregator on Arbitrum. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only complement the milestones achieved by the STIP but also to significantly increase the influx of new traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMotivation:\nAs the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) kicks off, it sets the stage for the Arbitrum ecosystem to experience amplified growth. The STIP is poised to play a pivotal role in promoting on-chain activities and reinforcing key protocols. However, there is plenty of opportunity to intensify user engagement and participation, especially when considering innovative platforms like Rage Trade.\n\nThis proposal is driven by the ambition to harness this potential, acting synergistically with the anticipated successes of the STIP. Through Rage Trade’s introduction of a gas rebate and trading incentive program, our objective is not just to elevate trading activity, but also to enhance the overall user experience, attracting and onboarding new traders to the ecosystem. This effort is geared towards empowering platforms that, in line with Arbitrum’s vision, are poised for growth but require additional support to maximize their contribution.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to foster a dynamic and engaged community. By allocating 100% of the grant funds to create a gas rebate and trading incentives program, Rage Trade’s platform aims to refine the user experience of traders while offering gas savings and trading incentives to stimulate a competitive yet cooperative environment.\n\nSpecifications: A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.\nRage Trade Platform:\n\nAs a prime broker and perpetual aggregator, Rage Trade unifies top decentralized perpetual exchanges across all EVM-compatible chains. It streamlines the trading experience by eliminating complexities associated with collateral and gas fund management, ensuring a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly environment for traders.\n\nGas Tank Mechanism:\n\nThe Gas Tank is a unique feature of Rage Trade that simplifies trading across different chains. Users deposit funds into their account, and a portion goes into the Gas Tank. This fund is then used to cover gas fees across various chains, eliminating the need for users to manage gas fees separately.\n\nSession-Based Trading System:\n\nRage Trade employs a session-based trading system where users create a session that lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days). This system reduces the need for manual transaction signing, making the trading experience smoother and more akin to centralized exchanges.\n\nMulti-Leg Trading and Auto-Populating Bridge:\n\nThe platform allows users to create multiple trades from different chains and perps on Arbitrum, enabling them to spread risk and optimize execution. Additionally, Rage Trade handles all the bridging details, automatically selecting the best bridge or swap routes for seamless trade execution.\n\nCustom Route Selection:\n\nUsers have the option to split their orders based on various criteria such as best execution price, lowest funding fees, or routes with bonuses like emissions or airdrops. This feature provides flexibility and optimization for trade execution.\n\nAggregated Referral & Competitions:\n\nRage Trade aggregates referrals and competitions across different perp protocols, allowing users to participate in various trading competitions and referral programs through a single platform.\n\nIncentive Distribution:\n\nThe proposal involves the distribution of 1.5 million ARB tokens to incentivize trading volume on Rage Trade. The distribution will be structured to reward active traders and participants in trading competitions, fostering increased engagement and liquidity on the platform.\n\nTrading Competitions:\n\nA series of trading competitions will be organized, with ARB tokens allocated as prizes. These competitions aim to attract traders, boost trading volume, and create a vibrant trading community on Rage Trade.\n\nUser Engagement and Performance Metrics:\nRage Trade has successfully cultivated a dynamic user base, boasting 70,000 active traders who regularly engage with our platform. This robust participation is a testament to our platform’s appeal and functionality within the trading community.\n\nIn addition to our active traders, we have nurtured a strong Liquidity Provider (LP) community, with 26,000 LPs contributing to our ecosystem. This substantial number of LPs underscores our platform’s reliability and the trust placed in us by those who provide liquidity, further cementing our role as a pivotal player in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our protocol’s historical performance not only demonstrates significant growth and adoption but also highlights our consistent delivery of value to our users, traders, and liquidity providers. These metrics are indicative of our integral position within the Arbitrum ecosystem and our potential to further enhance and expand our offerings with sustained support.\n\nRage’s Perpetual Performance:\n\nRage Trade v1 has experienced a remarkable market reception, evidenced by a staggering $735M in Total Trading Volume against Rage’s Total Value Locked (TVL). This impressive figure reflects the high demand and active engagement within our user base, showcasing the platform’s appeal and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n962×642 21.9 KB\nRage’s Vaults Performance:\n\nOur vault offerings, including the 80-20 Tricrypto Vault and GLP Vault, have achieved a notable peak TVL of approximately $19.87 million (at 100% max capacity since launch). This achievement highlights the trust and confidence users place in our vault products.\n\nAt its peak, Rage Trade accounted for about 1.4% of the entire Arbitrum TVL, marking our significant contribution to the overall ecosystem. This percentage represents our substantial impact and the value we add to the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThe 80-20 Tricrypto vault, in particular, has demonstrated exceptional performance. Over its 10-month lifespan, it outperformed holding GLP by 8%. Specifically, from July 2022 to April 2023, the 80-20 Tricrypto vault yielded a 44% return compared to a 36% return from merely holding GLP, showcasing its effectiveness and profitability.\n\nSteps to Implement: The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.\nTo implement this proposal, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring each phase contributes effectively to the overall goal. Here’s how we plan to proceed:\n\nData Reporting and Transparency: Rage Trade is committed to transparency and will implement Dune dashboards for real-time tracking of all relevant metrics. These dashboards will ensure community members have access to up-to-date data, reflecting our progress and adherence to the commitments outlined in this proposal. This approach emphasizes our dedication to transparency and accountability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIncentive Allocation: We will begin by using a portion of the ARB tokens for our gas rebate program to offset gas fees for our users. This will serve as the initial spark to ignite trading activities on the Rage Trade platform.\n\nFee Offset & Trading Competitions: We will then allocate the remaining tokens to incentivize trading, including trade competitions and offsetting fees implemented by integrated perp protocols. The trading competitions will be strategically scheduled over time to ensure ongoing participation and interest.\n\nRegular Updates and Reporting: Throughout the implementation, we will continuously monitor platform performance, trader engagement, and community feedback. This will allow us to make real-time adjustments and improvements where necessary. To maintain transparency, we will provide the community with regular updates and reports. These will include key performance metrics and insights gained from the implementation process.\n\nReview and Analysis: At the end of the implementation phase, we will conduct a thorough review. This will involve analyzing successes, identifying areas for improvement, and extracting key learnings for future initiatives.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to ensure not just the successful implementation of the proposal but also to contribute valuable insights for the continuous growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nTimeline: Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\nThe implementation of this proposal is structured into a 4-month period, with each month focusing on specific objectives and milestones:\n\nMonth 1 - Initiation and Setup (Immediately upon approval):\n\nAllocation of ARB tokens to the designated multisig wallet to immediately initiate gas rebates and trading fee offsets. Setup of the Dune dashboard for tracking key metrics such as trading volume and unique traders. Announcement of the initiative and upcoming trading competitions to the community.\n\nMonth 2 - Launch of Trading Competitions:\n\nOfficial launch of the first set of trading competitions.\n\nActive monitoring of trading activities and engagement levels.\n\nFirst monthly update provided to the community, highlighting early results and trader participation.\n\nMonth 3 - Mid-term Review and Adjustments:\n\nComprehensive review of the first two months, analyzing trader engagement and competition outcomes.\n\nAdjustments made to competitions and incentives based on feedback and data analysis.\n\nSecond monthly update provided, including insights and any changes implemented.\n\nMonth 4 - Final Push and Comprehensive Analysis:\n\nContinued incentivization and promotion of trading activities.\n\nFinal monthly update provided, leading up to the comprehensive quarterly report.\n\nPreparation of the detailed analysis report, evaluating the proposal’s success based on predefined objectives.\n\nPost-4-Month Period - Evaluation and Reporting:\n\nRelease of a comprehensive quarterly report, detailing the overall impact of the proposal on trading volume, trader engagement, and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Evaluation of the initiative’s success and consideration of potential future actions based on the outcomes.\n\nThis timeline ensures a structured approach to implementing the proposal, with regular updates and transparency. It allows for adjustments based on real-time data and community feedback, ensuring the initiative remains aligned with its goal of driving growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTo measure the success of achieving the grant objectives, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nDaily Volume: Aiming for a 30-day moving average of $10M in daily volume.\nDaily Traders: Targeting a 30-day moving average of 300 unique traders.\nIntegration: Committing to integrate 1 or more perpetual DEXes per 2 weeks (accounting for audit time).\nThese KPIs will serve as benchmarks to gauge our progress and effectiveness in utilizing the grant to drive growth and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nRage Trade aims to leverage the grant to attract a substantial influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, bolstering user interaction, transaction volume, TVL, and overall activity.\n\nStrategically, Rage Trade will allocate ~ 33% of the grant to gas rebates, with the other ~ 66% of the grant being directed towards offsetting integrated perp protocols’ trading fees and various trading competitions. The endgame is to amplify user onboarding and trading enthusiasm, resonating with genuine market dynamics.\n\nIt’s crucial to clarify that rebate rates will be determined by the genuine fees incurred by users. If our partnering protocols grant separate rebates or rewards, Rage Trade commits to ensuring that the total sum of rebates will never surpass the fees accrued. Throughout this promotional phase, trade-to-earn schemes will not be entertained. Additionally, the Rage Trade team will vigilantly deter and counteract wash trading and Sybil-attack incidents. Offending addresses linked with such activities will be publicly disclosed and denied the associated rebates.\n\nGas Rebates Explained:\nOnce a week, traders will receive ARB tokens as a gas rebate, mirroring the gas fees they’ve incurred throughout the week. This rebate system ensures that users can trade more freely, knowing a portion of their gas fees will be returned. The gas rebate will be uniformly applied across all protocols integrated with Rage Trade on Arbitrum, ensuring fairness and consistency for all traders. The rebate amount a trader receives will be directly proportional to the actual gas fees they’ve paid, eliminating any potential for manipulative practices like trade-to-earn schemes.\n\nFee Rebates Explained:\n\nARB tokens will be rewarded as fee rebates to our traders every Friday, reflecting the fees they’ve accumulated over the week.\n\nThis fee waiver will be consistently applied across all collaborating protocols.\n\nTraders’ rebate entitlements will strictly correlate with their actual trading fees, nullifying the chance for trade-to-earn practices. The rate of expenditure from the grant will be contingent on the volume of organic trading transpiring each week. The Rage Trade team pledges to continually identify and thwart wash trading and sybil-attack attempts.\n\nTo safeguard the integrity of the campaign, the specifics of the anti-wash-trading & anti-sybil-attack measures will be kept confidential and will be communicated post-event, mirroring best practices employed in protocol airdrop launches.\n\nExample of Fee Structure Post-Reduction:\n\nIf additional perps trading mechanisms in the Arbitrum realm are incorporated with Rage Trade amidst this campaign, the fee waiver will extend to those as well.\n\nIntegrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction\n\nGMX V1: 0.1% → 0%\n\nGMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%\n\nOverall Cost: The total cost to implement the AIP.\nThe total cost to implement this AIP for Rage Trade is 1.5M ARB tokens. This cost is solely dedicated to funding trading competitions and volume incentives on the Rage Trade platform. The breakdown is as follows:\n\nGas Rebates: 500k ARB tokens will be allocated for offsetting gas fees when trading perps on Arbitrum.\n\nTrading Fee Rebates & Competitions: The remaining 1m ARB will be used as trading fee offsets and trading competitions.\n\nThere are no additional costs involved in this proposal. The entire 1.5M ARB token request is focused on directly incentivizing users and enhancing their trading experience on Rage Trade.",

        "title": "Accelerating Arbitrum - leveraging Camelot as an ecosystem hub to support native builders",
        "author": "0x2e3BEf6830Ae84bb4225D318F9f61B6b88C147bF",
        "body": "**Non-Constitutional Proposal**\n\n**AUTHORS**\n[Iron Boots](https://twitter.com/SirBootsOfIron) (BD Lead), [Myrddin](https://twitter.com/0xmyrddin) (Dev Lead)\n\n...\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis post proposes granting 1.5M ARB per month to Camelot DAO for the next 6 months to fund liquidity incentives for Arbitrum-focused projects on Camelot, including the onboarding of new and multi-chain protocols entering the ecosystem. Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.\n\nOnce the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.\n\n...\n\n## Overall cost\n\n1,500,000 ARB distributed monthly over 6 months, for a total of 9M ARB tokens.",

        "body": "## **Abstract**\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal represents an improved version compared to previous initiatives and requests for comments (RFCs):\n\n- [[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-2-delegate-incentive-system-for-arbitrumdao/15720)\n- [[DRAFT] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/16501)\n\nWe have developed this new proposal considering the comments and observations provided by other delegates. Our additional motivation lies in the recent increase in proposals and increased activity within ArbitrumDAO. We believe that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes.\n\n# **Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## **Before reading the proposal, note how we have decided to structure it**\n\nThis proposal is structured into four main sections:\n\n* **Option 1:** This is our main proposal detailing all the specifications of the incentive system.\n* **Option 2:** Introduces the implementation of \"Karma\" to automate certain processes. It's important to note that this option entails additional costs.\n* **General Summary:** An overview of the proposed items.\n* **Next Steps:** Voting deadline\n\n# **Option 1 - Main Proposal**\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number at **50 delegates**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a reasonable starting point.\n\n## Funding\n\n- Incentives for delegates: 1,500,000 ARB\n- Incentive Program Administrator: 25,000 ARB\n\n## Delegate Selection Process\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\n> * So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\n> * The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\n> * Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:\n> 1. [Core Test Proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/60371879178081104082641012273221287927865067413661362234634146098631763379427)\n> 2.

[[OLD] AIP-1.1 - Lockup, Budget, Transparency ](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/79904733039853333959339953965823982558487956291458141923259498272549038367575)\n\n### Incentive Program Application\n\nDelegates matching the requirements must confirm their participation in the Incentive System in the forum (a dedicated channel will be established for this). They must post using the template provided below, within a 7-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\n> * Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid on a monthly basis, we will use a point system and a framework that will be made public.\n\n![scores.png](ipfs://bafybeieuu4yypwmkapdkznz4arvsci7t7ond4a7qh55us2fuz5ijjbhwsa)\n    \n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. This parameter is extracted from Tally. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR * 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Tn) /SV(Fn)) * 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Fn) - TV(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Fn) - CR(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Fn) - CP(Rn)) * 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 * TP% / 100))**\n\n#### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n- Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n- Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n- Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n- Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n- Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no? \n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Delegate Responsibilities\n\nDelegates are responsible for keeping track of their actions. At the end of the month, they have until the 3rd of the following month to submit a forum post with the following requirements:\n\n* A copy (Link) of the framework with their activity data for that month.\n* Additionally, the post must have a summary with all the links including:\n  * Snapshot voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the reasoning behind the snapshot vote\n  * Tally voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the tally vote reasoning (if you have changed your vote)\n  * Commenting on Proposals link (only those that went to snapshots)\n* The summary should also include:\n  * Delegate proposal links\n  * Links to any significant contribution (discussion, questions, suggestions, etc.) made to a proposal.\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Delegates failing to post the requested information will not receive incentives.\n> * To avoid forum spam and disarray, we will ask the facilitators to add a channel for the incentive system so delegates can input all their information there.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nAfter the delegates post and present their results in the framework, the incentive system administrator has 10 days to gather all the information, review, verify, and unify it. Then, present all the unified data on the forum in the [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862) and attach a summary explaining that month's final result.\n\nOnce the final result is presented, delegates have 2 days to file a claim in case of disagreement.\n\n#### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success. \n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be sent as a proposal to Tally, with full details of the payments, between the 16th and 17th. This will be repeated for the 6 months, so that the DAO has control over the incentive program and can cut it off whenever it wants.\n\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\nEstimated schedule:\n\n![schedule.png](ipfs://bafkreie7nlxyh7jx7myxgfj6eqogu6p7kfebmokq3v5fvxzskmmb7j2h64)\n    \n### Administrator Perspective\n\n1. Start of the month: Track delegate participation in governance.\n2. Last day of the month: Begin collecting delegate posts from the forum.\n3. Review all the information, check for accuracy, and compile it into the framework.\n4. Establish the results within the given timeframe.\n5. If everyone agrees, send a proposal to Tally with the payment details, to be voted on.\n6. Keep the DAO informed\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the adminstration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the adminstration of said program the budget would be 25,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator.\n\n---\n\n# **Option 2 - Karma automation for delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n**Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n- **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n- **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n- **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n- **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n- **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n- **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n### Cost\n\n- 30000 ARB\n\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nAs with Option 1, we are also open to having a group of delegates or potentially a third party administer Karma's progress and the program, in which case we would obviously provide all necessary assistance.\n\nFor the administration of the program for this option the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator. \n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\nProposal overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## CONT IN FORUM POST",

        "body": "## Constitutional / Non-Constitutional\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nTally has contributed to the Arbitrum DAO as a service provider since the DAO was created one year ago, serving as the home for [onchain governance](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum), [security council elections](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/council/security-council/election/0/round-2), and [delegation](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates). We’ve gathered feedback about how we can improve our support for Arbitrum through many conversations over the past year with DAO stakeholders including delegates, contributors, and Foundation representatives. We propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by researching specifications for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum is the largest and most decentralized DAO in the world. Tally is highly invested in the success of both the Arbitrum DAO specifically and the Arbitrum community as a whole. We have a strong track record as an Arbitrum governance service provider, [ecosystem builder](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tally-final-stip-round-1/17557), and [delegate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegate/0xfrisson.eth). Tally continuously ships improvements for the Arbitrum DAO, including [transfer actions](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1732425795262714363?s=20), [improved Safe support](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1714647532423561257?s=20), [proposal collaboration](https://x.com/tallyxyz/status/1743325532786168149?s=20), and the [nominee selection stage](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-changes-to-the-constitution-and-the-security-council-election-process/20856/9?u=frisson) of Security Council elections. This proposal would enable us to invest more resources into the Arbitrum DAO and scale up our impact.\n\nThe majority of the improvements outlined in this proposal are specific to Arbitrum's unique implementation of onchain governance and will not be re-used in other DAOs. We are long-term partners to the Arbitrum DAO who plan to continue investing specifically in making Arbitrum governance great. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThis proposal contributes to Arbitrum [Community Values](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution#section-6-community-values) by making the Arbitrum DAO more socially inclusive, technically inclusive, and user-focused. Our proposed improvements make it easier for contributors of all backgrounds and technical abilities to engage with Arbitrum governance.\n\n## Specifications and Steps to Implement\n\nWe propose to expand our support for the Arbitrum DAO by improving the proposal process, upgrading the Governor contracts, and highlighting delegate contributions. We also propose to ensure that the DAO is set up for success by developing a specification for partial delegation and shielded voting.\n\n**Improve the proposal process** \n*Watch a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yORl1yZPt7Q) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Link forum proposal posts and Tally proposals so that delegates can create Tally proposals from forum posts, see forum proposal comments directly on Tally, and be updated by a Tally Discourse bot when onchain proposals are created.\n  * In order to show posts on the proposal page, Tally would need [Embedding permission](https://meta.discourse.org/t/embed-discourse-comments-on-another-website-via-javascript/31963)\n  * In order to post \"this proposal is now onchain (link)\", the Tally Discourse bot would need an API key with topics.writepermission from https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/admin/api/keys/new\n* Build a diff checker into Tally proposals that shows what text has changed from Snapshot without having to click back over to Snapshot, to help delegates understand any relevant changes from the temp check phase to the onchain governance phase.\n* Enable cancel functionality on Tally proposals so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes. (see upgrade Governor contracts section)\n* Develop full proposal execution integration by dynamically showing [each phase of proposal execution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal#the-lifecycle-of-an-arbitrum-improvement-proposal) with accurate time stamps so that contributors and delegates can easily manage proposals through the execution process.\n* Improve support for [late quorum extension](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-glossary#late-quorum-extension) on Tally so onchain proposals are automatically extended on Tally when late quorum extension is triggered.\n* Fully integrate the [quorum of each Governor](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-faqs#what-determines-the-quorum-minimum-votes-required-for-a-governance-proposal) throughout Tally, including on the proposal page and the delegates page so that delegates always know exactly how much voting power is required to reach quorum.\n* Show [Security Council](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council#the-role-of-the-security-council) transactions on the main [Arbitrum DAO page](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) on Tally so the DAO can easily view actions taken by the Security Council.\n\n**Upgrade Governor contracts**\n*We’re planning to partner with [Scopelift](https://scopelift.co/) to implement the upgrades. Scopelift is the developer of Flexible Voting and has deep experience with high-value governance contract upgrades.*\n\n* Add a [cancel() function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/92ff025622cdf6694318fc11af1c995236793a77/contracts/governance/Governor.sol#L455-L473) to the Arbitrum DAO’s implementation of OpenZeppelin Governor so proposal creators can cancel onchain proposals if there are mistakes.\n* Add [Flexible Voting](https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting) to the Arbitrum DAO Governors to enable future innovations like voting from Orbit chains, voting from DeFi contracts, and shielded voting.\n\n**Highlight delegate contributions**\n*Watch a demo video [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WY1jQ2tP70U) - note that this demo is designed to provide a general overview of the user experience. It is not a final design.*\n\n* Integrate [Karma’s](https://www.karmahq.xyz/) delegate score and contributor metrics into Tally’s delegate page so token holders and DAO stakeholders have access to holistic participation information. Karma will provide the following via their API:\n  * Onchain and Snapshot voting pct, delegator count, voting power, list of delegators\n  * Stats for different timeframes: Lifetime, last 30 days, last 90 days etc\n  * Various sorting criteria (score, voting power, voting pct, forum activity)\n  * Onchain endorsements by peer delegates\n  * Updates to the scoring logic if needed (Based on community feedback)\n  * Software maintenance and keeping data updated on daily basis\n\n**Research to set the DAO up for long-term success**\n\n* Research a partial delegation solution so that token holders can delegate to more than one address.\n* Research a solution for shielded onchain voting so that large delegate voting does not influence other voters during the voting or election period. Ensure that this solution applies to Security Council elections.\n\n## Timeline\n\nResearch and Design: 0.5 months\n\nDevelopment: 2 months\n\nTesting, audit, and deployment (includes DAO proposal): 2 months\n\n**Total:** 4.5 months\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nImprove the proposal process: $120,000 USD in ARB\n\nUpgrade Governor contracts: $50,000 USD in ARB (100% will go to Scopelift)\n\nHighlight delegate contributions: $40,000 USD in ARB\n\n* Tally: $20,000 USD in ARB\n* Karma: $20,000 USD in ARB\n\nResearch to set the DAO up for long-term success: $10,000 USD in ARB\n\n**Total:** $220,000 USD in ARB\n\n*special thanks to the DAO Ops Excellence team at GovHack who helped moved this proposal forward @shawn16400 @hiringdevs.eth @hung-vu @cbxm*",

        "body": "Non-Constitutional\n\nAbstract\nTLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",

    "ai_final_reason": "- The proposal has strong timeline support with a dominant 'For' lead ratio and stability metrics indicating clear community preference.\n- Forum sentiment is mixed but leans positive overall with 15 positive, 18 negative, and 19 neutral comments; early comments emphasize the proposal's transparency and data-driven decision benefits.\n- Historical adjacent proposals focused on Orbit chain expansion and DAO funding have shown price and TVL declines post-vote, highlighting the need for better metrics and transparency, which this proposal addresses.\n- Market impacts show negative price and TVL changes, but these are common in DAO proposals and do not outweigh the long-term benefits of improved transparency and governance.\n- While some concerns about cost and scalability exist, these are mitigated by the team's plan for automation and the proposed KPI threshold for chain inclusion.\n- The recommendation aligns with the forum sentiment majority and supports the DAO’s durable benefit by enabling informed decisions and ecosystem growth.",
