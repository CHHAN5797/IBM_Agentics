        "body": "## Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract / Motivation\n\nCurrently, the DAO receives transaction fees on Nova at an address accessible via the core governance system. This means that any time the DAO wishes to transfer these funds, it must pass a [constitutional proposal](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal). We propose instead a system in which these funds are “automatically” (permissionlessly) sent from Nova to the Arbitrum DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One. This gives the DAO faster, easier accessibility to these funds, and should make bookkeeping simpler.\n\n## Details\n\nCurrently, the [portion of the Nova transaction fees](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/fee-distribution) that the DAO collects are sent via the [fund distributor contracts](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts) to [0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7951D92B0C345144506576eC13Ecf5103aC905a), the [address alias](https://docs.arbitrum.io/arbos/l1-to-l2-messaging#address-aliasing) of the core governance l1 timelock. This allows the DAO to spend the funds via a [round-trip core proposal](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/lifecycle-anatomy-aip-proposal) initiated from the core governor on Arbitrum One.\n\nA system in which these funds were sent to the DAO Treasury without the DAO needing to take action is preferable for several reasons:\n\n- Spending from the DAO treasury requires a lower quorum (3% vs. 5%)\n- Spending from the DAO treasury is faster (doesn’t impose the additional ~ 2 weeks of delay\n- Keeping all fees in a single location makes bookkeeping simpler and easier to reason about.\n\nWe propose an update in which all Nova fund distributors that distribute to the timelock alias are updated to instead distribute to a system of “fee routers”, via which permissionless transactions will allow the funds to be routed to the Arbitrum Treasury.\n\nThe lifecycle works as follows:\n\n1. A distributeRewards is called on a RewardDistributor contract, sending funds to a ChildToParentRouter contract.\n2. Either upon receiving funds or via a call to routeFunds, the ChildToParentRouter creates an L2-to-L1 message which sends the contract’s full Ether balance.\n3. The L2-to-L1 message is executed, transferring the Ether to a ParentToChildRouter contract on L1.\n4. routeFunds is called on ParentToChildRouter, creating a retryable ticket which transfers its full Ether balance to the DAO Treasury on Arbitrum One.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- Fee Router contracts:\n  - Github link: [fund-distribution-contracts/src/FeeRouter at 61f4f60384e2ecba8250287dfb2778ce30bd82b0 · OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/tree/61f4f60384e2ecba8250287dfb2778ce30bd82b0/src/FeeRouter)\n  - Deployments:\n    - [ParentToChildRewardRouter | Address 0x3EB1F638C115F7dE148FAE18b8217e6c200c8657 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3EB1F638C115F7dE148FAE18b8217e6c200c8657)\n    - [ChildToParentRewardRouter | Address 0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4 | Arbiscan](https://nova.arbiscan.io/address/0x47a85c0a118127f3968a6a1a61e2a326517540d4) \n  - Audit Link: [fund-distribution-contracts/audits at cb9ef7b5a5730fb9eb4bfdd2f9bc1f716a6e9253 · OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts · GitHub](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/fund-distribution-contracts/tree/cb9ef7b5a5730fb9eb4bfdd2f9bc1f716a6e9253/audits)\n - Upgrade Action contract:\n   - [ArbOS30 AIP: add AIPNovaFeeRoutingAction by DZGoldman · Pull Request #230 · ArbitrumFoundation/governance · GitHub](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/230)\n\n## Additional Action\n\nSometime after this proposal action, an additional proposal can be submitted to transfer the funds remaining in the timelock’s address alias to the fee router.\n\n## Timeline\n\nIf this vote passes on Snapshot, the tentative plan is to upgrade Arbitrum Sepolia to ArbOS 30 the week of June 10th.\n\nIf Arbitrum Sepolia upgrades to ArbOS 30, there will be an ecosystem-wide plan to ensure non-breaking compatibility of infrastructure and applications with Stylus, which will take several weeks or months. The ultimate goal is that the experience for EVM developers remains as unchanged as possible if ArbOS reaches mainnet. Once enough confidence is reached, there will be an onchain vote to upgrade Arbitrum One and Nova to ArbOS 30. The Arbitrum community will be informed of any significant updates as they arise.",

        "body": "# Abstract\nThe ArbitrumDAO has on-chain governance via a suite of smart contracts. It allows the ArbitrumDAO to spend funds from its treasury alongside upgrading any smart contract that governs Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova. The on-chain smart contract suite includes a voting protocol alongside a series of contracts that will forward the proposal’s intended action to the correct destination before executing it.\n\nThis proposal focuses on extending the time delay between when the voting protocol has concluded and the time it takes for the successful proposal to be passed along by the system until it is in the right destination to be executed. The focus is on the **L2 Core Time Lock** contract that lives on Arbitrum One and proposes changing the delay from 3 days to 8 days which effectively increases the delay by an additional 5 days. Accordingly, the change only applies to constitutional proposals which require upgrades to smart contracts.\n\nThere are two benefits to increasing the delay:\n\n- **Security Council.** The Security Council will have more time to act if a malicious proposal is passed by the ArbitrumDAO for whatever reason.\n- **Exit window.** Users will have more time to withdraw their assets from Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova if they are worried or not satisfied with how a proposal intends to change the smart contracts that govern Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Nova.\n\nAdditionally, by increasing the exit window, it will also update the status of Arbitrum by L2Beat and replace a red slice with a yellow slice. This will help Arbitrum move one step closer towards a Stage-2 rollup.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-29 at 1.26.16 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiehq4k64tgt6r3tsvdiwojng4a2olhhcxtvpzut6pkrm3nycmb7a4)\n*Image: If this proposal passes, it would change Arbitrum ‘Exit Window’ slice from Red to Yellow, according to [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/arbitrum)*\n    \nThe downside of increasing the delay is that all constitutional proposals, primarily for upgrading the smart contracts, will be delayed by 5 days. It does not impact nor add an additional delay to any spending from the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury including ARB and ETH.\n\n# Time Lock Extension\n\n \n![7804eaf2447a80a7fe71b0255dc311c185c464de_2_1248x632.png](ipfs://bafkreidknqyjhte55xyuixzszebvlo3eejhijhebq7vsg3w5azlvspekcq)\n*Image: Overview of the Current Time Locks*\n    \n\nAll proposals voted on and passed by the ArbitrumDAO must pass through an L2 Time Lock before it can move onto the next stage.\n\nThere are currently two L2 Time Locks that are implemented via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\n\n- **L2 Treasury TimeLock.** Delays all spends from the ArbitrumDAO’s ETH Treasury.\n- **L2 Core TimeLock.** Delays any actions related to on-chain upgrades.\n\nThe proposal focuses on the **Core L2 TimeLock**. It is responsible for passing messages that contain executable code and it has the authority to upgrade any smart contract in the system including on-chain governance and the bridges (holding user assets) on Arbitrum One/Nova.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the governance of smart contracts, please check out this [diagram](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/roundtrip-governance.png?raw=true) and the [docs](https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/blob/main/docs/overview.md).\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal is to change the value of _minDelay from 259200 (seconds) to 691200 (seconds) in the [L2 Timelock](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x34d45e99f7D8c45ed05B5cA72D54bbD1fb3F98f0#readProxyContract) contract. This will change the time delay from 3 days to 8 days, an additional 5 days.\n\nThe action contract is implemented and still pending an audit: https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/governance/pull/306\n\nAdditionally, we will need to update the following ArbitrumDAO Constitution text:\n\n*Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, a 3 day waiting period occurs. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n\nPhase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the 3 day waiting period in Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.*\n\nThe Constitution Text will be updated to the following:\n\n*Phase 4: L2 Waiting Period (3 or 8 days): After an AIP has passed Phase 3, there is a 3 day waiting period for actions related to the DAO Treasury and an 8 day waiting period for an L2-to-L1 Message. This gives users who object to the AIP time to initiate withdrawal of their funds or take other action on L2.\n\nPhase 5: Initiate and Finalize an L2-to-L1 Message (at least 1 challenge period of the rollup protocol): After the waiting period for Phase 4 has passed, an L2-to-L1 message is sent indicating that the AIP was passed.*\n\nThe new constitution hash: 0x28faf2acba9b3ff80ec484e3d5646931eeef40568b1b7c38dbe52b890bfd7938\n\n# Timeline\n\n- **Feedback Period:** 23/8/24 to 29/8/24\n- **Temperature Check:** 29/8/24 to 5/9/24\n- **ARDC Review:** 5/9/24 to 16/9/24\n- **On-chain vote:** 16/9/24\n\nThere is no cost to the ArbitrumDAO for the implementation of this proposal and an audit will be publicly available prior to the on-chain vote.",

        "body": "## Non-Constitutional Proposal\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is seeking 4,234 ETH, for **Assertion and challenge bonds** - to allow the Arbitrum Foundation to run a BoLD validator and fulfill the role of being the first, but not necessarily the only, honest and active proposer.\n\nThis proposal is contingent on the AIP [upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) being approved by the ArbitrumDAO. If the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD does not pass - then the Arbitrum Foundation will return these funds, to the ArbitrumDAO within 30 days.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD only proposes the technical upgrade and intentionally does not yet introduce an economic incentive mechanism to grow the validator set (since Arbitrum only needs 1 honest, active proposer at any point in time). Without this incentive, the ArbitrumDAO holds the risk that no entity will fulfill the role of being the first honest party to secure Arbitrum One. By adopting this proposal, the ArbitrumDAO is appointing the Arbitrum Foundation to be the first active proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\n## Key Terms\n\n- **Active proposer**. A proposer who is actively posting assertions and helping advance the chain. Validators are not considered active proposers until they successfully propose an assertion with a bond. In order to become an active proposer for Arbitrum One, post-BoLD, a validator has to propose an L2 state assertion to Ethereum. If they do not have an active bond on L1, they then need to attach a bond to their assertion in order to successfully post the assertion. Subsequent assertions posted by the same address will simply move the already-supplied bond to their latest proposed assertion. Meanwhile, if an entity, say Bob, has posted a successor assertion to one previously made by another entity, Alice, then Bob would be considered by the protocol to be the current active proposer. Alice would no longer be considered by the protocol as the active proposer and once Alice’s assertion is confirmed, then Alice gets her assertion bond refunded. There can only be 1 “active” proposer at any point.\n- **Assertion**. A claim posted to the Arbitrum rollup contracts on Ethereum L1 about the Arbitrum L2 execution state. Each claim consumes messages from the Arbitrum rollup inbox contract that are ordered by the Sequencer.\n- **Assertion bond**. Creating an assertion in the rollup contracts requires the proposer to join the validator set by putting up a bond, in the form of 3,600 ETH. Subsequent assertions posted by the same party do not require more bonds, instead, the protocol always considers validators to be bonded to their latest posted assertion until they withdraw.\n- **Challenge bond**. The challenge process in BoLD requires a proposer to post a bond whenever they want to challenge a malicious (and invalid) assertion from a dishonest proposer. This applies to the block level, big-step sub-challenge, and one-step sub-challenge levels, as part of the interactive dispute game played between challengers.\n- **One honest party**. In BoLD, a single, honest party can protect the integrity and liveness of the system. While only a single party is required to act, it is still an open and permissionless system, allowing anyone to step up at any time.\n- **Proposer**. An agent who looks up the list of ordered transactions, executes them off-chain, and then proposes a claim on the final execution output by posting an assertion on-chain. A proposer *must* have a bond deposited into the BoLD rollup contracts on Ethereum to be considered eligible, by the protocol, to post assertions.\n- **Service fee**. A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. The fee is paid for every on-chain assertion posted by the proposer once their assertion is confirmed. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Assertion and Challenge Bonds\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO treasury to cover the bonds required to establish a single honest proposer with the capability to defend the system.\n\nThe requested ETH is a combination of:\n- 3600 ETH required to post an assertion bond, and;\n- Subsequent 555 ETH + 79 ETH for challenge bonds for one challenge.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation will deposit these funds in the [RollupCore.sol] contracts on L1 Ethereum for the validator. If the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) passes, then the Arbitrum Foundation’s staked validator will be enabled to immediately act as a proposer for Arbitrum One.\n\nNote: the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to be the first active proposer, not the ONLY proposer. BoLD removes the reliance on a permissioned set of validators who are eligible to be proposers, and any interested parties and/or teams can permissionlessly run validators to become proposers for Arbitrum One upon a successful upgrade of the dispute protocol.\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until there is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 4,234 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 3600 ETH to run the first BoLD-enabled proposer for Arbitrum One, and\n- 634 (555 + 79) ETH budget to counter one BoLD challenge.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**. The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).",

A fee for proposers who are actively and successfully posting on-chain assertions which should amount to the same income that Ethereum validators receive over the same time period. This fee removes the disincentive to lock up capital and be a proposer for the protocol and should not be viewed as an incentive or reward.\n\n## Budget Request\n\n### Service Fees for BoLD Validators\n\nAll blockchains, including Arbitrum One, should compensate participants who actively work to progress the chain.\n\nFor Arbitrum One, the [BoLD AIP](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232) proposes that the DAO pay a service fee to an active proposer who is advancing the chain by posting assertions. If approved, the service fee will correlate to the same annualized income earned by a validator on Ethereum mainnet, which at the time of writing is approximately 3% to 4% of the staked ETH per year ([Composite Ether Staking Rate benchmark by CoinDesk Indices](https://www.coindesk.com/indices/ether/cesr)). \n\nNOTE: This payment is a fee and not a reward. In both the currently deployed protocol and in BoLD, a new assertion is posted every hour and only the time that the proposer is considered actively bonded will be used to determine the fee amount. Additionally, proposers are only eligible for this fee when their assertion is confirmed. There can be multiple actors who deposit the required assertion bond and run a proposer, but the fee will only be paid to the proposer whose assertion is the first to be accepted on L1 (i.e. active).\n\nWe estimate the following service fee per year:\n- Assuming a 4% service fee based on the 3600 ETH bond size, equates to a maximum of 144 ETH per year per active proposer (at this assumed rate).\n\nThe Foundation therefore requests 500 ETH to support service fee payments for up to 3 years (144*3 years plus a buffer of 68 ETH) in the event that an active proposer, who is not the Arbitrum Foundation, steps up to advance the chain. \n\nTo learn more about service fees, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-bold-permissionless-validation-for-arbitrum/23232#service-fee-for-active-proposers-7).\n\nNote: The Arbitrum Foundation will NOT be entitled to receive the service fee since the Arbitrum Foundation is proposing to use the ArbitrumDAO’s funds.\n\n### Reimbursement of L1 Gas Costs\n\nThe Foundation is requesting 400 ETH to reimburse the on-chain gas costs for active (and honest) proposers who are helping advance and defend the Arbitrum chain. It is estimated that 400 ETH will be sufficient to cover ~3 years of operational costs.\n\nThere are two on-chain gas costs:\n- **Posting assertions**. An active proposer must post an assertion for the chain to advance.\n- **Challenges**. A proposer who is defending the system must participate in a multi-round challenge process.\n\nNote: we only propose to reimburse L1 gas costs since that is publicly verifiable and computable by all. The off-chain costs to run a proposer will not be reimbursed.\n\n#### Estimated Reimbursement Costs\n\nAssuming a nominal gas price of 50 gwei/gas during normal operations (i.e. no challenges) and assuming an elevated 500 gwei/gas price during a challenge (i.e. worst-case scenario), to fully reimburse an honest party’s gas costs the Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 400 ETH for 3 years.\n\nThis includes ~308 ETH to cover the above costs and a ~92 ETH buffer in the event of higher gas prices during normal operations, during a challenge, and/or in the event that there is more than one challenge per year.\n\nTo learn more about these calculations, check out the [forum post](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-funds-to-bootstrap-the-first-bold-validator/24506#reimbursement-of-l1-gas-costs-7).\n\n## Steps to implement & timeline\n\n1. Publication of an AIP to the ArbitrumDAO forums for engaged discussion and debate.\n2. Two separate temperature checks on Snapshot.\n  a. Bond sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the Arbitrum Foundation’s request for 4234 ETH to run the first BoLD validator.\n  b. Operational cost sentiment. Test whether the ArbitrumDAO may approve the additional service fee for active proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation) and the reimbursement of L1 gas costs for running an active proposer, totalling 900 ETH.\n3. Depending on the temperature check result:\n  a. Continue to Tally. If there is strong consensus on both temperature checks, then the AIP will be published as one on-chain AIP on Tally for an on-chain vote.\n  b. Re-iterate on numbers. If either temperature check is rejected by the DAO, then it will be iterated on and re-submitted for a temperature check again, until these is consensus.\n4. Assuming a successful vote on-chain, the funds will be transferred to a multi-sig wallet controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n5. The Arbitrum Foundation will then deposit the funds in a validator that will be used to secure Arbitrum One, if the AIP to upgrade the DAO-governed chains to use BoLD is passed.\n\n## Payment facilitation, final costs & restrictions\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is requesting 900 ETH from the ArbitrumDAO to cover the following costs:\n- 500 ETH as service fees for active BoLD proposers (excluding the Arbitrum Foundation), and,\n- 400 ETH to reimburse honest parties on their L1 gas costs for 3 years.\n\nNotable points:\n- Arbitrum Foundation will not be entitled to the service fee,\n- Arbitrum Foundation will be reimbursed for the L1 gas costs,\n- All service fee payments and L1 gas reimbursements for non-Arbitrum Foundation actors will be manually processed by the Arbitrum Foundation periodically alongside a requirement that all payments adhere to the Foundation’s compliance process.\n\nAll requested funds will be sent to a multi-sig controlled by the Arbitrum Foundation and the funds will be returned if the BoLD proposal is not approved by the ArbitrumDAO. Additionally, after 3 years, any unspent funds from the service fee or gas reimbursements will be returned to the ArbitrumDAO and a subsequent proposal will be posted to help cover the future operational costs of Arbitrum.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the authority to single-handedly return the funds to the ArbitrumDAO treasury by revoking the Arbitrum Foundation’s proposer at any time and returning the bonds back to the treasury. This will be implemented and enforced via the BoLD smart contracts:\n- **Withdrawal Address**. The funds will be deposited into BoLD from the Arbitrum Foundation-controlled multi-sig address but the withdrawal address will be set to the ‘UpgradeExecutor’ contract on L1.\n- **Triggering Withdrawal**. The ArbitrumDAO (via governance) or the Arbitrum Foundation will have the authority to trigger a withdrawal and the funds can only be sent to the pre-established withdrawal address (i.e. the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury).",

    "summary": "This proposal combines the adoption of Timeboost, a new transaction ordering policy to capture MEV revenue for the DAO, with a Nova Fee Sweep to transfer 1,885 ETH of historical Nova fees to the DAO Treasury. The proposal is broadly supported by the community and expert delegates, with strong positive sentiment in the governance forum and high voter turnout in favor.",
    "key_arguments_for": [
      "Timeboost offers a sustainable revenue source for the ArbitrumDAO without harming regular users by capturing MEV profits currently lost to searchers.",
      "The Nova Fee Sweep transfers idle historical Nova fees to the DAO Treasury, improving treasury efficiency and enabling better funding for DAO operations.",
      "The proposal has undergone extensive vetting, including an independent audit of Timeboost contracts and successful temperature check votes indicating strong community support.",
      "Governance retains control over auction parameters and can disable Timeboost if needed, with monitoring planned to track impacts on the ecosystem."
    ],
    "key_arguments_against": [
      "Concerns exist about potential increased transaction latency for non-express lane users due to a nominal 200ms delay, possibly affecting user experience.",
      "Risk of monopolization of the express lane by a single bidder, potentially disadvantaging other traders and protocols.",
      "Uncertainty around how the additional revenue will be used by the DAO and lack of redistribution to protocols potentially impacted by the new ordering policy.",
      "Some community members prefer separating unrelated proposals to avoid conflating distinct impacts and simplify governance."
