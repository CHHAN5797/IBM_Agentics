The goal of Catapulta is to perform production and testnet Aave V3 instance deployments in EVM networks, approved by the Aave DAO.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe founder of Catapulta, David Racero, worked previously as Solidity Developer in Aave Companies during 2 years and a half, and was the main responsible for deployments scripting of Aave V2 and Aave V3 during the whole time at the company. \n\nCatapulta has created a smart contracts deployments platform that aims to automate certain manual workflows during deployments, like deployments reports, broadcasting txs and verifications in block explorers, allowing to speed up Web3 development cycles.\n\n### Specification\n\nCatapulta, as a potential Development Service Provider to the Aave DAO, will be focusing on the following scope of actions:\n\n- Perform the deployment of new Aave V3 instances in EVM networks, in testnet and production, approved by the Aave DAO via Snapshot.\n- Develop activation proposals for the Aave DAO to initialize Aave V3 instances, following all security procedures.\n- Maintenance of Aave V3 deployment scripting to support new EVM networks.\n\nThe production deployment services will only happen once a positive [technical evaluation](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-deployments-technical-evaluation-framework-of-a-network/10237) AND snapshot approval from the Aave DAO.\n\nCatapulta will reject any Aave V3 deployments requests from competitors or forks, and will pursue full transparency during the duration of the services. Catapulta will be in touch with all parties involved during the onboarding of a new Aave V3 instance, ex risk contributors, growth, development and security service providers.\n\n### Duration & Proposed Budget\n\nThe duration for this service proposal will be 6 months.\n\nDue the nature of the proposed services, that will only happen once a positive technical evaluation AND approval from the Aave DAO Governance, Catapulta has opted for a flat fee per production deployment.\n\n- Fixed $15.000 USD in GHO or USDC, plus gas reimbursement, per Aave V3 production deployment, paid at the activation proposal.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Catapulta website](https://catapulta.sh/)\n\n**[BGD.

The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Catapulta and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Catapulta.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Integrate Oval for the BAL & SNX Ethereum V3 Markets \nAuthor: UMA\nDate: 2024-01-31\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to integrate Oval developed by UMA into the BAL and SNX Ethereum V3 markets. This **pilot program** will enable Aave DAO to capture MEV associated with oracle updates from liquidations that occur in the BAL & SNX markets. This proposal is purposefully small in its initial scope, targeting only two isolated pools (BAL & SNX), to allow Aave to experiment with MEV capture with a bounded, low-risk pilot.\n\n### Motivation\n\nAave incentivizes third parties to liquidate Aave debt positions that have become distressed through a liquidation bonus. These liquidations generate enough profit that searchers compete to send their liquidating transactions immediately after the Chainlink price feed update. The MEV from Aave liquidations has benefitted searchers, block builders and validators, but not Aave protocol, which could have generated up to **$62.2MM** (Jan 2021 to Jan 2024) via Oval.\n\nOval allows Aave to capture the majority of this MEV as revenue. Oval is a MEV capture tool for [Oracle Extractable Value](https://docs.oval.xyz/oval-overview/problem) built on Chainlink Data Feeds and Flashbot’s [MEV-Share](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/mev-share) infrastructure. Oval requires no smart contract code changes to integrate.\n\n### Specification\nOval enables OEV capture by wrapping Chainlink price updates as they are pushed onchain so that OEV cannot be extracted without the consent of the protocol.\n\nWith Oval, when searchers perform a liquidation on Aave an order flow auction is triggered using Flashbots’ MEV Share—a trusted tool that allows MEV searchers to compete for MEV extraction offchain.\n\nTo extract the OEV created by an update, searchers must submit a winning bid, most of which is paid to the protocol as revenue. The winner of the auction gets the right to backrun the oracle update transaction—performing the liquidation by adding their transaction to the block immediately after the price update.\n\nIf no bid is received by the end of the auction window, the Chainlink price is automatically released and Aave liquidations function as normal.\n\nDeploying Oval requires two simple steps:\n\n- Deploy Aave’s own instance of the Oval smart contracts for the BAL and SNX markets (UMA is happy to assist with this).\n- Update the BAL and SNX market’s oracle address from the Chainlink price feed to the Oval smart contract that points to the same Chainlink price feed.\nThese steps are further detailed in our docs 4. UMA is committed to providing ongoing support to ensure a successful implementation of Oval.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n- [Aave Liquidations](https://docs.aave.com/faq/liquidations)\n- [Oval documentation](https://docs.oval.xyz/)\n- [Flashbots MEV-Share](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/mev-share)\n- [Aave OEV Dashboard](https://dune.com/risk_labs/aave-oev-via-liquidation-bonuses)\n- [Oval Launch Post](https://medium.com/uma-project/announcing-oval-earn-protocol-revenue-by-capturing-oracle-mev-877192c51fe2)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with UMA Team and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 470 Mn+ (~168k Eth) TVL\n- 18K restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH and sfrxETH and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >12 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $4 Mn\n    - [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-67/deposit) - $4 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x64939a882c7d1b096241678b7a3a57ed19445485) - $3.2 Mn\n    - [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x1b06f8fc94b95b6a8075aa1dcf12e69c70144c52?chain=1) - $0.9 Mn\n- $3.5 Mn average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 17th Feb)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nExchange rate is calculated basis the formula:\n\nrseth / eth = [(asset amount in protocol * asset price in ETH)rsETH total supply]\n\nrsEth relies on multiple contract exchange rates for:\n\n1. stEth: As this is a rebasing token, the balance of stETH changes over time and the asset price is taken as 1stETH = 1 ETH.\n\n2. ETHx: Asset price is taken from getExchangeRate( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf5EA1b38380f6aF39068375516Daf40Ed70D299#readProxyContract\n\n3. Sfrxeth: Asset price is taken from pricePerShare( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/token/0xac3e018457b222d93114458476f3e3416abbe38f\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nAs of today, the only way to exit rsETH is via DEXs. KelpDAO is going to enable withdrawals by mid-March 2024 after which users can withdraw Eth or any LSTs via KelpDAO dapp.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n- Contract Address: [0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n- [Github Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
