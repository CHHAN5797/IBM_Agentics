These points determine the weekly distribution of StkAAVE and GHO rewards. The precise calculations are kept private to prevent gaming of the system. Merit does not provide any benefits to Sybil's actions.\n\n### Rewarded Actions\n\nActions that align with Aave's strategic objectives will be rewarded:\n\n| Action |\n| --- |\n| Deposit LST, Borrow wETH |\n| Deposit LSTs, Borrow wETH using emode |\n| Deposit sDAI, Borrow GHO |\n| Deposit USDC/USDT, Borrow GHO |\n| Deposit AAVE, Borrow GHO |\n\n### Merit boosters\n\nMerit boosters enhance these rewards for specific behaviors:\n\n| Behavior | Multiplier description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Staker | Bonus for staking AAVE, StkBPT, StkGHO |\n| Active in Governance | Rewards for voting or delegating to an Aave DAO recognized delegate platform |\n| First-degree User | Bonus for direct Aave protocol users |\n| Second-degree user of aligned protocol | booster for users coming from aligned protocols that favor Aave over other protocols. |\n| Migrator | Incentive for moving positions to Aave from others protocols |\n| Diversity Supporter | Rewards for using minority LSTs |\n| OG DAO Participant | Booster for early DAO voters or delegates |\n| Holdooor | Booster for ≥100-day AAVE holders in the past year |\n| Stakoor | Booster for ≥100-day StkAAVE holders in the past year |\n\n### Merit Diluters\n\nMerit Diluters will dilute part or all rewards for certain behaviors:\n\n| Behavior | Penalty Description/Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| User of Non-Aligned Protocol | Severe dilution (up to -100%) |\n| Dumpoor Sold threshold amount of the previous week's airdrop | dilution |\n| Freerider Has not voted or delegated to a recognized Aave DAO delegate Platform | Light dilution |\n\n \n![aave merit.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeid6rig6onva3t4eaunfqhd66zaajlxgy6tfncf3ocsnq4fmd2flpy)\n    \n\n- **User A**: This user regularly engages in actions rewarded by \"Merit.\" As a direct participant in the Aave protocol, User A can expect to receive slightly higher rewards compared to users with indirect involvement.\n- **User B**: This user is highly active within the Aave ecosystem. By staking in the Safety Module and actively participating in governance (voting or delegating), User B is eligible for enhanced rewards through the \"Merit\" system.\n- **User C**: This user operates through non-aligned protocols, As a result, User C will not receive any periodic rewards from the \"Merit\" system.\n\n### Budget, Duration Scope\n\n- **Weekly Budget:** Defined by Aave Finance service providers at ARFC stage.\n- **Duration:** Initial 90-day period.\n- **Scope**: Aave V3 Ethereum\n\n### Non-aligned protocol list:\n\nWe propose to launch Merit with a single protocol with non-aligned status: Morpho Aave Optimizers V2 & V3\n\n### Migration bonus multipliers list:\n\nWe propose to apply the “migrator” Boosters to users of the following protocols:\n\n- Morpho V2\n- Morpho V3\n- Morpho Blue\n- Spark\n\n### Start of the snapshot to calculate Merit rewards:\n\nTimestamp equivalent block of the publication of this TEMP CHECK with retroactive rewards at the time of implementation of this proposal in case of a successful AIP vote.\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Refine the proposal details based on community feedback to achieve consensus.\n2. Conduct a TEMP CHECK snapshot vote.\n3. If successful, escalate to the ARFC stage, followed by an ARFC snapshot vote.\n4. Upon successful ARFC outcome, prepare and submit an AIP for implementation.\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes \"Merit,\" without external compensation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

After technical preparations and consultations, the following parameter adjustments options are proposed:\n\n**Option A**\n\n| Parameter | Current Parameters | Proposed Parameters |\n|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| Cooldown  | 10 Days            | 15 Days             |\n| Budget    | 30 AAVE/day        | 100 AAVE/day        |\n\n**Option B**\n\n| Parameter | Current Parameters | Proposed Parameters |\n|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| Cooldown  | 10 Days            | 20 Days             |\n| Budget    | 30 AAVE/day        | 50 AAVE/day        |\n\n\nThe proposed changes are intended to optimize the effectiveness of StkGHO in its role within the Safety Module.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Conduct a snapshot vote to confirm the community's agreement with the proposed changes.\n3. Implement the parameter updates in accordance with the snapshot results.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated for creating this proposal and is acting independently on behalf of the Aave community's best interests.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n---",

While they were initially eligible and considered for the Orbit program, they opted to explore the possibility of becoming a service provider to the DAO. However, given their recent decision to re-organize internally and re-evaluate their proposed scope as a service provider, it's appropriate to reconsider their inclusion in the Orbit program.\n\n## Specification\n\n### TokenLogic Inclusion\n\n- TokenLogic will be recognized as an official delegate within the Orbit program for a period of 90 days.\n- They will receive a monthly compensation of 5k GHO, totaling 15k GHO over the three-month period.\n\n### Funding and Emissions\n\nTokenLogic's compensation will be in line with the Orbit program's guidelines, ensuring fairness and consistency with other delegates.\n\n### Responsibilities and Conditions\n\n- TokenLogic will actively participate in Aave governance, representing their delegators and contributing to the protocol's growth.\n- If TokenLogic presents and successfully passes a proposal to become a service provider to the DAO, their Orbit funding stream will be terminated to prevent double compensation.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The inclusion of TokenLogic is based on their merits and contributions to the Aave community.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Compensating them with GHO and ETH reimbursement of Gas costs associated with their governance activity.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the transition to Governance V3, a significant feature introduced is gasless voting via Gelato integration on the [DAO-run governance app](https://vote.onaave.com), making it easier for delegates to participate without the burden of gas costs.\n\nThis innovation prompts the proposal to discontinue the general gas rebate program, However, recognizing the continued necessity for proposal creation and payload deployment activities, the proposal suggests maintaining targeted gas rebates for these specific actions. These tasks are now streamlined under the ACI's Dolce Vita product, offering a focused and efficient mechanism to manage and reimburse the gas expenditures associated with governance contributions.\n\nTo accurately track and reimburse gas expenditures, the proposal leverages [open-source scripts](https://github.com/JosepBove/aave-gov-gas) initially developed by Josep Bove, now part of the ACI team. These scripts have been [adapted for compatibility with Governance V3](https://github.com/AaveChan/aave-gov3-gas/tree/master), ensuring transparency and accountability in monitoring gas costs incurred by delegates during their governance activities.\n\nMoreover, the proposal introduces the [Orbit Tracker app](https://www.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker), which was developed by Martin, a new front-end engineer at ACI. This tool provides a comprehensive overview of recognized delegates, detailing their voting power and participation rates, thus enhancing the visibility of delegate contributions and engagement within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidaq56t2akvacel6xwg6kasz3ktw3f7lck3ysvn7xodfxbpnp5wju)\n    \n\nThe eligibility criteria for Orbit renewal emphasize participation rate, power, and platform maturity, ensuring that only the most dedicated and impactful delegates are compensated. These criteria are designed to balance the quality of governance participation with the cost-effectiveness of the Orbit program.\n\nTo define eligibility for renewal of Orbit, we propose the following requirements:\n\n- Not an Aave Service Provider\n- Minimum 20k voting power\n- Minimum 70% participation rate\n- Minimum 120 days since delegate platform creation\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed compensation for eligible delegates matching the requirements:\n\n|Delegate Platform|Retro-Payment (GHO)|New Stream (GHO)|Total Cost (GHO)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|EzR3al|5000|15000|20000|\n|Stable Labs|5000|15000|20000|\n|LBS Blockchain|5000|15000|20000|\n|Michigan|5000|15000|20000|\n|Total|20000|60000|80000|\n\nIn terms of gas rebate, we included Gov V2 reimbursement & payload-related activity in the following table:\n\n|Delegate / Service Provider | Gas Used (ETH)|\n|--- | ---|\n|ACI | 3.365|\n|Tokenlogic | 0.586|\n|Michigan | 0.276|\n|Wintermute | 0.2518|\n|LBS | 0.031|\n|StableLabs | 0.0342|\n|ezr3al | 0.3833|\n|**Total** | **4.9273**|\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n - [Orbit tracker app](https://www.aavechan.com/orbit-tracker) \n - Gov V2 [script output](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gov-V2-Gas-rebate-Feb-2024-Script-output-e7df604934434435849f71b4105a9d43?pvs=4)\n- Gov V3 [script output](https://www.notion.so/aavechan/Gov-V3-Payload-Script-output-cee4e7ce8b7048b58ec874a4b1499aa3)\n- Gov V2 [script code](https://github.com/JosepBove/aave-gov-gas)\n- Gov V3 [script code](https://github.com/AaveChan/aave-gov3-gas/tree/master)\n\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Period Coverage:** Blocks 18040579 (Sep 1st 2023) to 19162696 (5th feb 2024)\n- **Eligibility Criteria:** Non-Aave Service Providers, minimum 20k voting power, 70% participation rate, and 120 days since platform creation.\n- **Budget:** 80000 GHO and 4.6755 ETH\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is achieved, move this proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage for implementation and funding allocation in cooperation with Aave Finance service providers via an ad-hoc AIP vote or bundled in one of their treasury managements AIPs.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is independent and has not received any form of compensation from related parties for the drafting of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

To effectively leverage this power and actively participate in pivotal governance decisions, such as LTIPs on Arbitrum, the creation of APE is essential.\nThis will allow the Aave DAO to have a mete-governance embassy represented by Aave DAO service providers and significant delegates.\n\n## Specification\n\nAPE will function as a 3/4 Gnosis SAFE multisig, holding governance tokens to cast votes on behalf of the Aave DAO. The proposed multisig structure requires a 3/4 signature for actions:\n\n- ACI (acting as the coordinator) : Delegate and service provider\n- Token Logic : Delegate and service provider\n- KarpatKey: Delegate and service provider\n- EzR3al : largest delegate platform\n\nThis proposal aims to seed this Multisig with Aave DAO ARB tokens currently held by the Aave Collector contract. [Aave Treasury V3](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x053D55f9B5AF8694c503EB288a1B7E552f590710)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Initiate a discussion within the Aave community to gather feedback on the proposal.\n2. Conduct a snapshot vote for community consensus.\n3. If successful, proceed with an AIP seeding the multisig with the ARB tokens\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative, along with the proposed multisig members, will manage APE with a commitment to representing Aave DAO's best interests in external protocol governance, without external compensation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "The Merit proposal introduces a new periodic reward system designed to incentivize user behaviors aligned with Aave's strategic objectives, primarily rewarding borrowing wETH and GHO and staking activities. The timeline metrics show a strong and stable lead for the YAE option, indicating clear voter support. Historical precedent shows previous Merit rounds increased protocol revenue and market share, with successful reductions in non-aligned protocol usage. Forum sentiment is mixed but with a slight lean towards positive for the proposal, with main concerns around the dilution of non-aligned protocols and complexity of the system. Market impacts of the current proposal show positive price and TVL increases, supporting a healthy protocol growth.",
