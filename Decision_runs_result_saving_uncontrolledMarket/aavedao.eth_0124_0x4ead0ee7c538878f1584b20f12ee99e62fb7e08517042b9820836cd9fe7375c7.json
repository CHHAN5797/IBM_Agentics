As a centralized and trusted entity in the cryptocurrency space, Coinbase’s entry into the wrapped Bitcoin market with cbBTC brings a unique value proposition to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nThis new asset will diversify the options available for Bitcoin holders looking to participate in DeFi activities on Aave v3. The introduction of cbBTC to Aave v3 will provide users with more choices for utilizing their Bitcoin holdings, increasing liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nFurthermore, cbBTC’s integration aligns with Aave’s commitment to offering a wide range of high-quality assets. It will enable users to tap into Coinbase’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. This synergy between a major centralized exchange and a leading DeFi protocol could attract more mainstream users to Aave, contributing to the overall growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n### Specification\nTicker: cbBTC\n\nContract addresses will be added during the ARFC stage once cbBTC has been fully launched.\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Coinbase and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "## **Author: ACI**\n\n## **Date: 2024-10-04**\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Summary:**\n\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard EIGEN, the native token of Eigenlayer, in Aave V3 Ethereum Market. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Eigenlayer Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of EIGEN.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

RLUSD intends to bridge TradFi with DeFi use cases, starting with its flagship payments products serving customers in over 70 markets. They aim to establish RLUSD as the de facto stablecoin for lending/borrowing, DeFi, repo, Treasury functions, payments, etc., all within the highest levels of compliance.\n\nOnboarding Ripple's RLUSD extends Aave Protocol's diverse stablecoin offerings to its users. RLUSD users on Aave Protocol may potentially benefit from future rewards programs. This introduction is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nAligning with Aave DAO’s commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand assets, onboarding RLUSD will enable users to leverage Ripple’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. The initial slow launch of RLUSD is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and attract more mainstream users, contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n## Specification- **Ticker**: RLUSD  \n- Contract addresses will be added during the ARFC stage once RLUSD is fully launched.  - Risk parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers as soon as possible, and the ARFC will be updated with that feedback\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Ripple and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, escalate the proposal to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

EURC is Circle’s EUR backed stablecoin.\n\nMotivation\n-\nCircle is an established stablecoin issuer mainly known for USDC. EURC is their EUR based stablecoin and we believe it will be a great addition as it enables stablecoin diversity. EURC has also shown significant adoption and usage on Avalanche network with over $2M of liquidity on TraderJoe pool.\nBy onboarding EURC, we believe that the DeFi synergies created for users depositing or borrowing EURC on Aave will be a net positive for Aave and the Avalanche ecosystem.\n\nSpecification\n-\nProject: https://www.circle.com/en/\nDocumentation: https://www.circle.com/en/eurc\nAvalanche Contract: 0xC891EB4cbdEFf6e073e859e987815Ed1505c2ACD\nChainlink oracle: EACAggregatorProxy | Address 0x3368310bC4AeE5D96486A73bae8E6b49FcDE62D3 | SnowTrace 2\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n\nRisk parameters can be defined by ChaosLabs and Gauntlet at the ARFC stage after TEMP CHECK reaches consensus.\n\n\nDisclaimer\n-\nKeyrock is not presenting this Temp Check on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this Temp Check. Keyrock holds EURC inventory as part of our liquidity provisioning operations.\n\nNext Steps\n-\n1. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n2. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage using the Skyward program from the ACI (@MarcZeller).\n\nCopyright\n-\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
