        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/918\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Optimism, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Optimism: 0x2218a117083f5B482B0bB821d27056Ba9c04b1D3\n\nsDAI/aUSDC Optimism pool on Gyro: [Gyroscope Protocol](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/optimism/e-clp/0x876e0a21626c33bdab879330505eccc6091aa607/)\n\nChild chain gauge: [[Vyper_contract | Address 0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340 | OP Mainnet Etherscan ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340)]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf\n\ngaugeType(string): Optimism",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/693\n\n**Summary:**\n> Balancer's core focus has been yield bearing liquidity for quite some time. As of recent [sDAI](https://app.spark.fi/sdai/) and [sFRAX](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake) have become popular yield bearing stablecoins in the greater defi ecosystem. This proposal is meant to enable four gauges encompassing these tokens on Ethereum and Arbitrum in stable and weighted pools. The pool will sufficiently capture which captures the yield of these tokens and creates routing for the 3 primary stablecoins and wstETH to be swapped against. The pools all will be core for Balancer.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Maker Webiste](https://makerdao.com/en/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/dai/dsr-manager-docs/dsr-manager-docs.md)    \n    • [Communities](https://forum.makerdao.com/)\n> Link to: \n    • [Frax Webiste](https://app.frax.finance/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/src/types/constants.ts)    \n    • [Communities](https://gov.frax.finance/)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sDAI is part of the Maker ecosystem and utilizes the Dai Savings Rate to incentivize users to stake their DAI here https://app.spark.fi/sdai/ . \n>\n>sFRAX is from the new Frax v3 ecosystem and can be utilized [here](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake). \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer users will have a more capital efficient place to provide stable coin liquidity routes. As core pools these will receive BAL incentives over time via the BIP-19 cycle. sDAI and sFRAX will overall earn the DAO more revenue and strengthen the routing for swaps on Balancer using the underlying tokens.  \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module). Frax governance is outlined [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-governance/frax-governance-overview). \n\n2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on the [SavingsDAIRateProvider](https://0xc7177B6E18c1Abd725F5b75792e5F7A3bA5DBC2c) to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/SavingsDAIRateProvider.md). The sFRAX and wstETH oracles utilize the Chainlink feed factory or have been proven by being utilized for over a year on the platform. \n\n3. **Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits). \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n5. **Market History:** sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai). sFRAX history can be seen [here](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xfef79304c80a694dfd9e603d624567d470e1a0e7?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults). \n \n6. **Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin and wstETH liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and sFRAX.\n\nsDAI/3Pool - Mainnet\nPool: [0x49cbD67651fbabCE12d1df18499896ec87BEf46f](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x49cbd67651fbabce12d1df18499896ec87bef46f00000000000000000000064a)\nGauge: [0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4)\n\nsDAI/wstETH - Mainnet\nPool: [0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf1](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf100020000000000000000064b)\nGauge: [0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108)\n\nsFRAX/4POOL - Arbitrum \nPool: [0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27#readContract)\nChild: [0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd)\nRoot: [0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83](https://etherscan.io/address/0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83)\n\nsFRAX/wstETH - Arbitrum\nPool:  [0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f160](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f1600002000000000000000004de)\nChild: [0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653)\nRoot: [0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nThe pool will have the `core pool` status as per BIP-457",

Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 0.5 basis points, i.e., 0.005% at pool inception. A protocol fee of 30% will be set upon incentives going live. This may be changed later upon mutual discussion (this is a new Rehype pool type and fees and growth may need to be fine tuned).

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/917\n\n**Summary:**\nJito proposes a Balancer Gauge for a jitoSOL/wSOL and jitoSOL/stETH pool on Arbitrum, with uncapped emissions. Both pools are yield bearing and will be considered core pools.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\nWebsite: https://www.jito.network/\nDocumentation: https://www.jito.network/docs/jitosol/overview/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jito_sol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\nJito is the liquid staking service for Solana that distributes MEV (maximum extractable value) rewards to holders. The Jito Stake Pool enables users to stake their Solana tokens in exchange for a liquid stake pool token (JitoSOL). The JitoSOL token provides liquidity while earning a combination of staking rewards and MEV rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\nJito is seeking to establish a presence on EVM, utilizing Wormhole technology, with jitoSOL/wSOL and jitoSOL/wstETH pools on Arbitrum as its main liquidity sources to further enrich liquidity for jitoSOL on EVM. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Jito community.\n\n**Specifications:**\nJitoSOL can be unstaked in between two and four days. Additionally, JitoSOL-SOL is the second most liquid trading pair on Solana, with $30m in TVL as of today across 7 pools. \n\n**Governance:**\n\nJito DAO governance is managed by a Discourse forum for conversation, and a Realms interface for executing votes (the Solana equivalent of Snapshot and most popular governance platform on the chain). Links: https://gov.jito.network/ and https://forum.jito.network/ \n\nThe Jito Network and Jito Foundation are controlled by the DAO. It has a constitution with the formal powers but basically the DAO controls all assets in Realms (revenue + JTO), JitoSOL delegation strategy and fees.\n\nA delegation program was started in January with 17 delegates granted 12mm JTO to kickstart governance. There are regular public calls on topical issues.\n\nThe first JIP recently passed, changing the JitoSOL Stake Pool delegation parameters. Forum discussion and vote.\n\nJito hopes to continue increasing governance participation and several more JIPs are expected in the next month.\n\n**Oracles:**\nPyth is the primary oracle, though there are a handful of Switchboard oracles as well.\n\n**Audits:**\njitoSOL is built on the stake pool program developed by Solana Labs. The program has been supporting numerous implementations since the network launched and three firms have completed audits (reports).\n\nLiquid staking non-custodial so Jito does not have access to funds deposited in jitoSOL. Even if Jito were to disappear, holders could still withdraw their SOL from validators along with accumulated rewards.\n\nJito does have control over validator selection and fees. Jito manages this risk by using a multi-sig operation with over 5 members of the founding team. The majority of the team needs to agree for any changes to take place. Jito will work to diversify the members over time to include other respected constituents from Solana.\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\nJitoSOL is built on the stake pool program developed by Solana Labs. The program has been supporting numerous implementations since the network launched and three firms have completed audits (reports).\n\nLiquid staking is non-custodial so Jito DAO or contributors do not have access to funds deposited in JitoSOL. Even if Jito contributors were to disappear, holders could still withdraw their SOL from validators along with accumulated rewards.\n\nThe JitoSOL Stake Pool program is currently controlled by a multisig containing several Solana ecosystem contributors. This multisig implements the delegation strategy chosen by DAO. This will migrate to StakeNet so it’s programmatically controlled during Q2.\n\nJito DAO proposals can be vetoed by a Security Council of five individuals via Emergency Actions. After performing any Emergency Action, the Security Council must issue a full transparency report to explain what was done and why such Emergency Action was justified. The DAO is able to curtail or eliminate the Security Council's power to perform Emergency Actions via approval and implementation of a Jito Improvement Proposal. A handful of the current Security Council members are pseudonymous.\n\n**Value:**\nThe jitoSOL/wSOL and jitoSOL/wstETH pools on Balancer are intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the jitoSOL tokens on Arbitrum.\n\n**Specifications:**\njitoSOL on Arbitrum:0x83e1d2310Ade410676B1733d16e89f91822FD5c3\n\nWrapped SOL on Arbitrum: 0x2bcC6D6CdBbDC0a4071e48bb3B969b06B3330c07\n\njitoSOL/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer:\n\nhttps://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x260dbd54d87a10a0fc9d08622ebc969a3bf4e6bb000200000000000000000536\n\nChild: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xfA7C98b893b26e99EFb53110B1B72FFAaC607b69 \nRoot: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6Bf6fb94027FDe38B40C7ADC154AA32C36174C8E \n\njitoSOL/SOL Arbitrum pool on Balancer:\n\njitoSOL/SOL\nhttps://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xfb2f7ed572589940e24c5711c002adc59d5e79ef000000000000000000000535  \n\nChild: https://arbiscan.io/address/0xAa5A381b23667902ad6EdBd060B3A9bb7Caeb24B\nRoot: https://etherscan.io/address/0x7542967F91fD6EE8433A41B22C2be8972A002CA5 \n\n**Technical Specification:**\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x6Bf6fb94027FDe38B40C7ADC154AA32C36174C8E\ngaugeType(string): Arbitrum\n\ngauge(address): 0x7542967F91fD6EE8433A41B22C2be8972A002CA5\ngaugeType(string): Arbitrum",
