ARB is Arbitrum's governance token, an ERC-20 token native to the Arbitrum One chain.\n\n## Motivation\n\nArbitrum represents a governance token in the Ethereum scaling ecosystem. It is widely distributed, initially across 625,000 wallet addresses - including to DAOs like Aave.\n\nAdding support for ARB in Arbitrum v3 pools adds greater TVL and user experience to the increasingly popular Aave v3 Arbitrum market - and additional revenue opportunities for Aave. \n\nBy enabling borrowing, it allows users and institutions to take a unique position on this Governance token as the network matures and builds a decentralized community.\n\nFurthermore, it more closely aligns the Aave community with Arbitrum and, by extension, Ethereum.\n\n## Specifications\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\n   * @Fig is a Governance Contributor at Flipside Crypto, a  professional delegate and contributor to Aave, Maker, Optimism, 0x, and additionally Arbitrum.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\n   *  Arbitrum Rollup and Arbitrum AnyTrust are protocols that make Ethereum transactions faster and cheaper. Developers use Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova, the chains that implement these protocols, respectively, to build user-friendly decentralized apps.\n* The distribution of the $ARB governance token decentralizes governance of these protocols and their respective chains, as well as any future chains the Arbitrum DAO authorizes.\n* $ARB tokens can be used to vote on Arbitrum DAO governance proposals, allowing $ARB holders to shape Arbitrum's future together\n\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\n  * Owning $ARB makes you a member of the Arbitrum DAO and allows you to participate in Arbitrum's on-chain governance. A series of smart contracts are responsible for bridging $ARB between Arbitrum One and Ethereum. This will benefit the Aave community by creating a vibrant ecosystem around Aave v3 Arbitrum while being a strong primary use case for ARB.\n\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO, is it live? Products, are they live? How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\n  * Arbitrum DAO governs a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain, represented by delegates and individual token holders. Arbitrum One is built by Offchain Labs, and the DAO is serviced by the Arbitrum Foundation. The Arbitrum Foundation has been seeded as of April 2023 - dedicated to the decentralization, security & growth of Arbitrum technologies, including Arbitrum One & Nova.\n\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**\n\n* $ARB makes you a member of the Arbitrum DAO and allows you to participate in Arbitrum's on-chain governance. ARB is currently traded on Coinbase Exchange, Binance, and Uniswap.\n\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nFor the initial airdrop, 12.75% of the ARB supply was distributed across 600,000+ wallets. The distribution was broken down into individuals and DAOs:\n\n* 11.62% of tokens will be initially distributed to users \n* 1.13% distributed to DAOs in the Arbitrum ecosystem *(including Aave)*\n\nThe remaining 87.25%  of the token supply is distributed as the following:\n\n* 35.28% to the Arbitrum DAO treasury overseen by governance protocol\n* 7.5% to the Arbitrum Foundation (as approved by the DAO)\n* 26.94% to the Offchain Labs team and future advisers\n* 17.53% to Offchain Labs investors\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\n* The $ARB token is minted by a [smart contract](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548#code) that lives on Arbitrum One, a Layer 2 Arbitrum rollup chain.

        "body": "---\naip: <to be assigned>\ntitle: Add FEI to Aave V2\nstatus: Proposed\nauthor: Joey Santoro (@joeysantoro), Brianna Montgomery (@bpm6867)\nshortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the FEI stablecoin\ndiscussions: https://discord.gg/aDeErjS6Dt\ncreated: 2021-06-16\nupdated: N/A\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in lending markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: lending, synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n27K followers on Twitter, 2 17k members in Discord 3, Github\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\tDate of Deployment: March 28, 2021\n\tNumber of Transactions: 81,798\n\tNumber of Holders: 4,089\n\n## Rationale\nBecause FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing and lending. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0x08bbB5922550e6992ebDA8252A31AA02924EF28A\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0xa4893779e193AbD23CE494e5400ca340033606C7\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0xa4767eA500bc04430dE609A523CDc99c9537867C\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0x9f7663e34a2c2Be586126Eed5AF4651b062a51A6\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
