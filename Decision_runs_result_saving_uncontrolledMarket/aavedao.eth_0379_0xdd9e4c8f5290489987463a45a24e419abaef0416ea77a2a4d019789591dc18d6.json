The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired.

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5.

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Base\n\nAuthor: @fig - Flipside Crypto\n\nDate: 2023-05-22\n\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check seeks the community's input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Base mainnet, expanding Aave to a unique, OP-stack network.\n\n## Background\n\nBase is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.\n\nCoinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.\n\nDocs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)\n\nIts mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***\n\nAs a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.\n\nFour key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:\n\n\n**Open-source**\n\nBase is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.\n\n\n\n\n**A bridge, not an island**\n\nBase is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.\n\n\n\n**Decentralization** \n\n Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy \"to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.\n\n\n**For everyone**\n\nBase is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.\n\n \nBase has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.\n\nPlease see the list below of robust launch partners:\n\n \n![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)\n    \n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.\n\nBy enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.\n\nBase is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.\n\nIn the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.\n\nSince Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:\n\n* 2,000,000 accounts created\n* 17,000,000 transactions\n* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests\n\nIn addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers (@Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of the token.\n\n|||||||\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|**Risk Parameter**|**wETH**|**USDC**|**wstETH**|**cbETH**||\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|NO|NO||\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|YES|YES||\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES||\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A||\n|Loan To Value|N/A|82.5%|70.0%|67.0%||\n|Liquidation Threshold|80%|85%|79%|74%||\n|Liquidation Bonus|82.5%|5%|7.2%|7.5%||\n|Reserve Factor|5%|10%|15%|15%||\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|10%|10%||\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|940|1200||\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|6000|10000||\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|0|0||\n|uOptimal|45%|80%|45%|45%||\n|Base|0%|0%|0.25%|0%||\n\n\n\nBase will deploy using the [Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data), which an overview can be found [here](https://static.optimism.io/#adding-a-token-to-the-list). The community may decide to list more assets on this market depending on risk tolerance.\n\nMore information on the [Network Specifications](https://docs.base.org/network-information) may be found here.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided above about Base is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.\n\nFor full disclosure, Coinbase partnered with Flipside Crypto upon the announcement of the network to make Base on-chain data available for free for analysts.\n\nCoinbase has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.\n\nAs a cautionary measure to prevent an appearance of a conflict of interest, Flipside will abstain from voting on this proposal - in line with other proposals we put forward.\n\nThis TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Base Mainnet.\n\n**ARFC:** If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP:** If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "Evmos proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Evmos blockchain to expand lending to the Evmos and greater Cosmos ecosystem. Evmos will be the port of entry to Cosmos for Ethereum users and vice-versa with the introduction of developer-focused incentives, interoperability across other Cosmos chains and interchain composability.\n\n**Summary**\n\nEvmos is an application-agnostic chain that will be interoperable with the Ethereum mainnet, EVM-compatible environments, and other BFT chains via IBC, making it easy for users and developers to interact seamlessly between chains. Rather than being competitive with Ethereum, Evmos aims to expand the functionality of the EVM to offer interoperability that enables new use cases. EVM bridges ([Nomad and Connext](https://evmos.blog/bridging-assets-to-evmos-with-nomad-and-connext-e8ec182145d5)) will integrate with Evmos shortly after mainnet launch to allow Ethereum and other EVM chains’ ERC-20 tokens to be available on Evmos and subsequently the entire Cosmos ecosystem via IBC.\n\nEvmos was founded by Federico Kunze Küllmer and Akash Khosla. Federico has been a core contributor to a number of Cosmos projects including Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, Core IBC, Gravity Bridge (formerly Peggy) and Sommelier. He has been building in the blockchain space since 2017 when he was an exchange student at UC Berkeley, where he joined Blockchain at Berkeley. Akash had been working in the Cosmos ecosystem at Anchorage and as a Co-Founder of Blockchain at Berkeley, the blockchain innovation hub where many of the original Cosmos developers started their careers. He’s been working on blockchain and cryptocurrencies since 2016 as a Software Engineer at Anchorage, Chain and Earn.com, in addition to contributing to open source projects like Interledger.\n\nThe Cosmos ecosystem has been growing steadily with new application-specific chains being launched every week. Interchain DEXes have been deployed on Cosmos, among which Osmosis is already the second-largest DEX token by Market Cap ([source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/osmosis)) and is in the top 10 dexes by volume and TVL despite only being live for six months ([source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/dex)), which demonstrates the rapid growth of activity in Cosmos. By deploying to Evmos, AAVE will be able to capture a significant amount of user activity and fill the need for reliable lending protocols in Cosmos. Evmos will also enable cross-chain applications to leverage AAVE’s liquidity while being deployed to other Cosmos chains such as Terra. All of this growth will be further catalyzed by Evmos’ native usage incentives which will give the Evmos community the opportunity to allocate 25% of the block allocation of EVMOS tokens through governance to support AAVE’s growth and development. Additionally, funds from the community pool can be allocated to liquidity mining incentives through governance.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThere is great potential for synergy between Evmos and Aave. The Evmos ecosystem has been growing quickly with our live testnet and is launching with all of the infrastructure, tools and clients that developers require to deploy their contracts, including node and validator operator services, indexers, oracles, bridges and more.\n\nEvmos goes above and beyond to align with developers and users through its [tokenomics](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b). Two key ways this alignment happens is through fee splits where EIP1559 is modified to give 50% of transaction fees to contract deployers rather than burning it as well as usage incentives which allocate 25% of all newly minted Evmos tokens to a usage incentive pool. This pool is fully controlled by governance enabling the community to allocate incentives for AAVE users. AAVE users have already been included in the Evmos RektDrop which rewards active Cosmos, Osmosis, and Ethereum users. You can read more about Evmos’ novel [tokenomics](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b) and the [RektDrop](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) in our blog.\n\n**References**\n\n💻 Developer Documentation:<https://evmos.dev/>\n\n👾 Official Discord:<https://discord.gg/evmos>\n\n🐙 GitHub:<https://github.com/tharsis/evmos>\n\n🕊 Twitter:<https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg>\n\n📯 Telegram:[@EvmosOrg](https://t.me/EvmosOrg)\n\n📄 Medium:<https://evmos.blog/>\n\n🖥 Evmos Website:[https://evmos.org](https://evmos.org/)\n\n**Specifications**\n\n- What is the link between the author of the proposal and Evmos?\n\n  - The author of this proposal is a core Evmos team member.\n\n- Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token:\n\n  - With a launch planned for February 2022, Evmos is an application-agnostic chain that will be interoperable with the Ethereum mainnet, EVM-compatible environments, and other BFT chains via IBC, making it easy for users and developers to interact seamlessly between chains. Evmos aims to be the port of entry to Cosmos from Ethereum, making it easy to deploy smart contracts that expand interoperability with the Cosmos ecosystem.\n  - Evmos’ native token, EVMOS, is used to secure the Evmos network through staking, to enable governance voting for network decisions, and to pay transactions fees on the network.\n\n  \n\n\n**Evmos and Cosmos Ecosystem Metrics**\n\n- \\>1,300 validators participated in the Evmos incentivized testnet\n\n- 3 native dexes coming to Evmos\n\n- Cosmos Ecosystem Market Cap is valued at over $124.5 billion collectively ([source](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/tokens))\n\n- Osmosis, the primary interchain DEX of Cosmos has the second highest market cap for DEX tokens, being surpassed only by Uniswap\n\n  - Osmosis has a TVL of $1.2B\n\n- IBC usage growth with over 5M IBC transactions over the last 30 days and 600 channels and IBC-enabled chains have a market cap of over $56 billion.\n\n- Over 30 IBC-enabled chains with many more launching in early 2022\n\n\n\n**Audience data**\n\n- Twitter (@EvmosOrg): 31K\n- Telegram (@EvmosOrg): 6.4K\n- Discord (discord.gg/evmos): 25.6K\n\n**Incentives**\n\nOne of the key designs Evmos focused on is offering developer and user incentives natively. While many protocols deploy funds from foundations and make unilateral decisions of which protocols should benefit from them, Evmos offers a governance-controlled usage incentives pool which is funded by 25% of the block emission. This enables the community to allocate a portion of usage incentives to AAVE users to encourage organic growth of the protocol and increase its adoption.\n\nIn 4 years, this will total 200 million Evmos tokens. The size of this pool is large because users are the backbone of any crypto project. Usage Incentive rewards are based on gas spent on contract interactions and rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch (1-week).\n\nIn addition to Usage Rewards, token holders can leverage governance on Evmos to allocate a portion of the community pool to additional liquidity mining rewards. The community pool accounts for 10% of the supply which can be used to fund incentive programs.\n\n**Technical Specifications**\n\nEvmos will have support for The Graph, Gnosis Safe, and we are actively working with Chainlink to finalize support to enable a fully functional Aave v3 deployment by mainnet.\n\n**Initial Supported Assets**\n\n- USDC\n- USDT\n- DAI\n- FRAX\n- AAVE\n- WETH\n- WBTC\n- OSMO\n- EVMOS\n- ATOM\n",

On Aave v3, the most recent Aave deployment, wstETH provides $130M or 29% of markets TVL.\n\nSeveral communities building on Aave utilize the wstETH/wETH rewards-maximizing strategy to generate rewards on various assets. By adding wstETH to the Polygon v3 market, users gain access to a third Liquid Staking Token (LST) source of rewards. \n\nThe demand for wETH on Aave has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave v2. This led to a material increase in Aave’s wETH nominated revenue stream. Listing wstETH across various Aave deployments, has enabled Aave to offer the higher APR on wETH deposits, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. \n\nBy listing wstETH on Polygon, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating a similar outcome to that of the Ethereum Aave v2 and v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YdpSsO9.png)\n\nThe utilization of wETH on Polygon is 10.07%, compared to 48.37% on the Ethereum v2 wETH Reserve. Listing wstETH on Polygon v3 will increase TVL for Aave and generate new demand for wETH borrowing, creating demand for wETH deposits and driving growth for Aave.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0wU6pjs.png)\n\n# Specification\n\n### 1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nJacob is a full time contributor to the Lido DAO.\n\n### 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nLido is the name given to a suite of liquid staking smart contract systems deployed across multiple blockchain network platforms. The smart contract systems are software middleware that extend the functionality of the networks by enabling more participants to stake the network native token. \n\nThe Lido on Ethereum software is deployed on the Ethereum network. When participants use it to route their stake, they enhance the security of the Ethereum network by increasing the number of participants who stake ETH. \n\nLido on Ethereum does not record the wallet address of participants that use it. Instead participants use the middleware to mint a rebasing stETH utility token to themselves when they route their stake. The utility tokens are fungible and liquid. The total balance of stETH in existence is based on the total amount of ETH staked via the Lido on Ethereum middleware plus total staking rewards minus any slashing applied on validators. stETH rebases daily.\n\nDue to the rebasing nature of stETH, a user’s stETH balance changes daily as staking rewards are reported  from the consensus layer. As some DeFi protocols require a constant balance mechanism for tokens, stETH can be wrapped into wstETH which keeps a user’s token balance fixed and uses deterministic code to account for users’ staking reward balances.\n\nExample of an unwrapping scenario:\n\n1) User wraps 1 stETH and gets 0.9803 wstETH (1 stETH = 0.9803 wstETH)\n2) A rebase happens, the wstETH price goes up by 5%\n3) User unwraps 0.9803 wstETH and gets 1.0499 stETH (1 stETH = 0.9337 wstETH)\n\nWhen withdrawals are enabled on the Ethereum network, by the Ethereum Foundation, wstETH user’s can unwrap the tokens to stETH and then burn the tokens to use the withdrawal functionality of middleware and get their stake and accumulated rewards.\n\nwstETH on Polygon: [`0x03b54A6e9a984069379fae1a4fC4dBAE93B3bCCD`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x03b54a6e9a984069379fae1a4fc4dbae93b3bccd)\n\n### 3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nThe below shows the effect that listing of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum Mainnet deployment. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and the resulting fee-revenue. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l3DDeWz.png)\n\nThe wETH reserve generated approximately $279k in revenue during January, $244k during February and has already generated $234k by mid March 2023.\n\n### 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe below provides a brief overview and some key dates of interest providing insight into the history to stETH and wstETH:\n\n*  stETH deployed on 17th December 2020\n*  stETH listed on Aave v2 on the 27th February 2022\n*  wstETH deployed 5th August 2022\n*  wstETH listed on Ethereum v3 27th January 2023\n*  wstETH listed on Optimism v3 24th February 2023\n*  wstETH listed on Arbitrum v3 1st March 2023\n\nLido Protocol stETH is considered the most dominant staked ETH utility token across the industry. stETH tokens make up 31.4% of all staked ETH deposits. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HMvo9Dk.png)\n\n### 5. How is wstETH currently used?\n\nAave v2 on Ethereum is the largest holder of stETH.\n\nDeploying wstETH on Polygon, along with on other networks like Optimism and Arbitrum, will make the token available to Aave users on Layer 2 networks in the same way stETH is available on Ethereum Mainnet. It will also enable DeFi protocols to build interesting and exciting new use cases by utilizing integration with Aave to access the wstETH market.\n\nInstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO, CIAN and others have all built products on top of Aave utilizing the recursive stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Polygon Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Polygon.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZxJuzib.png)\n\nOn Polygon, wstETH is mostly used for providing liquidity on Balancer. In time, this pool will be migrated to wstETH / bb-a-wETH and a gauge will be created to distribute rewards to Liquidity Providers who stake their BPTs. \n\n## 6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n### 7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nFor details on stETH, which is already listed on Aave v2 Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism please refer to the following forum posts:\n\n\n*  https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-steth-lido/5793\n*  https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-arbitrum-aave-v3/11387\n*  https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-wsteth-to-aave-v3-on-optimism/10932\n\nTransferring wstETH from Ethereum to Polygon occurs via the Polygon [canonical bridge](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-l2-third-edition-polygon/4068) provided by the Polygon Foundation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eHijlXK.png)\n\n### 8.
