As productive assets, staking tokens are high quality collateral to borrow against.\n\nGiven their high correlation to ETH, LRTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nThe onboarding of ezETH will consequently create increased ezETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of ezETH.\n\n## **Chain to be deployed/listed**\n\nEthereum mainnet.\n\n## **Relevant KPI & Points Rewards**\n\nRenzo awards ezPoints and EigenLayer Restaked Points based on users’ ezETH holdings. Every user that deposits ezETH as collateral in Aave will also be awarded ezPoints and EigenLayer points 1:1.\n\nAs relevant KPI for the Protocol:\n\n- Total Value Locked: $1.9 billion\n\n- Total supply: 526K+ Renzo Restaked ETH\n\n- 24H trading volume: $80,203,780\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[Renzo Protocol](https://www.renzoprotocol.com/)\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.renzoprotocol.com/docs)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol)\n\n[Audits](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol/contracts-public/blob/master/Audit/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment.pdf)\n\n[Chainlink Data Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ezeth-eth)\n\n[Composable Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Renzo Protocol for creating this proposal.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1.

The token allows users to participate in the staking rewards while maintaining the flexibility to use their staked assets within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nOnboarding slisBNB will allow Aave users to utilize it as collateral, thus broadening the asset base and enhancing overall liquidity.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments\n\nUsers who supply slisBNB liquidity on Aave, will be eligible to get stardust (points) from Lista's ongoing point system Cosmic Adventure Challenge Season 3, which will turn to LISTA token airdrop when Season 3 ends.\n\n### Specification\n\nToken Name: slisBNB\n\nUnderlying Asset: Staked BNB\n\nContract: 0xB0b84D294e0C75A6abe60171b70edEb2EFd14A1B\n\n> Risk Parameters and analysis have been provided by Risk Service Providers so ARFC has been be updated accordingly.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|E-Mode Category|None|\n|Supply Cap|20,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|55%|\n|LT|60%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.50%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nhttps://lista.org/\n\nhttps://lista.org/liquid-staking/BNB\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

As weETH has already been approved for onboarding to Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base by the DAO, this proposal extends the onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Scroll.\n\n## **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:**\n\nweETH deposits into Aave on Scroll will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points and Scroll Marks.\n\n## **Specification:**\n\nweETH on Scroll: [0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506)\n\nweETH/ETH Chainlink Feed: [0x57bd9E614f542fB3d6FeF2B744f3B813f0cc1258](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x57bd9E614f542fB3d6FeF2B744f3B813f0cc1258)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers and the ARFC will be updated following their feedback.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (weETH)|2,000|\n|Borrow Cap (weETH)|400|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|72.50%|\n|LT|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.50%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|ETH-correlated|\n\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[Ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\n[weETH Base onboarding](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboarding-of-weeth-to-aave-v3-on-base/17691)\n\n[weETH Arbitrum onboarding](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=76&ipfsHash=0x78778591515790b337fcdcc2a02d49dc58e98cad614c33d61e1173bc6194729d)\n\n[weETH Onboarding](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=74&ipfsHash=0x227ef8b0f49775f64100ec697bc4e67b0739bd1ff08788b1f6b48a66e1d57bf7)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n**Title:** [ARFC] Onboard osETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum \n**Author:** ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n**Date:** 2024-03-11\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nThis is a ARFC proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s new over-collateralized staked ETH token, osETH, on AAVE V3 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLiquid staking tokens (LSTs) have proven to be popular collateral assets on Aave, with Lido’s stETH the largest Reserve across all Aave deployments and rETH quickly reaching its supply caps. As productive assets, LSTs are high quality collateral to borrow against. Given their high correlation to ETH, LSTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nosETH in particular is overcollateralized by design, providing in-built slashing protection and consequently an increased level of protection for the Aave protocol…\n\nAs StakeWise V3 provides solo stakers to ability to mint osETH against their own nodes, on-boarding osETH will benefit Aave, StakeWise, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and be an important step in the pursuit to diversify Ethereum staking and encourage staking from home.\n\nThe onboarding of osETH will consequently create increased osETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and StakeWise protocols, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of osETH.\n\n## Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nEthereum mainnet\n\n## Specification:\n\nosETH contract address:\n\n[0xf1C9acDc66974dFB6dEcB12aA385b9cD01190E38](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf1C9acDc66974dFB6dEcB12aA385b9cD01190E38)\n\n| Risk Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Emode | No |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| Stable Borrow | No |\n| Enable Borrow | Yes |\n| Enable Collateral | Yes |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 71% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 76% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n| Supply Cap | 15000 osETH |\n| Borrow Cap | 1000 osETH |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 45% |\n| Base | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 7% |\n| Slope2 | 300% |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-oseth-to-aave-v3-on-ethereum-pool/15636)\n\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xef2124e2d2e756649f133338c2a876f61be19b7a5ace7df58326f1df034c6d5d)\n\n[Website](https://www.stakewise.io/)\n\n[V3Litepaper](https://www.stakewise.io/stakewise-v3.pdf)\n\n[Audits](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io)\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/StakeWise)\n[Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Stakewise for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3.

        "body": "## [ARFC]  Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum\n\n## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-08-12\n---\n\n> ARFC has been updated with Risk Parameters provided by both Risk Service Providers after having reservations with exchange rate oracles. 2024-08-12\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 800 Mn+ (~270k Eth) TVL\n- 20K+ restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH, sfrxETH, and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\n*> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-08-09 and ARFC has been updated.* It is recommended listing rsETH using an exchange rate oracle. \n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 19,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,900 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-Correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9.83% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn\n    - Few others\n- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)\n\n**Oracles**:\n\nrsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:\n\nChainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6\n\nChainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nRedstone market feed:\n\n[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nrsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.\n\nAccepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.\n\nExchange rate calculation -\n\nA → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain\n\nB → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]\n\nC → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]\n\nD → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]\n\nE → Total supply of rsETH\n\nExchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nPrior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. \n\nNevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n* [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n* Contract Address:[ 0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n* [GitHub Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
