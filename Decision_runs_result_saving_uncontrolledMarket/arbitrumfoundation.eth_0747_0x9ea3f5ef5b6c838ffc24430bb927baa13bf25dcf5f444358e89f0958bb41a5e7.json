It is a public-access metagovernance block. With the aim of enfranchising the tens of thousands of small voters, this proposal suggests we delegate (not grant) 7,000,000 ARB to a public access-voter block subject to a 1 year renewal. This delegation gets mobilized by Voter Pass and Gitcoin Pass holders functionally giving underrepresented DAO citizens multiplied voting power and therefore more incentive to express their voices. The Gitcoin DAO has [recently passed](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb2094445891a515a6c58d8b44c4c2428e66d2e5f1f1e81a2741036eb97e6d6e8) a proposal supporting Event Horizon, thereby making our Citizen Enfranchisement pool the #6 delegate on Gitcoin. \n\nWe also request a grant of 50k ARB to help the team maintain this public good across this 1 year experiment in addition to retroactively awarding the team for the fully-functional product thus far built out of pocket for the Arbitrum community over the past several months. \n\n## Problem\n\nToday, typical Arbitrum voter participation rate floats in the low single digits. However, there are thousands of individual voters who participate in each vote despite having effectively no meaningful say. They should be rewarded with a voice. Moreover, there are likely tens of thousands more incredibly talented community members who are very capable of adding to the collective cognition of the ecosystem, but simply lack the capital means to have a voice and are left discouraged from voting at all. Not voting when you only have, say, $500 worth of ARB doesn’t make sense, it’s a drop in the bucket. Sitting out governance proposals is, unfortunately, the rational decision but collectively makes everyone worse off. The strength of the DAO is directly related to the number of participants having their voices heard by the community. The governance platform and vote multiple that Event Horizon gives to these citizens incentivizes greater participation: our average participation rate is 30%.\n\n## Mechanism\n\nArbitrum Citizens interested in governance may mint a free, soul-bound Voter Pass which allows them to take part in mobilizing this voter enfranchisement pool subject to an additional Gitcoin Pass requirement to prevent sybil attacks to be implemented soon after delegation. As detailed further below, this model:\n\n1. Grants a clear and meaningful voice to statistically low capital DAO citizen voters regardless of their financial means\n2. Incentives participation with additional governance authority, not inflationary rewards\n3. Incentives participants interested in governance itself, not financial gain\n\nDAOs today rely exclusively on individuals and company entities to serve as network delegates. However, this isn’t the only option. While individual delegates certainly add incredible value to the Arbitrum Ecosystem, so would a governance allotment dedicated to the greater body of smaller citizen participants.\n\nIn this regard, Event Horizon slots into the Arbitrum ecosystem in a similar fashion to a standard delegate. However, rather than the block voting based on the decision of one individual, it votes with the collective cognition of hundreds of individual voter pass holders.\n\nThis serves two functions:\n\n1. It provides a clear and designated voice for smaller, citizen voters.\n2. It drives participation through a game-theoretic process called Implicit Delegation.\n\nOne of the greatest barriers to participation is lack of voice due to lack of capital. Implicit delegation and public access governance changes this. Implicit Delegation is a model by which the full public governance block mobilizes in favor of the consensus of those who do vote, thereby implicitly delegating the authority of those who don’t vote to those who do.\n\nWhen participation is low… each voter receives a larger slice of the public access pie. This means the fewer people there are voting, the more incentive there is for someone new to come and participate.\n\nWhen participation is high… there are more voters splitting the same pie, however, citizen participation is high, which is a win for the ecosystem.\n\nWhere Direct Governance allocates influence along the lines of capital, and Explicit Delegation allocates influence along the lines of popularity (which often reflects capital), Implicit Delegation allocates influence to those who care most: people showing up to vote. \n\nBecause the entirety of the block is always mobilized, those who are most vested are rewarded for their participation by having a larger share of the voting pie. In this regard, Event Horizon’s model leans into a systemic lack of participation to create a solution.\n\n## Rationale\n\n7,000,000 ARB would place the Event Horizon community as the 15th largest delegate. Based upon significant dialogue with existing Arbitrum delegates and stakeholders, we think this places a fair amount of power into the 3rd pillar of governance, namely citizens (the other two being organizational and individual delegations) without being large enough to flip any typical proposal.\n\n## Benefits compared to Token Incentivized Governance:\n\nWhile token rewards for participation hold legitimate merit and are an intuitive remedy for low turnout, it has limitations.\n\nMisaligned Incentives: Token-based incentives attract returns-interested parties. However, when it comes to governance, participation is most valuable when it comes from those interested in participating not payout. Implicit delegation directly appeals to these individuals as it rewards those who participate, not with capital, but with greater voting power.\n\nAdded Thought Capital: in line with the notion above, there are likely thousands, of community members each holding both strong ideas and valuable contributions for the ecosystem, but simply lack enough voice to justify participation. Through Implicit Delegation, any community member of the Arbitrum ecosystem has an opportunity to have their voice heard, bringing thousands more minds and ideas to the surface.\n\nInflationary: While token rewards drive participation at the expense of inflation, Implicit delegation simply leverages its game theory model to increase incentive to vote in the form of a greater voting share. This does not cost the token any inflation, nor the treasury any ARB.\n\nNon-scalable: Token-based rewards are finite and require a constant drain of ARB funds to continue driving participation. As the ecosystem scales, and more participants join, greater and greater sums of ARB will be needed to continue fueling growth. Implicit delegation has no cost, and its balanced game theory functions with no burn. \n\n## Specification\n\n**Past Performance**\n\nThe above is not just theory. The Event Horizon community is already active on Ethereum providing meta-governing public goods to Uniswap, AAVE, Compound, ShapeShift, and of course, Arbitrum. In fact, in several recent Uniswap votes, the Event Horizon community was the 10th largest voter in the Uniswap Ecosystem. Event Horizon has also recently voted as the 8th largest delegate in recent Aave votes. Gitcoin DAO just voted to make Event Horizon the 6th largest delegate in the DAO via delegation.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.03.39 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeibev6xxizm6o3t75i6ykaepxsdsst7uusfhrfnjcg7dwdhweu76qe)\n    \nSince its inception, the Event Horizon protocol has placed over $28M of governance authority and enfranchisement directly into the hands of the citizen voter, a feat not seen anywhere else in the DAO space. Some more metrics worth highlighting:\n\nVotes Processed on Behalf of Retail voters: $28,000,000\nNumber of Metagovernance Proposals Passed: ~250\nVoter Participation: >30%\nAverage Authority Mobilized Multiple: >8,000x \n    \n## Mechanisms\n\nStep 1 – Duplication: Once a delegation is established, Event Horizon begins automatically duplicating all base DAO (in this case Arbitrum) proposals within its own voting portal.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.02 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeicutfnm3gvojnx6pfd6ei2omh2frxwzcasj6ujthwznw7pagwlm7e)\n\nStep 2 – Metagovernance: Retail voters may mint a free voter pass and begin voting to decide how the retail enfranchisement pool is mobilized in the base DAO proposal.\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.29 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreihuusuap534xe3r2mypdroiw4xri6orova73u62v6snbxvrsaqrpi)\n    \nStep 3 – Base DAO Voting: 24 hours prior to the closure of the base DAO proposal, the Event Horizon metagovernance proposal closes. Event Horizon then automatically pushes the consensus decision established by the retail community during the metagovernance proposal into the base DAO proposal.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 3.05.50 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiczmh4orexqbiafeecq2366glb5hqwtdhjqsr3w4sxtdj2mruudbm)\n \n## Steps to Implementation\n\nThe primary step to implementation would be the delegation and grant of ARB to the EventHorizonArbitrum.eth SAFE. After initial delegation from the DAO Event Horizon handles everything from there. Event Horizon will facilitate and maintain all elements of the pool from pass minting to metagovernance. \n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nThe Arbitrum Event Horizon Oversight Committee: A committee of 5 existing, notable delegates will be voted on by the Arbitrum community to be given the ability to guide the Event Horizon voting pool on matters of Arbitrum metagovernance. A simple 3/5 majority would allow this committee to veto the decisions of the voter pool within the 24 hours between the closing of the Event Horizon proposal, and the underlying DAO’s proposal.\n\nWe also partnered with Gitcoin to add Gitcoin Passport requirements shortly after initial delegation to mitigate sybil risk.",

        "body": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power \n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay \n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1) The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n2. The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n\nIncreasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n\nOn the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n2) The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n\n3) The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 6 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n**RFC -** January 11th to January 18th\n\n**Snapshot -** January 18th to January 25th\n\n**On-Chain Vote:** January 30th to February 13th\n\n**Execution Delay:**\n\n- February 13th to February 16th - L2 Waiting Period\n- February 16th to February 23rd - L2-to-L1 Message\n- February 23rd to February 27th - L1 Waiting Period\n\n**Please note the aforementioned timeline is tentative and the actual timeline might be slightly different.**",

        "body": "# Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO’s Operations\n\n#### Non Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce guidelines for posting proposals to a vote; primarily to reduce delegate fatigue by ensuring that Snapshot and Tally votes are posted at a regular cadence with greater predictability. Rather than formally updating the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, the chosen guidelines can be seen as a common social agreement between delegates. This proposal carries no cost to the DAO, and the guidelines can be implemented by the start of August if passed through a Snapshot vote.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince its inception, the Arbitrum DAO has voted on over 280 Snapshots and 30 onchain votes. First anticipated almost a [year](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-1-time-management-in-arbitrumdao-governance/15718) ago by Cattin and Seedlatam, as the operations of the DAO continue to grow, a more efficient and predictable governance process is needed to prevent delegate fatigue.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur team considered several possibilities for structuring Arbitrum DAO’s governance processes. This included creating voting periods organized around a monthly calendar or continuously repeating three week cycles. While both of those structures would greatly increase predictability and allow for the possibility of predetermined rest periods, they each come with tradeoffs:\n\n* Condensing the availability of when a proposal can be posted to a vote creates an incentive to rush proposals. This can be detrimental to overall proposal quality.\n* There is the potential to induce delegate fatigue if there is an overwhelming amount of votes all pushed into one short period.\n  * Limiting the number of votes in each batch opens up further questions on how to prioritize which proposals are included.\n* The DAO has typically [seen](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915) a 14 day application window for RFPs. Ensuring elections begin in a timely manner post RFP is an additional consideration that adds complexity to any designed structure.\n\nPrevious conversations on the DAO’s process have also included introducing [standard guidelines for elections](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915) or an Arbitrum Delegate Code of Conduct. These are topics that Entropy Advisors is beginning to work on as well, but in this case we believe it is better to start by leaning on the side of simplicity.\n\nKnowing that more complex structures can always be implemented later, below we propose the adoption of a set day each week for votes to start as well as a holiday break. Both of these would greatly increase predictability for delegates and can be adopted by the DAO without much of an adjustment period.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThis proposal does not seek to alter the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, but rather create an agreed upon social contract between delegates on best practices in regards to posting proposals to a Snapshot or Tally vote.\n\nOur primary objective is to improve predictability and reduce the potential for delegate fatigue. Based on these priorities below are specifications for the two recommended adjustments to Arbitrum DAO’s governance processes.\n\n### Start all votes on Thursdays\n\nBy starting both Snapshot and Tally votes on Thursday, the DAO can not only increase predictability for delegates, but also prevent the scenario where votes begin/end on weekends.\n\nIn order for a Tally vote to start on Thursday, it must be posted on Monday given the 3-day delay from when a proposal is posted until voting begins. Each batch of proposals ready to move to a Snapshot vote can be scheduled beforehand beginning on Monday and through Wednesday. We encourage delegates to post/schedule votes to begin before Thursday at 12 pm UTC. While not a hard deadline, this will help ensure any votes start for a majority of delegates worldwide.\n\nOverall, this allows delegates who don’t follow discussions as closely a few days to see what will be voted on and properly prepare. Additionally, with multiple opportunities each month to move a proposal forward to a vote, the incentive to rush the process is reduced.\n\n### Holiday Break: December 20 - January 6th\n\nImplement a holiday break to ensure delegates have a break and can return refreshed for the new year. During this time it is advised that no new proposals are posted to the forums and only emergency proposals are put up to a vote.\n\n### Optional: Delegate Approval Process\n\nRecently, we have noticed a trend within Arbitrum DAO of delegates waiting until a proposal makes it to a Snapshot for feedback to be given. This has resulted in some proposals being posted to Snapshot prematurely. We assume this is a result of several factors including the increasing amount of topics delegates must stay up to date on and the fact that there are no specific guidelines on how much discussion is required before moving a proposal forward.\n\nIt would likely be very difficult to achieve DAO wide consensus on what specific requirements should be implemented to determine when a proposal is ready to move to a Snapshot vote. Thus a level of subjectivity is required and taking inspiration from procedures within Optimism DAO, a delegate approval process can be adopted.\n\nThere are currently 64 delegates with greater than 500k in voting power (VP), so our recommended threshold for delegate approval is 4 delegates. Once a proposal obtains this threshold it can be considered that there is consensus among enough delegates that it is ready to move forward.\n\nTo signal their support of a proposal, delegates can post a statement similar to the following: “I am an Arbitrum delegate with xx voting power and believe this proposal is ready to move forward to Snapshot”. Delegates should also link their Tally profile so that it is easy to verify their VP.\n\nThis approach introduces its own set of tradeoffs. While it would likely prevent premature proposals from going to a Snapshot vote, it does increase delegate responsibilities and can risk proposals authored by new contributors getting stuck due to the lack of connections to large delegates. Therefore we are presenting this as an option separate from the aforementioned adoptions and would welcome feedback from the community.\n\nTo help encourage delegates to take on this additional responsibility, as part of the [delegate incentive program](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/) a bonus point can be awarded to delegates on Karma who approve a proposal that eventually passes on Snapshot or Tally. This is just a suggestion and something we will leave to the discretion of the Seed Latam team.\n\n### Additional Considerations: Emergency Proposals\n\nIn the event of an emergency proposal that is time-sensitive in nature we recommend that any adopted guidelines be waived and the proposal be put up to a vote immediately. In our opinion, only Constitutional AIPs that relate to security matters should be considered as emergency proposals.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nAny changes made to the DAO’s procedures need to be widely communicated and accessible for potential new members. Otherwise, there are minimal steps needed to implement other than coordinating delegates and helping the DAO adjust to the adopted changes.\n\nEntropy will also be responsible for:\n\n* Adding the agreed upon guidelines to the [Ground Rules Topic](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/ground-rules/10) so that it is easy for new community members to discover and access. Our team will coordinate with the Foundation to make this happen.\n* Adding the holiday break to the Arbitrum DAO [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).\n\n## Timeline\n\nBelow is a proposed timeline to help ensure a smooth transition and adequate preparation for all delegates and community members.\n\n#### Feedback Period (June 24th - July 11th)\n\nTaking into account GovHack (July 5-7) and EthCC (8-11), we have proposed a longer feedback period so as to not hold a vote when several delegates will be traveling. These events also present an opportunity to gather additional feedback in person.\n\n#### Snapshot: July 11th - 18th\n\n#### Voting Options: Ranked Choice\n\n* FOR: Improving Predictability\n* FOR: Improving Predictability and Delegate Approval Process\n* AGAINST\n* ABSTAIN\n\n#### Preparation Period: July 18th - July 28th\n\nAssuming the proposal passes the Snapshot vote, preparation for the first batch of proposals to align with the new schedule. We recommend that no Snapshot votes are posted after July 21st to help ensure a smooth transition for the first batch to begin August 1st.\n\n#### First Tally Votes Scheduled: July 29th\n\n#### First Batch of Snapshot Votes: August 1st\n\n## Costs\n\nThere are no additional costs to the DAO for implementing this proposal. The primary resources required will be the time required to update and coordinate with delegates on whatever new schedule is decided upon. This will be handled by the Entropy Advisors team.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe wanted to also extend our gratitude to Cattin and the Seed Latam team for providing valuable feedback and assistance with this proposal.",

        "body": "**Abstract**\n\nOn June 12th 2024, the DAO held an election for the role of STEP program manager to oversee ~$30 million diversified into liquid, stable and yield bearing RWAs. Steakhouse Financial won the vote with 60% in favor of their selection, with fees of $174,000 quoted in their application. \n\nThe Tally proposal in April 2024 listed 100k ARB as program management costs, which converted to $86,581 in June-July 2024 by the Arbitrum Foundation. This is insufficient to cover one year of Steakhouse Financials fees. Note: even if the ARB price had gone up, they would not have earned more - all applicant fees were quoted in dollar value and not ARB.\n\nThis proposal seeks input on the right way forward, with the options to\n- Approve only a 6 month contract from available funds\n- Earmark additional funds from yield earned so they complete the one year tenure\n- Not have a program manager, which will result in liquidation of the RWAs\n- Conduct a new RFP to select a program manager for one year at $86,581\n- Abstain\n\n**Motivation** \n\nOn April 10th 2024, the DAO approved 35 million ARB for diversification into RWAs. Of this, 100,000 ARB was budgeted for the role of program manager. The Arbitrum Foundation got an average price of 87 cents per ARB, resulting in $86,581 to pay the program manager.\n\n \n![2024-09-12 23.22.46.jpg](ipfs://bafkreicuaeyplf7wz2ayqzy33iailoxby5zohrg4gngmda4h5q3ja5otei)\n    \n\nIn June 2024, applications for the program manager role opened up where all applicants listed their fees in dollars. Given the funds received from the 100,000 ARB sale ($86,531) are less than the amount necessary to pay the $174,000 listed in Steakhouse Financials application, we need to either shorten their term to 6 months or approve an additional 6 months pay (from yield earned via the program). We can also declare the earlier election null and void while putting out a call for program managers willing to serve at $86,581 for a year. If there is no program manager to oversee investments, assets are liquidated and returned to the DAO.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nWhile writing the Tally proposal, 100k ARB was budgeted for the program manager role based on a sample quotation received from another provider and the prevailing ARB price at the time.\n\nSteakhouse financial and the other applicants prepared their budget in dollar value based on the sample provided instead of in ARB. As a result, the program manager role in the STEP program became under-budgeted and now needs approval from the DAO on provisioning either a shortened tenure of 6 months or additional funding to complete the one year. The additional funds will be requested from the yield earned on the RWAs (estimated at between $1-2 million per year) to prevent ARB liquidations. Alternatively, we can hold a new RFP seeking program managers at a fixed price of $86,581 for the year and invalidate the earlier election.\n\n**Specifications**\n\nThe STEP program is one of the largest diversification initiatives at any DAO, seeking to diversify our treasury while simultaneously growing the RWA ecosystem. Given the complications that can arise in managing the large sums of money, it is imperative that the DAO have a capable program manager to recommend liquidations ,conduct firedrills, monitor interest payments to the DAO treasury, and track underlying changes in service providers.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n\nAfter ratification of Steakhouse Financials role as STEP program manager and whether it is 6 months or 1 year, the Arbitrum foundation will sign an agreement with Steakhouse Financial and begin investments into selected RWA providers.\n\n**Timeline**\n\n\nPost on forum\n\nUpload on Snapshot (Thursday, 12th September)\n\nFoundation negotiates agreement with Steakhouse and pays the first 6 months of their payment from the initial 100,000 ARB budgeted for in the STEP proposal\n\nAfter RWA yield is returned to the treasury, this proposal is taken to Tally requesting balance of $87,419 (provided one year tenure is approved in the snapshot)\n\n**Overall Cost**\n\nIf the entire one year tenure is ratified, the cost to the DAO is $87,419 paid via yield earned from the program. If 6 month tenure is approved, the cost is needing another election for program manager in a shortened time. If the proposal is rejected, we liquidate all $30 million and return assets to the DAO. If a new RFP is held seeking program manager services for $86,581 for a year, we delay the start of the STEP program and possibly get a less capable pool of applicants at the lower price point.\n\nThere is no budget required for work done on this proposal as it has been paid for through a Thrivecoin ThankArbitrum firestarter grant to the treasury and sustainability working group",

        "author": "0xAbAbE91A907fAdff921720C43ABe4098e7245E99",
        "body": "This proposal has been cut to be posted on Snapshot due to the 10,000 characters limit.\n\nYou can read the full proposal [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496)\n\n### How should I read this proposal?\n\nFirst we present the general parameters and then two options on the proposal feedback (PF) parameter, each option with its own budget.\n\n# General parameters\n\n## Duration\n\nWe’ll extend the duration of the program to twelve months.\n\n**ArbitrumDAO may cancel the program or modify parameters, such as scoring methodology, through an instantaneous snapshot vote.**\n\n## Requirements to Participate in the DIP\n\nThe requirements to participate in the program are as follows:\n\n- **Voting Power:** >50K ARB\n\n- **Change:** This parameter will remain unchanged.\n\n- **Participation Rate (Karma): >60% participation in on-chain votes in the last 90 days.**\n\n- **Change:** Previously, the requirement was 25% of total historical votes.\n\n**Note:** *A new delegate, without prior participation history, must meet the above requirements (>50k voting power and >60% participation in on-chain votes) after a period of 3 months from his first on-chain vote to be eligible for the program.*\n\n- Each delegate must adhere to all social agreements reached through Snapshot.\n\n## Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe will maintain this parameter at 50 delegates.\n\n## Incentive Budget\n\n**Budget Allocation: MAX 4,200,000 USD (up to 7.000 USD per delegate per month).**\n\nWe propose the introduction of three compensation tiers based on the Total Participation Rate achieved by each delegate.\n\n- **Tier 3:** TP between 65% and 70%. Compensation range: $3,000 to $3,250. ARB cap: 8,000.\n\n- **Tier 2:** TP between 70% and 85%. Compensation range: $4,200 to $5,100. ARB cap: 12,000.\n\n- **Tier 1:** TP between 85% and 100%. Compensation range: $5,950 to $7,000. ARB cap: 16,500.\n\n**Note:** *ARB Cap for each Tier **includes a 30% buffer** and will be recalculated on the basis of the ARB price at the time of submitting the proposal for voting in Tally.*\n\n**Note 2:** *We will use the Coingecko rate at the time of payment to determine the value of ARB each month.*\n\n**Payments to delegates are expected to be processed in ARB from the MSS between the 15th and 16th of each month.**\n\n## Conflict resolution\n\n### Dispute\n\nDispute System will be maintained as the original program.\n\n### DIP Ban\n\nYou can see details about this [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-dip-ban-15).\n\n### DIP Suspension\n\nYou can see details about this [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-dip-suspension-16).\n\n## Scoring\n\nTo determine which delegates will receive monthly payments, we will continue using the dashboard developed by Karma.\n\n**Note:** *The program manager may adjust the compensation parameters, provided they inform the DAO of the reasons for the changes.*\n\n### Scoring Weight Changes\n\n**Participation Rate (PR)**\n\n- **Change:** Weight is reduced to 15%, calculated based on the participation rate of the last 90 days in on-chain votes (as calculated by Karma).\n\n**Snapshot Voting (SV)**\n\n- **Change:** from 15% to 20%.\n\n**Communicating Rationale (CR)**\n\n- **Change:** from 25% to 10% (v1.5) or 15% (v1.1)\n\n**Proposal Feedback (PF)**\n\n- **Change:** From 15% to 30% (v.1.5) or 25%(1.1).\n\n**Total Participation (TP)**\n\n- **Change:** from +60% to +65% to receive compensation.\n\n**Bonus Point (BP)**\n\n- **Change:** Adding Bonus Points for delegates attending the “Arbitrum Open Governance Call” and the ‘Bi-weekly Governance Call.”\n\n For both calls, 2.5% BP will be awarded for attendance.\n\n### Delegates’ Feedback Scoring System Options\n\n## Option 1 - Delegates Incentive Program v1.1: Maintain the Current Proposed System With Some Modifications\n\n### Proposal Feedback (PF) Update - Formerly Commenting on Proposals (CP)\n\n* Communicating Rationale (CR): Weight 15%\n\n* Proposal Feedback (PF): Weight 25%\n\n- **100% Weight for Early Stage Feedback (ESF):** Feedback provided until the day a proposal is sent to Snapshot (typically by Thursday at 00:00 UTC) will receive 100% weight.\n\n- **60% Weight for Late Stage Feedback (LSF):** Feedback provided from the start of the voting period to the end of the month (starting Thursday at 00:00 UTC) will receive a 40% reduction in weight.\n\n### Administrative Budget v1.1 (option 1)\n\nWe have updated the operational costs for administering this new program. This payment will be distributed over 12 months and sent regularly along with the payments to the delegates.\n\n**Karma Details:**\n\n- $5800/month * 12 = $69,600 for continuing to build and enhance the dashboard.\n\n**SEEDGov Details:**\n\n- 2 Program Administrators (1 Part-Time - 1 Full-time): $117,000 over 12 months.\n\n- 1 Data Analyst (Part-Time): $35,000 over 12 months.\n\n**Total:** $152,000 ($12,667 per month)\n\n## Budget Summary\n\n- USD 4,200,000 in Incentives. Delegates' compensation is capped at 16,500 ARB per delegate per month (Tier 1), which means the maximum spending on incentives would be 9,900,000 ARB per year (16,500 ARB x 50 delegates x 12 months). The ARB cap already includes a 30% buffer, and it will be recalculated before Tally.\n\n- USD 69,600 +30% ARB buffer for Dashboard maintenance and upgrade\n\n- USD 152,000 +30% ARB buffer for Operational Costs/Program Administration.\n\n**Total:** USD 4,421,600\n\n**Note:** *USD costs are fixed, meaning that if the price of ARB increases, the USD costs will remain the same. At the end of the program, any remaining ARB tokens from the program will be returned to the treasury.*\n\n**Note 2:** *Any remaining funds from the experimental incentive program multisig will sent back to the treasury.*\n\n**Note 3:** *Final amounts in ARB will be recalculated on the basis of the ARB price at the time of submitting the proposal for voting in Tally.*\n\n**Note 4:** *The funds will be sent to the recently approved* MSS.\n\n**Note 5:** *If the program exceeds 65 participants (which is the number that we believe we could cover with the budget requested) we will reopen discussions in the forum on the budget, also considering the possibility of increasing the number of delegates incentivized.*\n\n## Option 2 - Introducing Delegates Incentive Program v1.5: a New Evaluation System for Delegates’ Feedback\n\nInstead of counting comments on proposals that reach Snapshot, we propose implementing a monthly analysis of the feedback provided by delegates, regardless of whether the proposal/discussion has reached Snapshot.\n\nIn this way, the Program Administrator would be responsible for creating a rubric that evaluates the value and timeliness of the feedback provided by delegates. \n\n***Note: in this option the weight of Communicating Rationale (CR) is 10% and for Delegates’ Feedback is 30% instead of 15% and 25% like in the proposed V1.1.***\n\n### Evaluation Approach\n\nThis rubric assesses the overall feedback provided by the delegate throughout the month (from day 1 at 00:00 UTC to the last day of the month at 23:59:59 UTC), based on a summary of their participation in various proposals and discussions.\n\n* Key point: Feedback or opinions that violate community rules will not be considered.\n\n### Rubric Specifications\n\nThe parameter “Proposal Feedback” should be renamed to \"Delegate’s Feedback” in this case since we’re analyzing the overall feedback provided by the delegate (not just proposals on snapshot) and will maintain a maximum weight of 30%, the score will be awarded based on the following rubric:\n\n![|602x471](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfMR0vvihktjB6t-iKq9OgMUxMwgEhD4SqI7hWb0rlKUkkCSHMfvlWEgHL4gvFTzpoJ07_FNqVRkXzPKw9PkbFXGXLrv66FqH1PIImG-H2nShlp7EzTWd9V9BgU_gq9-lUVKgp9ryuSLgedYx1-djIwkng?key=z0llyoBlBsbRIxKCLzkjNQ)\n\n### Monthly Evaluation Process\n\n**1. Data Collection**\n\n**2. Overall Evaluation**\n\n**3. Score Assignment**\n\n**4. Monthly Report**\n\n### Scoring Methodology\n\nEach rubric criterion has levels with an assigned score, from 1 to 4, depending on the level achieved.\n\nThe initial score is obtained by adding the first five criteria, while the final score results from applying the “Presence in Discussions” multiplier to the initial score. The maximum Initial Score is 20 points and 30 points for the Final Score.\n\nAlso if v1.5 is chosen, this scoring system will be in a testing phase, and we, as Administrators, commit to submitting it to the DAO for consultation after three months of running the program.\n\n### Administrative Budget v1.5 (option 2)\n\nThis option changes the responsibilities and budget of the Program Administrators. It requires more human resources to expand the Delegate’s Feedback analysis and additional time and resources to develop and train the AI for automation.\n\nNew budget details:\n\n* On the Program Administrator side: $16,000/month - $192,000/year (2 program administrators, both full-time instead of 1 part-time and 1 full-time + 1 data analyst part-time)\n\n* On the Dashboard and Tools provider side: $7250/month - $87,000/year\n\n* Total administrative budget: $279,000/year (6,6% of the delegates’ incentives budget)\n\n## Management and development of the Delegate Incentives Program: Responsibilities and Deliverables\n\nThe SEEDGov team and Karma will continue to collaborate to maintain and manage this new version of the DIP.\n\n### Program Dashboard Management (Karma)\n\nSee the responsibilities breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-dashboard-management-karma-35).\n\n### Program Manager (SEEDGov)\n\nSee the responsibilities breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-manager-seedgov-36).\n\n## KPIs\n\nSee the KPIs breakdown [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-delegate-incentive-program-dip/26496#p-57276-program-manager-seedgov-36).",
