This quarter’s focus will be to find, fund and launch projects with Balancer V3 ahead of its launch in Q2 and help boost wide adoption.\n\nThe grants committee has completed a historic assessment of the grants awarded since its inception in August 2021. This proposal is created on the basis of the findings and recommendations of [this report](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458).\n\n* Funding duration 3 months from Jan 1st to March 31st, 2024.\n* Funding for new grantees - 50k BAL\n* Separate budget for “Moonshot projects” (research topics, novel projects that are interesting but use case is unknown. Described more below ) - 15k BAL\n* Funding categories identified in Program Recap\n* Attract more projects to build on V3\n* Reinstate Committee Lead to $8k USDC/month and allowance for 1 of each committee comp tier.\n* End long running grants (RealEstate Exchange, GammaSwap and Yearn) recovering funds for future projects\n\nWith the recovery of funds from stale grants and an increase in BAL price, no BAL is required for funding period. Funding is requested to top up the grants treasury to:\n\n1. 64,671 BAL available for new grantees, 50k general, 15k moonshot *(no additional BAL required)*\n2. 45,300 USDC for committee/support. *(35,300 USDC required)*\n3. 0.5 ETH for gas\n\nAs always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community on how to better develop the Balancer grants program.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nService Provider Name: Balancer Grants\n\nLeader(s): Burns, with committee members John Grant, Mike B, Steve0xp and Zen Dragon.\n\nPledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 (or link to your own): Yes\n\nPledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines: Yes\n\nIn accordance with the Balancer DAO [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1). This will include the Grant’s Committee:\n\n* Developing a monthly report detailing key objective progress which is posted to the Balancer Forum and Medium\n* Attending and presenting during the Baller weekly meeting (mandatory attendance by at least 1 representative)\n\n#### Domain of Operation\n\nAfter 10 waves of funding and a recap over the last quarter, this proposal seeks to continue the grants program as per [BIP-350](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-350-balancer-grants-dao-service-provider-proposal-q3-2023/4915) with increased funding to support the release of Balancer’s V3. The program will continue to offer up to $100K USD in BAL tokens per grant supporting the Balancer Protocol's mission to become a leading DeFi liquidity source, catering to both short-term and one-off projects, as an alternative to the Foundation SP model's focus on long-term and higher-cost engagements.\n\nThe Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below.\n\nFollowing on from the quarter of reflections and [subsequent report and recommendations](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458), the grants program will be focused on:\n\n1. Continue to mentor and deliver with existing grantees\n\nThe program currently has 10 live grantees building assorted integrations, novel use cases for Balancer pools, tooling, analytics and educational resources. These projects total ~$290k of committed funds yet to be paid for outstanding milestones. These can be reviewed on our [Finalized and Live Grants Notion Page.](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9)\n\nDeliverables: On-going support, monthly reports, coordination between Balancer entities.\n\n2. Fund projects dedicated to increasing adoption of Balancer V3\n\nWith Balancer V3 launching in early Q2 2024, grants will play a significant role in incentivising projects to:\n\n* Integrate Balancer V3.\n* Create educational content, tooling and docs to lower barriers to entry for teams building on V3\n* Create new use cases with Balancer custom pools\n* Bounties for highly active community members providing dev support, incentivising integrations for analytics sites etc\n\nDeliverables: Live Grant assessment sheet, monthly reports, weekly meetings\n\n3. Set aside funding for research and moonshot projects\n\nSeparate the funding budget to include a portion of grants that are interesting but may not have a fully formed adoption plan. These are likely to be lower cost with no audit budget and could include:\n\n* Novel research topics or custom pools from teams that may not intend to turn it into a protocol\n* Research optimisation topics for existing infrastructure\n\nDeliverables: Live Grant assessment sheet, monthly reports, weekly meetings\n\n4. Funding categories\n\nAcross these avenues of focus, categories to direct funding are:\n\n|Category|Why / Why not|\n| --- | --- |\n|Analytics|Continuously improving analytics and encouraging existing projects to include Balancer drives volume to the protocol. Clear value.|\n|Custom Pool Types|Custom pool types have the highest potential value to Balancer but are risky. These projects create new use cases and showcase Balancer technology.|\n|Education / Tooling|Very important to make Balancer more user/dev friendly and drive adoption of building and investing in the platform.|\n|Research|Research has been generally avoided after early failed proposals. Recommendation is to revisit funding research as optimizations or new use cases may prove valuable. Risky with low likelihood of payout but high potential payout.|\n|Swap Aggregators|Swap aggregators create more revenue streams. Strategic grants may be considered.|\n|Wrappers / Infrastructure|Can lower barriers to entry for other projects looking to integrate with Balancer and provide additional revenue streams|\n|Yield Aggregators*|Only with a direct value calculation. There are generally sufficient incentives for yield aggregators. With no yield bearing assets, this is not worth funding. If the aggregator has the potential to bring high volume and TVL of yield bearing assets, then a value calculation can be made.|\n\n#### Grants Committee\n\nThe Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. The committee remains an equal democracy with no person having a greater authority on what is approved or not. We rely on individuals’ expertise in different areas to help make informed decisions.\n\nBurns - Committee Coordination Lead\n\nJohn Grant - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nSteve0xp - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nZen Dragon- Committee Member/Mentor\n\nMikeB - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nThe committee has the ability to onboard/offboard members as individual circumstances change throughout the quarter between funding proposals. Given the authority to approve and distribute grant funding, the committee can also self manage members within the approved budget.\n\nThe Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Ecosystem SPs and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.\n\nBy having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.\n\n#### Previous Performance\n\nThe committee has shown that only quality projects will be approved for funding after rigorous assessment. This is evident in the committed spend from the previous quarters. We value BAL above all and will not approve projects simply to meet our allocated budget but on the merits of the project. This quarter (Q4 2023) has been spent assessing the grants to date, outcomes can be found in the report discussed earlier for a deep dive into the programs performance to date. [This report can be read here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458), some data from this is shown below.\n\nTotal application submissions and approvals:\n\n \n![BIP-517-1.png](ipfs://bafkreie5m4yuzqrd7pjzqie25hrno7tsfri4fa4uenudz55dk2dh5iiziy)\n    \n\nStatistics for grant spending to date (since inception in August 2021):\n\n \n![BIP-517-2.png](ipfs://bafkreid2ihhs2i3sxam6boqyfmsb3hridztdnjakjmd2k2fr6tlkoq4xcm)\n    \n\n#### Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown\n\nThis budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants SP for the period January 1st to March 31st, 2024. Unallocated resources will be kept to offset the next budget request if successful. Due to the inconsistent nature of grants and the associated workload, grants team members will self-assess their level of contribution against defined Tiers each month to determine their compensation which is reviewed by the grants committee.\n\nTiers are:\n\nCommittee Lead - $8,000 USD paid in USDC - mentor and provide support/coordination for all grantee teams, administration of grants docs, RFP development, prepare and present monthly reports/community calls, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .\n\nTier 1 Contributor - $600 USD paid in BAL - contribute to weekly grants meeting, grantee support and on-going assessments\n\nTier 2 Contributor - $1,200 USD paid in BAL - As per Tier 1 plus follow up calls for grant applications, mentor at least 1 grantee, RFP development/future grants program planning,.\n\nTier 3 Contributor - $1,800 USD paid in BAL as per Tier 1 plus mentor 2-4 low assistance grantees or 1-2 high assistance grantees or medium involvement further developing grants program.\n\nTier 4 Contributor - $3,000 USD paid in BAL - as per Tier 1 Contributor plus mentor 5+ low assistance grantees or 3+ high assistance grantees or high involvement further developing grants program.\n\n|Expense|Amount in BAL/USD|Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Q1 Grants|64,671 BAL ($244k USD @ $3.75 USD/BAL)|To be rewarded to grantees based on milestones following the full Grants review process. For sub $5k USD contributions a light review process will be utilized. Includes buffer for current approved grants in $USD to be paid in BAL. This will be split with 50k BAL to regular grants and 15k BAL to “Moonshot” projects as described above.|\n|1 Grants lead + 4 committee members|43,800 USDC|The Grants Lead takes ownership of the establishment and operations of the Balancer Grant processes. The lead is responsible for coordinating with Committee Members, scheduling and hosting meetings, maintaining Medium and Notion pages and leading the post grants report. Committee as per tiers. Allowance for one of each contributor Tier per month.|\n|Other Program Expenses|1500 USDC|Any other program expenses that may be required for the smooth execution of the grants program. This may include (but is not limited to) to design, analytics, media, PR, research, legal or any other specialized functions outside the skillset of the committee|\n|Gas Fees|0.5 ETH|For grantee payments|\n|Uncommitted Treasury|64,671 BAL & 10,000 USDC||\n|Total request for Q1|35,300 USDC + 0.5 ETH||\n\n#### Funds to Transfer: 35,300 USDC + 0.5 ETH\n\nThe Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 5) will continue to operate with the remaining funds in the Grants treasury (0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597) carried over and approved to be delegated to the grantees.\n\nImpact on the Treasury: The Treasury currently holds ~3.6M BAL. Funding Balancer Grants for Q1 is at a cost of 1.77% of the treasury’s BAL holdings (this is assuming all 65k BAL is spent on grantees), which annualizes to ~7.09%. The Treasury currently holds ~4.34M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost ~1.04% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~4.18%.\n\nAll transactions will be recorded in a Sheet maintained by the committee and on chain.\n\n#### ETH Address to Receive Funds\n\nGrants Treasury - 0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597\n\nCurrent Treasury Balance ~ 126,419 BAL + 17,000 USDC\n\nCommitted ~ 60,959 BAL + 7,000 USDC (@$3.75 USD/BAL)\n\nUncommitted treasury ~64,671 BAL + 10,000 USDC",

This proposal seeks to continue the grants program as per [BIP-350](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-350-balancer-grants-dao-service-provider-proposal-q3-2023/4915) with reduced funding due to fewer expected applications (extrapolated from recent slow down of good quality applications) and associated management. The program offers up to $100K USD in BAL tokens to projects supporting the Balancer Protocol's mission to become a leading DeFi liquidity source, catering to both short-term and one-off projects, as an alternative to the Foundation SP model's focus on long-term and higher-cost engagements.\n\nThe Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below.\n\nWith this planned slowdown and with the goal to revamp the grants program, we will be focusing on:\n\n1. Continue to mentor and deliver with 12 existing grantees\n\nThe program currently has 12 live grantees building assorted integrations, novel use cases for Balancer pools, tooling, analytics and educational resources. These projects total ~$300k of committed funds yet to be paid for outstanding milestones. These can be reviewed on our [Finalized and Live Grants Notion Page.](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9)\n\nDeliverables: On-going support, monthly reports, coordination between Balancer entities.\n\n2. Fund new, interesting, high impact/low cost projects\n\nWith the 35k BAL requested, we will continue to accept grant proposal for new and interesting tech or tooling to grow the Balancer ecosystem. We aim to fund the following (non-exhaustive list):\n\n* Tooling, calculators, educational resources or documentation improvements\n* Interesting and promising new projects building on Balancer. This will not include yield aggregators, we are determining the requirement and use of a universal adaptor to reduce complexity and dev costs for these teams.\n* Bounties for highly active community members providing dev support, incentivising integrations for analytics sites etc\n* Other high impact, low cost projects for the protocol/ecosystem\n\nDeliverables: Live Grant assessment sheet, monthly reports, weekly meetings\n\n3. Acceptance criteria and performance review of past grantees\n\nWith the program having run since 2021, we want to take this opportunity to look back on the grants awarded to date and assess what has created the most value to the Balancer Ecosystem. This review is to inform changes to the acceptance criteria we use to judge projects as well as direct our focus to valuable concepts for funding. This reporting will require a budget for analytics.\n\nDeliverables: Revised grant assessment criteria, report detailing grant performance to date\n\n4. Aligning grants to Balancer’s latest roadmap\n\nComing into 2024, we want to create a unified roadmap for the Balancer ecosystem that the grants program can use as a guide for funding new projects. While we will stay open to new and novel ideas, it is important to have a known focus that we can communicate to teams for them to tailor applications towards.\n\nDeliverables: Grant program outlook for 2024 presented in funding proposal at the end of Q4.\n\n5. Plan 2024 including a re-look at hackathons and IRL events.\n\nPart of the grants revamp will look at funding hackathons and having a presence at IRL events through 2024.

Given the authority to approve and distribute grant funding, the committee can also self manage members within the approved budget.\n\nThe Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Ecosystem SPs and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.\n\nBy having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.\n\n#### Previous Performance\n\nThe committee has shown that only quality projects will be approved for funding after rigorous assessment. This is evident in the committed spend from the previous quarters.

Funding Balancer Grants for Q4 is at a cost of 0.3% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.22% (although this is a lower funding rate than usual). The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 0.46% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~1.83% (again, lower quarterly cost).\n\nAll transactions will be recorded in a Sheet maintained by the committee and on chain.\n\n#### ETH Address to Receive Funds\n\nGrants Treasury - 0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597\n\nCurrent Treasury Balance ~ 124,069 BAL + 18,500 UDC\n\nCommitted ~ 95,939 BAL + 18,500 USDC (@$3.00 USD/BAL)\n\nUncommitted treasury ~28,130 BAL + 0 USDC",

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/333)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis proposal is to continue Balancer Grants within the Balancer DAO, as an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP). The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. Grants are an alternative pathway for projects aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects up to $100k USD that don’t fit the Foundation Service Provider funding model.\n\nThe current Balancer Grants team has been working together under the previous [snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x398ccb38479bb41ec79a8b2c08e2a5a660aced12aabe4356355966c66603c358) passed on Apr 10, 2023. To date, the grants program has successfully delivered 8 waves of funding and mentoring, expanding the Balancer ecosystem by encouraging building to bring more quality teams into the Balancer ecosystem, increase TVL and build useful tooling for developers, LPs and ecosystem projects. This proposal is to continue the operation of the grants program as per [BIP-229](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-229-fund-balancer-grants-for-q2-2023/4563).\n\nChanges to the previous proposal are:\n\n1. Increase lead (Burns) comp by $1k USDC due to removal of Baller coordinape circle. Note this represents a net reduction of total compensation. Being the most significant compensation we think it is prudent to pay this in USDC due to a healthy stables treasury and BAL hovering around all time lows. Remainder are to be paid in BAL with committee members able to lock or otherwise.\n2. Committee total of 1 lead and 4 members (down from 6).\n- Xeonus opting out due to other commitments as a Baller and Grantee.\n- Departure of JayN from committee during Q2\n\nFinding is requested to top up the treasury (currently 34,404 BAL + 236.61 USDC uncommitted) to 55,000 BAL for future grantees and 4,667 BAL + 25,500 USDC for committee/support.\n\nAs always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community on how to better develop the Balancer grants program.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Grants\n\n**Leader(s):** Burns, with committee members John Grant, Mike B, Steve and Zen Dragon.

This will include the Grant’s Committee:\n\n* Holding an open community call quarterly\n* Developing a monthly report detailing key objective progress which is posted to the Balancer Forum\n* Attending and presenting during the Baller weekly meeting (mandatory attendance by a least 1 representative)\n\n#### Domain of Operation\n\nThe grant program provides support and funding (up to $100K USD, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects.\n\nThe Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below\n\n*Grants Committee*\n\nThe Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. The committee remains an equal democracy with no person having a greater authority on what is approved or not. We rely on individuals’ expertise in different areas to help make informed decisions.\n\nBurns - Committee Coordination Lead\n\nZen Dragon - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nJohn Grant - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nMike B - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nSteve0xp - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nThe committee has the ability to onboard/offboard members as individual circumstances change throughout the quarter between funding proposals.

        "body": "# Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider Proposal Q2 2023\n\n## Overview\n\nThis proposal is to continue Balancer Grants within the Balancer DAO, as an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP). The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. Grants are an alternative pathway for projects aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects up to $100k USD that don’t fit the Foundation Service Provider funding model.\n\nThe current Balancer Grants team has been working together under the previous [snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x8e20d769b9674fbea2f749844525bdddb8afcd874ab8b3aafb17c91a46cf7bca) passed on Jan 9, 2023. To date, the grants program has successfully delivered 7 waves of funding and mentoring, expanding the Balancer ecosystem by encouraging building to increase TVL and bring more quality teams into the Balancer ecosystem. This proposal is to continue the operation of the grants program as per [BIP-76](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-144-fund-balancer-grants-q1-2023/4203/7) and [BIP-144](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-144-fund-balancer-grants-q1-2023/4203).\n\nOnly significant changes to the previous proposal are:\n\n1. Co-lead positions changing to Burns as a single lead due to Zen Dragon’s external commitments. Zen Dragon’s contributions as a co-lead have been invaluable to the grants program’s success to date. Fortunately, he will be remaining on the grants team as a highly valuable committee member.\n2. Addition of Steve0xp in place of ZeKraken. ZeKraken stepped down in Q1 with other commitments and Steve0xp has shown immediate commitment and value to the grants committee over the previous 2 months through knowledge as a smart contract dev and creation/publication of marketing materials. As a long standing committee member with vast Balancer and DeFi knowledge generally, ZeKraken will be a welcome contributor in the future if circumstances change.\n\nDue to rise in BAL price since previous funding proposal, no funds are requested to top up the treasury (currently 65,469 BAL uncommitted) for 55,719 BAL to future grantees and 9,750 BAL for committee/support.\n\nAs always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community on how to better develop the Balancer grants program.\n\n## Previous Performance\n\nManaging between 16-18 live grantees providing cross-functional support between BLabs, Orb and grantees.\nChampioned co-funding arrangements with Aura Grants (Notional and Sturdy)\nTwo TWAMM implementations, one in Beta (longswap.xyz) and a second due to be live next quarter\nNotional Finance adding >$3m TVL from $70k grant. More pools to be launched with Aura co-funding\n\nFunding custom managed pools controller development with novel use cases. (Kassandra, Autonolas)\n\nBringing Yearn’s yBAL into Balancer ecosystem\nFunding development of Xeonus’ analytics site\nExpanding Balancer docs and SDK\nDedication to transparent approvals process and reporting\nRecovered Funds from stale grantees to redistribute to new projects.\n\n## Domain of Operation\n\nThe grant program provides support and funding (up to $100K USD, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects.\n\nThe Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below\n\n## Grants Committee\n\nThe Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. One major change is moving from co-leads to a single lead due to external commitments. With this change, the committee remains an equal democracy. While we rely on individuals expertise in different areas to help make informed decisions, no individual has a greater authority on what is approved or not.\n\nBurns - Committee Coordination Lead\n\nZen Dragon - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nJay Napier - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nJohn Grant - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nMike B - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nSteve0xp - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nXeonus - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nThe committee has the ability to onboard/offboard members as individual circumstances change throughout the quarter between funding proposals. Given the authority to approve and distribute grant funding, the committee can also self manage members within the approved budget.\n\nThe Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Orb Collective and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.\n\nBy having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.\n\n## Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown\n\nThis budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants DAO for the period January 1st, 2023 until March 31st, 2023. At the end of this cycle (March 31st), any unallocated resources will be sent back to the Balancer Treasury or kept to offset the next quarter budget request. A new proposal for the next cycle will be submitted at the end of this cycle.\n\nCompensation will continue to be paid out in BAL to assist the DAO in becoming sustainable from protocol fees. Due to the inconsistent nature of grants and the associated workload, grants team members will self-assess their level of contribution against defined Tiers each month to determine their compensation which is reviewed by the grants co-leads and committee.\n\nTiers are:\n\nCommittee Lead - $7,500 USD paid in BAL - significant administration of grants docs, prepare and present monthly reports/community calls, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .\n\nHigh Level Contributor - $3,500 USD paid in BAL - as per Low Contributor plus mentor 5+ low assistance grantees or 3+ high assistance grantees.\n\nMedium Level Contributor - $2,500 USD paid in BAL - as per Low Contributor plus mentor 2-4 low assistance grantees or 1-2 high assistance grantees.\n\nLow Level Contributor - $1,250 USD paid in BAL - contribute to weekly grants meeting, follow up call for 1-2 grant applications, mentor at least 1 grantee with low level assistance required (generally self-sufficient grantee with no major coordination with BLabs).\n\n|Name|Amount in BAL/USD|Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Q2 Grants|55,719 BAL ($334k USD @ $6.00 USD/BAL)|To be rewarded to grantees based on milestones following the full Grants review process.

        "body": "# Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider Proposal Q1 2023\n\n## Overview\n\nThis proposal is to continue Balancer Grants within the Balancer DAO, as an independent community-owned grants program for the Balancer ecosystem as a Service Provider (SP). The program aims to accelerate the development of the BAL ecosystem while optimizing contributor rewards in the Balancer ecosystem. Grants are an alternative pathway for projects aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects up to $100k USD that don’t fit the Foundation Service Provider funding model.\n\nThe current Balancer Grants team has been working together under the previous [snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xabf95f31233e9b6c9ee22e06d96ffe9e05736acaa091fca8d867d625a6a4a343) passed on Sept 26, 2022. To date, the grants program has successfully delivered 6 waves of funding and mentoring, expanding the Balancer ecosystem by encouraging building to increase TVL and bring more quality teams into the Balancer ecosystem. This proposal is to continue the operation of the grants program as per [BIP-76 ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-76-balancer-grants-budget-proposal-q4-2022/3750), changes to this are outlined below.\n\nRequest is 84,791 BAL total to top up the treasury (currently 16,369 BAL uncommitted) for 70,000 BAL to future grantees, 11,850 BAL for committee/support, 19,310 BAL Fjord Top up (Details below).\n\nAs always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community how to better develop the Balancer grants program.\n\n## Previous Performance\nCurrently managing 18 live grantees providing cross-functional support between BLabs, Orb and grantees.\nChampioned co-funding arrangements with Aura Grants\nTwo TWAMM implementations due to be live next quarter\nNotional Finance adding >$3m TVL from $70k grant. More pools to be launched.\nFunding development of Xeonus' analytics site\nExpanding Balancer docs and SDK\nDedication to transparent approvals process and reporting\nRecovered Funds from stale grantees to redistribute to new projects.\n\n## Domain of Operation\n\nThe grant program provides support and funding (up to $100K USD, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem. While the Foundation SP model is aimed at long term engagements or those with a cost beyond $100k USD, grants are an alternative pathway aimed at funding smaller, short term or one off projects.\n\nThe Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below\n\n## Grants Committee\n\nThe Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds.\n\nBurns - Committee Co-Lead\n\nZen Dragon - Committee Co-Lead\n\nJay Napier - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nJohn Grant - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nMike B - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nXeonus - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nZeKraken - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nThe Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Orb Collective and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.\n\nBy having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.\n\n## Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown\n\nThis budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants DAO for the period January 1st, 2023 until March 31st, 2023. At the end of this cycle (March 31st), any unallocated resources will be sent back to the Balancer Treasury or kept to offset the next epoch budget request. A new proposal for the next cycle will be submitted at the end of this cycle.\n\nCompensation will continue to be paid out in BAL to assist the DAO in becoming sustainable from protocol fees. Due to the inconsistent nature of grants and the associated workload, grants team members will self-assess their level of contribution against defined Tiers each month to determine their compensation which is reviewed by the grants co-leads and committee.\n\nTiers are:\n\nCommittee Lead / Major Contribution - $5,000 USD paid in BAL - significant administration of grants docs, prepare and present monthly reports/community calls, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .\n\nHigh Level Contributor - $3,500 USD paid in BAL - as per Low Contributor plus mentor 5+ low assistance grantees or 3+ high assistance grantees.\n\nMedium Level Contributor - $2,500 USD paid in BAL - as per Low Contributor plus mentor 2-3 low assistance grantees or 1-2 high assistance grantees.\n\nLow Level Contributor - $1,250 USD paid in BAL - contribute to weekly grants meeting, follow up call for 1-2 grant applications, mentor at least 1 grantee with low level assistance required (generally self-sufficient grantee with no major coordination with BLabs).\n\n|Name|Amount in BAL/USD|Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Q1 Grants|70k BAL ($350k USD @ $5.00 USD/BAL)|To be rewarded to grantees based on milestones following the full Grants review process. For sub $5k USD contributions a light review process will be utilized.|\n|2 Grant co-lead|$5k x 2 x 3 months @ $5.00 USD/BAL= 6,000 BAL|The Grants Lead role is split between 2 co-leads. Roles takes ownership of the establishment and operations of the Balancer Grant processes. The co-leads are responsible for coordinating with Committee Members, scheduling and hosting meetings, maintaining Medium and Notion pages and leading the post grants report.|\n|5 committee members|$1.75k average x 5 x 3 months @ $5.00 USD/BAL = 5,250 BAL|Commit to supporting & reviewing up to 10 hours a week and mentoring up to 5 hours a week each month|\n|Fjord Top up|19,310BAL|77k BAL approved and transferred to Grants for a total of $500k USD @ $6.50 USD/BAL. Given the drop in BAL price since approval, the agreement is estimated at a total of 96,310 BAL using a value of $5 USD/BAL for remaining payments. Alternatively, this top up could be paid in February/March once the existing allocation is exhausted.\n|Other Program Expenses|600BAL|Any other program expenses that may be required for the smooth execution of the grants program. This may include (but is not limited to) to design, media, PR, research, legal, gas fees or any other specialized functions outside the skillset of the committee|\n|Uncommitted Treasury|16,369 BAL|Including Fjord overrun\n|Total request for quarter|84,791 BAL||\n\n## Service Provider Pledge\n\nThe Grant DAO service provider agrees to operate under the existing Balancer DAO’s Code of Conduct, as listed [here ](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88)\n\nThe Grant DAO service also pledges to be held accountable by the Balancer Token Holder in accordance with the Balancer DAO [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1). This will include the Grant’s Committee:\n\n* Holding an open community call quarterly and keeping a recording available for 3 months\n* Developing a monthly report detailing key objective progress which is posted to the Balancer Forum\n* Attending and presenting during the internal monthly DAO meeting (mandatory attendance by a least 1 representative)\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, the Grants treasury (0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597) will be sent 84,791 BAL and approved to be delegated to the grantees by the Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 4 out of 7). All transactions will be recorded in a Sheet and summarized at the end of the Grants Cycle.\n\n## ETH Address to Receive Funds\n\nGrants Treasury - 0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597\n\nCurrent Treasury Balance  ~178,807 BAL + 22,078 USDC\n\nCommitted BAL ~162,438 BAL  + 20,000 USDC\n\nUncommitted BAL in treasury ~16,369 BAL + 2,078 USDC",
