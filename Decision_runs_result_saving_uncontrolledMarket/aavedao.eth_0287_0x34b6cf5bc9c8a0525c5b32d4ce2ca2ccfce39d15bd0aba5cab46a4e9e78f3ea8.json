        "author": "0x5d49dBcdd300aECc2C311cFB56593E71c445d60d",
        "body": "## Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is currently contracted to cover V3. We propose to formally expand our scope of work to cover all of Aave, including V2 and GHO. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $1.5M. \n\nWe view this expansion of work as an all-encompassing commitment and, with this, take responsibility for all Aave lending markets and financial products for the remainder of the term. Specifically, this means that there will be no further compensation increase requests, regardless of additional deployments, features, or initiatives prioritized during this time. \n\n## Background\n\nChaos’ initial engagement with Aave, starting in November 2022, focused exclusively on risk management and parameter recommendations across V3 markets ([Discussion link](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025)). In early January, prior to the launch of V3 Ethereum, the community approved a 5-month [extension](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/) of our engagement to cover V2 markets, which expired in early June 2023. Despite coverage and compensation expiring, Chaos Labs has continued to demonstrate unwavering dedication to managing V2 risk and promoting the transition to V3 while allocating significant resources.\n\nFurthermore, we have committed extensive resources to integrate V2 markets into our product suite and put forward comprehensive analyses and proposals. Given that the transition to V3 is a protracted and ongoing commitment, it remains crucial to maintain proactive risk management for V2 in the transition phase. This necessity was underscored in the recent industry-wide deliberation surrounding the CRV market. Chaos formulated a mitigation strategy now being implemented via a series of governance proposals.\n\nAs risk contributors to the protocol, we at Chaos Labs embrace an all-encompassing perspective. We view our domain of accountability and responsibility as the entire spectrum of Aave, including V2, V3 (all deployments), and the most recent launch of GHO,  as they pertain to risk, data science, parameter recommendations, analytics, and more. With this in mind, the amendment to our compensation will more accurately reflect the dedicated resources we allocate, the breadth and depth of our commitment, and the tangible value we provide to Aave. \n\n## **Scope:**\n\nAs outlined in the background section, the scope of our work is expansive, encompassing every element related to market risk throughout the Aave protocol. Below, we highlight the core components of our engagement:\n\n### V2+V3\n\n- **Risk Parameter Optimization** - Deploying our agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors.\n- **Risk Monitoring and Alerting** - We offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations.\n- **Protocol Growth** -  We provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n- **Incident Response and Ongoing Market Impact Analysis -**  We maintain an active role in incident response, ready to react promptly and effectively in the event of any market anomalies or security incidents. Furthermore, we continually analyze the repercussions of market events and potential risk scenarios, empowering us to refine our strategies and bolster the resilience of the Aave protocol.\n- And more\n\n### GHO\n\n- **Parameter Optimization** - Chaos Labs will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.\n- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** Chaos Labs will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO, across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.\n- **Facilitators Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - Chaos Labs will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.\n- And more\n\n## Highlighted previous work and resources\n\n- Products:\n    - [Aave Risk Monitoring and Alerting Platform](https://aave.chaoslabs.xyz/ccar)\n    - [Chaos Labs Asset Protection Tool](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-asset-protection-tool)\n    - [Parameter Recommendations Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations)\n    - [GHO Risk Monitoring Dashboard](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/GHO)\n- Proposals:\n    - [Chaos Labs - Monthly Community Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-monthly-community-update/11174/6) - an overview of all Chaos Labs activity can be found here.\n    - [Ethereum V2 to V3 Migration](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636)\n    - [Chaos Labs V2 to V3 Migration Next Steps](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-v2-to-v3-migration-next-steps/13701/1)\n    - [Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - CRV Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.06.15](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-crv-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-06-15/13709/2)\n    - [Asset and Parameter Recommendations for Aave V3 Ethereum Deployment](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-aave-v3-ethereum-initial-parameters/11159)\n    - [Risk Parameter Updates for MKR - Aave V2 Ethereum](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/174/)\n    - [evaluation of the stablecoin e-Mode category](https://governance.aave.com/t/evaluating-stablecoin-e-mode/12299)\n    - [Risk Parameter Updates - Aave V3 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v3-polygon-2023-04-23/12828)\n    - [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool (AIP 125)](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=125)\n    - [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LTs and LTVs for Long Tail Assets (2022.12.04)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lts-and-ltvs-for-long-tail-assets-2022-12-04/10926)\n- Methodologies:\n    - [Chaos Labs’ Research](https://chaoslabs.xyz/research)\n    - [Chaos Labs - LSD Methodology Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-lsd-methodology-update/12829)\n\n## Terms\n\nWe request an additional $400K for the remainder of our current engagement, bringing the total annual compensation to $1.5M.\n\n\n## Specification:\n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 400,000 aUSDT.

We provide a holistic approach encompassing software and services to mitigate risks in volatile markets, countering economic attacks on the protocol and ensuring the secure preservation of user funds.\n\n## Scope\n\n### **Risk Parameter Optimization**\n\nDeploying our custom agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors. Chaos Labs will thoroughly analyze the ecosystem and build custom agent-based simulations. These simulations leverage protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. Thorough system analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven optimization and risk management recommendations. \n\nCoverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.\n\n**Parameter Recommendation Platform**\n\nThe Chaos Labs Parameter Recommendation Portal is designed to provide the Aave community with a comprehensive understanding of the simulation outputs and underlying data to optimize risk parameter settings. By providing a clear and intuitive interface that highlights the impact of different parameter settings on risk and return, we can foster a more informed and engaged community, facilitating ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing. \n\nIn addition to presenting the data outputs from the Chaos Simulation Engine, the Parameter Recommendation Portal offers users unparalleled access to the underlying simulation mechanics and implications, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the simulations and their results.\n\n### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWe offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health. \n\nAs part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.\n\n### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3\n\nChaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the 'Background' section. \n\nAs we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2. \n\nGiven the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.\n\n### **Protocol Growth**\n\nChaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n\nAs we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol's expansion and sustainability.\n\n### GHO\n\nFollowing the initial launch of GHO, Chaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:\n\n- **Parameter Optimization** - we will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.\n- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.\n- **Facilitator's Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - we will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.\n- **And more**\n\n### Chaos Team Support\n\nAs part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.\n\nOur team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response. In the event of any incidents or issues, our team will be on hand to provide timely and effective incident response, minimizing the potential impact on the protocol and its users.\n\n**Ongoing and Proactive Risk Management**\n\nThis includes detailed analyses of new asset onboarding, assessing the potential risks and benefits of launching in new markets and providing a thorough understanding of parameter recommendations, including qualitative data and position analysis. \n\n**Incident Response**\n\n This includes supporting various events, including liquidity changes, asset depegs, price volatilities, etc. Our team provides ongoing support in these events, including market monitoring and alerting, ad-hoc risk analysis, and recommendations on risk-mitigating actions.\n\nOur team of experts brings a wealth of experience in risk management and data analysis, enabling us to provide the insights and recommendations necessary to navigate even the most challenging market conditions. By working closely with the community, we can provide the support and guidance necessary to promote Aave’s long-term success and sustainability.\n\n## Communications:\n\n- Our team will share our recommendations and analyses through dedicated governance forum discussions, maintaining transparency and facilitating effective communication with the community.\n- We commit to providing a monthly update post, highlighting completed work and outlining our future areas of focus.\n- We are consistently available for community calls and regularly schedule check-up calls with Aave delegates. These calls primarily focus on addressing risk-related inquiries, offering insights into existing proposals, and gathering general feedback.\n\n## Terms\n\n- 12-month engagement, November 13th 2023-November 13th, 2024\n- $1.6M, streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n    - Given community preference, we suggest the full amount to be paid in GHO but are open to any composition of stables/AAVE tokens.\n\n## Specification:\n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (`0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0`) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 1,600,000 aUSDC or GHO for a 12-month duration.\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and Tashi. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, we are targeting a Snapshot vote on November 1st, 2023.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) on November 8th, 2023.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] ACI Service Provider 6-month Proposal\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\nDate: 2023-03-29\n\n## Summary:\nThis ARFC introduces the Aave Chan Initiative Service Provider 6-Month Budget Proposal, following [the successful TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344) via [snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x22eb6c5cdaf3731d4d6e0f4bb179e4cf6fa87470e87323f373f0bb01baceb9af). The proposal aims to allocate funds to the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) treasury for the next six months, enabling us to actively engage in the Aave ecosystem and contribute to its growth and improvement.\n\n## Abstract:\nif this proposal were to be approved by governance, a stream of the allocated budget would be started to the ACI treasury wallet. It will be used to cover various aspects of the ACI's involvement in the Aave community, including team compensation, community engagement, research and development, infrastructure costs & tooling subscriptions, marketing, and communications.\n\n## Motivation:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been a dedicated contributor to the Aave ecosystem. The 6-Month Budget Proposal aims to secure the necessary resources to continue the ACI's work, ensuring that we can maintain our level of commitment and contribution to the Aave ecosystem. For more details about the ACI proposal, please refers to the [TEMP CHECK version of the current proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344)\n\n## Specification:\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with `treasury.aavechan.eth` (0x57ab7ee15cE5ECacB1aB84EE42D5A9d0d8112922) as the recipient. This will allow the ACI to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 250,000 aUSDT.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is an independent organization focused on contributing to the Aave ecosystem. This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Our goal is to deliver continuous risk management and R&D to the DAO. We aim to maintain and improve Aave’s strong risk standards and support Aave’s growth and development with a risk conscious approach.\n\n## Who we are\n\nAllez Labs is a team of data and risk experts with deep experience with Aave and its community since 2019. We have been involved in nearly all risk events that have affected the protocol.\n\n## Allez Labs’ founding members\n\n[Alex BertoG](https://governance.aave.com/u/alex_bertog/summary): Former Risk Lead at Aave Companies, as part of the Genesis team, Alex has been pivotal in establishing and evolving Aave's risk frameworks. Her extensive expertise allowed her to make significant contributions securing Aave's stability and facilitating its growth.

We will achieve this through thoughtful and deep quantitative and qualitative analysis, community engagement and empowerment, and promoting a culture of transparency and collaboration. By integrating these principles into our approach, we envision a future where Aave sets new industry standards for risk management and operational excellence, driving sustainable growth and securing user trust across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## Our Values\n\n**Impactful Contribution:** Allez Labs prioritizes areas where our expertise can significantly enhance the protocol's stability and growth. Through strategic focus and dedicated effort, we believe that our work can lead to substantial improvements, driving Aave towards achieving its full potential in the DeFi landscape. Our roadmap adapts based on the most pressing needs of the DAO, and where we can have the greatest impact.\n\n**Community-Centric Innovation:** Our approach to risk management is deeply rooted in serving the community. We utilize transparent, robust methodologies to deliver risk recommendations that are both effective and intuitive, reflecting the dynamic nature of DeFi markets and the needs of the DAO. Allez Labs is committed to democratizing access to risk insights, offering the community tools and reports that require deep expertise and data to build yet are accessible to the wider community. By focusing on clarity, we will empower the community with the knowledge needed for sound decision-making, thereby contributing to a more resilient and vibrant Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Transparency:** We champion transparency as a pillar of the DeFi ecosystem. By fostering the development and adoption of transparent methodologies, such as open sourcing code and frameworks, we aim to create a culture of mutual growth and innovation. This philosophy is rooted in our belief that progress in the DeFi space is a collective journey, propelled by shared knowledge and collaboration.\n\n**Empowering Autonomy:** Central to our ethos is the goal of minimizing dependency on any single service provider, including ourselves. We envision a future where the Aave DAO is equipped with the knowledge and tools to independently manage risk. To this end, we are dedicated to open-sourcing our data pipelines and models, ensuring that our contributions have a lasting impact and support the DAO's journey towards self-reliance. Our objective is clear: to build a foundation that not only serves immediate needs but also empowers future generations of the Aave community.\n\n## Our approach as a risk provider\n\nOur focus is on providing clear, actionable risk management insights that enhance understanding of the interplay between growth opportunities and potential risks. Through transparent methodologies and open communication, we commit to empowering the Aave DAO with the knowledge needed for informed decision-making, thereby fostering a proactive, risk-aware community.\n\nOur mission is aligned with the evolving priorities of the Aave DAO and its stakeholders. Whether the focus shifts towards GHO, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), or other areas of interest, Allez Labs is dedicated to adapting our resources to meet these needs. By maintaining a flexible approach, we ensure that while we concentrate on the DAO's current priorities, we also keep a vigilant eye on the broader risk landscape. Our goal is to provide targeted, relevant contributions that not only address immediate concerns but also strengthen Aave's resilience and strategic position in the long term.\n\n# Proposal\n\nAllez Labs proposes to partner with Aave DAO, leveraging our extensive experience in risk management and our commitment to open-source principles to enhance the protocol's stability and growth across Aave V3 and GHO. Our mission is to protect Aave from a broad spectrum of risks through employing a holistic strategy that not only focuses on mitigating immediate threats through qualitative and quantitative modeling, but also on embedding long-term risk management solutions into the protocol's design. With a focus on transparency, community engagement, and open-source development, we pledge to empower the Aave community with the knowledge and tools necessary for informed decision-making, fostering a more robust, inclusive, and thriving ecosystem.\n\n## Scope\n\n**Aave V3**\n\n* **Asset Listing Support:** We will provide analysis for new asset listings on all V3 markets for all assets that pass the Temp Check stage.\n* **New Deployment Risk Assessments:** Aave V3 is now active on 10 chains and we anticipate the DAO will vote to explore additional networks in the upcoming year. As such, we will provide market risk and liquidity assessments for new deployment proposals as well as initial assets and parameterizations for these new networks.\n* **Ad Hoc Parameter Recommendations:** Recognizing Chaos Labs' effective and proactive adjustments to market parameters, Allez Labs will offer supplementary analyses and strategic recommendations for V3 market parameters, targeting enhanced ecosystem stability and refined risk management.\n* **LRT Listing Framework:** As Liquid Restaking Tokens become increasingly popular, Allez Labs will create and publish a LRT listing framework with support from the greater Aave community to best onboard and manage these assets within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**GHO**\n\n* **Aave V3 Facilitator Parameterization:** This includes parameter recommendations to manage market and liquidity risks, while ensuring GHO’s competitiveness. Parameters to be tuned are borrow cap, interest rates, and stkAAVE discounts.\n* **GHO Peg Stability:** Our team will develop strategies to minimize peg volatility and drive GHO growth through renewed trust in GHO’s stability, allowing for increased GHO borrow caps. We will work with the GHO Liquidity Committee to supply relevant GHO peg analysis and data.\n* **GSM Parameterization:** Adjust the GHO Stability Module parameters to most effectively support GHO’s peg.\n* **Support Cross-Chain GHO Rollout:** Allez Labs will conduct analyses to assess and mitigate risks associated with the cross-chain expansion of GHO, guided by the initiative and framework set by Aave Labs.\n\n**Protocol**\n\n* **Risk Steward:** Take on the role as the second service provider on the risk steward multistig.\n* **Incident Response:** As needed, when emergency security threats arise, we will provide guidance, threat and impact analyses in order to mitigate the threats.\n* **Automated Risk Management:** We will work with other risk providers and stakeholders to begin development of risk parameter automation strategies to streamline the DAO’s risk process where the trade offs are clear. These may include:\n  * Automation around WETH interest rate parameters which are primarily driven by LST yield\n  * Automation around Supply and Borrow caps for new deployments\n\n### Roadmap\n\n* **Immediate:** Ad hoc risk parameter recommendations for V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and Avalanche markets, support for GHO related items, assume risk stewardship responsibilities, new deployment risk assessments.\n* **Short-Term Objectives (First 3 Months):** Active risk parameter recommendations on GHO and all remaining active V3 markets, support for GSM parameterization and remaining GHO items. Risk analysis work for cross-chain GHO.\n* **Med-Term Objectives (Following 3 Months):** Automated risk management development report, LRT listing framework publication.\n\n### Requested Budget\n\nFor the operations of Allez Labs over a 6-month period a budget of $400,000 is proposed. This budget will enable us to cover operational costs including, but not limited:\n\n* Legal fees\n* Node and data provider subscriptions\n* Cloud costs\n* Salaries, and hiring of additional analysts and developers as needed\n\n### Terms\n\n* 6-month engagement\n* 400,000 GHO streamed linearly throughout the engagement\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\n\nFrom the DAO’s experience with service providers, inspired by BGDs proposal, the following metrics are good measures of performance:\n\n* Monthly recaps of Allez Labs’ contributions to the DAO with tracking of the progress on the scope and various contributions.\n* Provable participation and/or delivery of the projects described in the scope.\n* Direct or indirect participation in projects of other fields of contribution.\n* Feedback from other contributors and DAO members.\n* Direct and transparent engagement with the DAO via this governance forum.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Engage with the community and other service provides to refine the proposal\n2. Escalate the proposal strengthened by stakeholders’ feedback to ARFC\n3. Execution upon approval\n4. Immediate support for GHO, Aave V3 Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism and Avalanche.\n5. Support for all Aave V3 markets along the timeline proposed.\n\n\n\n\n*Copyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)*",

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.
