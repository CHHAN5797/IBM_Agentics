It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nSince the passing of [BIP-55](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-55-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco/3609) and its subsequent extension ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)), Balancer OpCo has been an integral element of the DAO since July 2022. This proposal aims to extend the product development services for an additional 6 months (April 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024). As in the previous proposal, the administrative and operational elements provided by Balancer OpCo are submitted as a separate proposal.\n\nOur primary roles include Frontend Team Lead (Gareth), Frontend Core Engineers (Anastas and Alberto), and Product Designer (Pon). We also contract Ansaf, a long-time community member and experienced frontend developer, on a part-time basis.\n\nThe proposal period has been reduced from 9 months to 6 months to align with other service providers. Balancer OpCo is requesting $373,290 and 15,711.56 BAL for 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\n**Retrospective**\nBalancer OpCo product team was previously funded ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)) for 9 months from July 1, 2023, through to March 31, 2024.\n\nOur high-level goals stated in the previous proposal are as follows:\n\n* Increase LP engagement and satisfaction.\n* Increase veBAL adoption and holder engagement.\n* Increase awareness and adoption of the Balancer protocol.\n\nThese goals have not changed and will continue to guide our focus as we build out v3 of the Balancer canonical app.\n\nBefore shifting focus to v3, our primary focus was to track and improve the general user/LP experience in the v2 app. The KPI we used to do that was the Transaction Flow Error Free Rate, which is fatal errors in transaction flows divided by the total number of successful transactions submitted through the UI. When we started tracking this in July 2023 we were at ~84%. A concentrated effort was made to fix all fixable bugs in those flows and by February 2024 we were able to improve that rate to ~95%. It’s possible with further concentrated effort we could improve that KPI by 1-2%, however, some portion of the remaining 5% are bugs and issues that can be very challenging to resolve, such as wallet errors and specific user network/device issues.\n\nAlthough our focus was generally on improving UX and supporting growth opportunities in the v2 app, very early on in our previous funding period it became clear that we would need to shift focus to a new canonical web application that would support both Balancer v2 and v3 vaults. The reasons behind this are outlined in our [November monthly update](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/opco-product-team-november-2023-update/5417). In November 2023 we publicly put the v2 app into maintenance mode and shifted our focus to the v3 app.\n\nDespite most of our focus being directed towards the v3 application, we have done our best to support growth opportunities in v2 as they arose. An example of this is quickly supporting LRT pools and making them easily findable. We recognise that opportunities for the Balancer ecosystem, like LRTs, are extremely important for the growth of the protocol and we will always do what we can to support marketing and partnership operations through improvements in the UI.\n\nIn September 2023, Tim who was responsible for our backend infrastructure moved on to a new opportunity. Tim had built our v2 API that still serves the v2 frontend application. For v3, we will be using the shared Beets/Balancer API which is managed by Franz at Beets. So we are not looking to hire a replacement and therefore our people costs for this funding cycle are lower.\n\n**Key Objectives and Success Metrics**\nOur key objective for this funding proposal is to launch the v3 web application. The primary motivation for building a v3 app is to build support from the ground up for both v2 and v3 vaults and make the app multi-network native, that is, users will be able to explore and interact with pools across all networks and vaults within the same app. This would have been extremely difficult to do well within the context of the v2 app. This objective also includes a complete rebranding of the Balancer UI/UX.\n\nWe have already made significant progress towards this objective and aim to launch a beta UI by mid-April 2024. Following the beta launch, we will complete support for the v3 vault and launch the UI to the general public alongside the launch of the v3 protocol. The current target for the v3 launch is the end of Q2, 2024.\n\nOur secondary objective is to begin to deprecate the v2 application and its supporting infrastructure. The supporting infrastructure such as the v2 API contributes to our costs and the quicker we can deprecate it the quicker we can lower Balancer OpCo’s 3rd party software costs.\n\nThe success metrics for these objectives are clear, the protocol needs a UI that can support the v2 and v3 vaults, and the UI development should not delay the launch of the v3 protocol. However, our success metrics, besides launching the new app and v3 support, remain essentially the same as with v2. Our focus is on improving the experience and engagement for LPs and veBAL holders. We are already tracking some relevant KPIs (Transaction Flow Error Free Rate & NPS). We will continue to track and report these KPIs as we launch the v3 app.\n\nIn summary, Balancer OpCo’s product team is committed to building a market-leading DApp for the Balancer protocol and supporting growth opportunities through UI development as they arise. The product team are passionate about Balancer and committed to its long-term success.\n\n**Ongoing commitments**\nThe Product Development team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI/UX available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\n* Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\n  * We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to provide liquidity, swap, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n  * We will design, build and maintain the marketing pages for the Balancer protocol. The primary aim of these pages will be to inspire and help onboard potential partners into the ecosystem.\n  * We ensure this UI works across all modern devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n  * We will continually optimize and improve this app so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer introduces in the future.\n  * We will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit, integration and eventually E2E (End to End) tests.\n  * Whenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n  * This also includes responsibility for all copywriting across the app.\n* Ecosystem design support\n  * We will support broader ecosystem design initiatives. For example, we’ll collaborate with marketing on creative direction and occasional asset production.\n* Support the development and maintenance of the shared Beets/Balancer API\n  * The Product Development team currently maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information, as well as a SOR interface that services such as CowSwap use to calculate the best trade routes through Balancer pools.\n  * The existing API mentioned above will be deprecated in favour of the shared Beets/Balancer API at https://api-v3.balancer.fi.\n  * Additional functionality will be added to the shared Beets/Balancer API to support a simpler UI layer for v3.\n* User support\n  * We will monitor relevant channels in Discord, Slack and Github issues for any reported problems and aim to respond within 24 hours and fix the problem as soon as possible.\n* OpCo operations\n  * Manage DNS for all Balancer DAO domains.\n  * Manage user accounts/email addresses under those domains.\n  * Manage 3rd party accounts, upgrades, renegotiations, etc. For example, RPC providers, AWS, and wallet check providers.\n\nGithub repositories that we are directly responsible for:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v3\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v2 (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-api (v2 API, to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/tokenlists\n* https://github.com/balancer/marketing-site (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/metadata\n\nGithub repositories we are not directly responsible for but contribute to:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/docs\n* https://github.com/balancer/backend\n\n**Reporting**\nThe Product Development team is committed to transparency and openness in all our work. The majority of our day-to-day activities can be followed via the previously mentioned repositories. We are also committed to providing higher-level reporting on our work in the relevant calls and on the forum. Our reporting commitments will be as follows:\n\n* Weekly v3 roadmap call\n  * Audience: Internal, engineering and ecosystem leadership.\n  * Here we share status updates on our latest work and take note of any urgent requirements or future work for our team.\n* Monthly forum update\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A high-level written report of work done over the past 30 days, including how that work relates to our stated goals. We will also include reflections on challenges that may be standing in the way of progress on those goals.\n  * Relevant metrics that the Product Development team’s work has a direct impact on.\n* Quarterly community call update (if applicable)\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A higher-level update on the work done over the last quarter and work planned for the next quarter, including KPIs and visual content if relevant. This update will also include reflections on the team and its performance and any changes to the overall direction described in this funding proposal or previous quarterly reports.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget**\nBalancer OpCo product team is requesting 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\nWe request a total budget of $373,290 for the full period. Note that Balancer OpCo holds enough funds to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and other Service Providers vs their original budgets in years 1 and 2. For that reason, no new funding is required from the DAO for this proposal. The table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter.\n![bip-565-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibzvgelwxzehhvztwqftrggjbhvbum4k6rhjj6i5abtoryqhpgoom) \n\nNote that Non-People Costs are reduced in Q2 as we transfer some of those costs into the Balancer OpCo Admin & Ops [supplementary proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628). These costs are for 3rd party services that are used throughout the ecosystem and are critical to the ongoing operation of the DAOs infrastructure. We are referring to these as “Protocol Infrastructure”.\n\nA further breakdown of the Balancer OpCo Product Team costs is shown below:\n![bip-565-1.png](ipfs://bafkreigag7amrn6sougc46ncjc57gyaoioz3o4qgsbyhwsntolcqzsdjei)\n    \n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting an allocation of 15,711.56 BAL for the 6 month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. This BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 2 quarter proposal period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff.\n\n**Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo)**\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the Balancer DAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.",

        "body": "Authoured by: Tristan, Mkflow#7938, Xeonus#4620, Gareth and Tim.\n\n## Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x05d36e7cb6f2f63ac84eb279ff7bb274eb6375a81429edc77655212c79d6d0ae) corporate structure supporting the BalancerDAO, and is intended to serve two primary functions:\n\n### Administrative & Operational\n\nServing as the operating entity with which third-party Service Providers to the BalancerDAO will contract, submit invoices to, and from which they will be paid whether that be in fiat or in tokens. This role is integral to the decentralized operations of the Balancer ecosystem, and in practice has to be in place for the healthy long term functioning of the DAO and the Balancer Protocol. The Balancer OpCo is also intended to host certain ecosystem-wide shared resources.\n\n### Front-End Dev and Engineering Workstream\n\nAs a continuation of the effort to thoughtfully decentralise the Balancer Ecosystem, we are proposing that the Balancer OpCo also house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO in the medium term. The Balancer OpCo will employ or contract the Front-End Development Team that will service the BalancerDAO. The Balancer OpCo will hold the software subscriptions for the necessary UI and marketing tools, and will host the Balancer.fi website.\n\nThe developers identified to fill these roles are drawn from top talent who have a proven track record performing development for the Balancer Ecosystem via Balancer Labs, and are transitioning over to the more decentralised structure of the DAO. They are passionate about the project and committed to its long-term success. The intention is to recruit additional talent to bolster the team, starting with 5 FTEs and moving to 6 FTEs in Q4 of 2022. There is one part-time contractor included in the headcount below. This is the staffing level determined necessary to maintain and improve the quality of the existing Balancer app, and to continue to expand the scope of the app to support the changes and improvements of the Balancer protocol.\n\nWe note for clarity’s sake that this is the proposal mentioned in the [Funding Proposal for the Balancer Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x05d36e7cb6f2f63ac84eb279ff7bb274eb6375a81429edc77655212c79d6d0ae).\n\n## Leader(s):\n\n### Administrative / Operations\n\nThe Balancer OpCo will operate under the direction of the Balancer Foundation, which will oversee / have responsibility for governance, corporate administration and operations. This includes managing software subscriptions and login credentials for the OpCo team and certain ecosystem-wide platforms and social media accounts.\n\n### Technical Lead for the Front-End Development Workstream\n\nBalancer OpCo's front-end development workstream is led by Gareth Fuller (@garethfuller) and by Tim Robinson (@timjrobinson).\n\nGareth joined Balancer in March of 2021 and quickly rose to lead the front-end team and the launch of Balancer's V2 app. He has over 10 years engineering experience and previously worked at Bitbond as a Senior Full-stack Engineer where he was involved in full-feature development for the P2P Bitcoin lending platform. In 2019 he played an integral engineering role in launching Bitbond's STO (Security Token Offering), one of the first in Europe. Gareth has been professionally involved in the crypto industry since early 2017.\n\nTim joined Balancer in September 2021. He has 15 years of development experience in many different languages, teams and locations. He's been involved in the decentralization space since 2017 initially focused on decentralized social media. Prior to that Tim was a senior developer at Cloud 9 IDE which was acquired by Amazon in 2016. At Amazon he worked on AWS Cloud9 and AWS Robomaker for 4 years before jumping full time into web3.\n\n## How the Front-end team will build the gateway to the Balancer Protocol:\n\nThe front-end team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol, as well as providing UI components and software tools for developers to easily build their own UI’s for Balancer related projects. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\n1. Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\n\n* The front-end team is responsible for the main Balancer website and application. We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to invest, trade, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n* We ensure this UI works across all devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n* We will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit and E2E (End to End) tests.\n* We will continually optimize and improve this front-end so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer gains in the future.\n* Whenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n\n2. Maintain API and caching services to retrieve Balancer information\n\n* The front-end team maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information, as well as providing a SOR interface that services such as CowSwap use to calculate the best trade routes through Balancer pools.\n* This API is hosted on AWS using serverless technology, however it will never be a central point of failure as the front-end can always fall back to using on-chain data. It is also completely open source and deployable via a CDK script so anyone can set up their own API service if they wish.\n\n3. Integrate the front-end with other app stores and services\n\n* As wallets and DeFi app-stores (such as Coinbase wallet, Sia Skynet, or the ethOS phone) become a more common way for users to interact with DeFi applications, we will work with providers to ensure Balancer is available in requested and approved locations.\n\n4. Provide tools that allow anyone to self-host the Balancer front-end\n\n* As Balancer is about maximizing decentralization and permissionless-ness, we seek to avoid the front-end being a centralized point of failure or control. As such we provide docker images and documentation for users to run the front-end locally using their own data providers. We will continually maintain these and make them easier to use over time.\n\n5. Provide documentation, resources and help to allow others to implement their own custom UI's for their project\n\n* Many projects integrate with Balancer smart contracts, such as Aave, Element Fi, CopperLaunch, Aura Finance, Olympus DAO, Gyro Protocol and more. Many more are constantly requesting integrations. We provide them with the UI elements and tools they need to be able to quickly create their own custom UI for their application, accelerating Balancer’s growth in the DeFi space.\n\n## How the Front-end team will measure success\n\nThe overarching goal is a world-class experience for Balancer users, which is seamless and always improving. The key metrics that measure this are:\n\n1. Minimal errors reported to Sentry\n2. 99%+ uptime of core features (pools information, investing, trades)\n3. All new Balancer features that require UI support will be available in the UI within 1 month of launch.\n4. At least one new version of the front-end will be released to production each week.\n\n## Front-end Team’s past achievements\n\nThe front-end team has seasoned web-3 qualifications. They built the Balancer Website and Application and all its current functionality from scratch and made it usable with all networks that Balancer has been deployed to. This included:\n\n* Building the Balancer Website, providing an overview of the service.\n* Building the core balancer app, providing the ability to invest, withdraw, trade tokens and claim rewards.\n* Deploying the balancer app on Arbitrum and Polygon chains.\n* Adding integration with Gnosis for gas-free, mev-resistant trades.\n* Building a pool creation UI so users can quickly and easily create their own custom pools of any tokens they like.\n* Building an API service that Cowswap can use for routing trades through balancer pools, and eventually being a caching service to speed up the front-end.\n* Adding the veBAL voting and staking system and all statistics and information related to that.\n* Supporting new core Balancer pool types as they are launched such as Boosted pools.\n* Adding graphs, APR’s and other information that give users a good indication of earning potential with Balancer.\n* Integrating with many new wallets and services such as Coinbase Wallet and Tally Wallet.\n* Providing a docker image and information for users to run their own front end + API service. Adding one-click deploy to Digital Ocean for this image.\n\n## Front-end Team’s future goals:\n\nWe aim to bring Balancer to as many relevant networks and places as possible, make it easier for developers to take UI components to build their own front-ends, and provide better statistics and analytics for our users.\n\n1. Separate the logic from the UI in the front-end, and move the logic to the Balancer SDK\n\n* We’re turning common queries into simple functions and classes in the SDK. This will allow other projects to more easily integrate with Balancer using these functions. Other projects can implement the logic they need using the SDK, and take visual components they need from the front-end.\n* This will allow the front-end team to iterate faster as we can focus purely on the UI and adding new functionality and speed optimizations while the SDK team handles the underlying logic.\n* The front-end team will also be contributing to the Balancer SDK providing improvements, fixes and new features as they are required for the UI.\n\n2. Improve the overall speed and experience of using the Balancer App\n\n* After much of the logic is moved to the SDK we plan to make the API use that same code to constantly load and cache the latest pool and token information, then provide an easy, fast API the front-end can use to load all the information it needs. This should decrease page loading speeds by more than 80%.\n* For maximum decentralization, the front-end will always have a fallback to using the graph + on-chain data in case this API is ever unavailable.\n* We plan to continually refine and optimize the app over time based on user feedback.\n\n3. Maintain and improve the Balancer app’s reliability and security\n\n* We plan to cover the app’s critical functionality with E2E tests.\n* We will continually add to and improve the app’s unit test coverage.\n* We will keep app dependencies as up to date as is reasonably possible.\n\n4. Make Balancer work seamlessly across all chains it supports\n\n* Currently the front-end is deployed to a separate domain for each network. We plan to consolidate all of this to app.balancer.fi and allow for network switching within this app.\n* Along with this rework we plan to make adding a new chain as easy as adding a new config file, so we can support many different Layer 2's and other chains quickly and easily.\n\n5. Provide better statistics and information to users\n\n* We've started improving Balancer APR's and Graphs to provide more information to our users on past investment performance and how much they can expect to earn. We plan to continually add more features and information to make Balancer a more useful investment dashboard.\n* We’re adding support for pools and tokens that generate yield or rebase in different ways, and ensuring all our statistics around them are correct.\n\n6. Support all the new features Balancer Ecosystem creates\n\n* There are some features in the pipeline such as single asset investing and withdrawing into boosted pools, managed pools etc. We will continually add new UI's to support these features and refine them based on user feedback over time.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n## Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nOne year - July 2022 (Q3 FY22) through June 2023 (Q2 FY23) divided into four quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. As per normal, each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be returned to the Balancer Treasury, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal.\n\nWe’re starting in July to account for the set-up and legal fees around the Balancer OpCo structure and compliance fees. It is envisaged that staff will transfer into the OpCo in Q4 2022.\n\n### Requests for USDC transfers:\n\nQ3 FY22 - USDC 62,219 - actual expenses incurred through the end of July 2022 and forecast for August & September June 2022 - immediate payment requested\n\nQ4 FY22 - USDC 418,691 - for transfer 25 September 2022\n\nQ1 FY23 - USDC 464,068 - for transfer 15 December 2022\n\nQ2 FY23 - USDC 533,217 - for transfer 25 March 2022\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nQ3 FY22 - BAL 116,678.08 - for transfer after the snapshot vote, if successful.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n![|624x335](upload://oMyEzVoRf3ueKQQr1VxWVuCQttX.png)\n\n### People Costs - Engineering\n\nPeople Costs are comprised of remuneration and employment costs for the developers. Remuneration is currently denominated in USD, AUD, GBP, and EUR. Exchange rate fluctuations against the US Dollar will impact the actual results. We have built a 5% buffer on FX rates and plan to hedge against this where practical by converting USD or USDC into reserves in those currencies.\n\nThe Front-end Development team is expected to be onboarded in Q4 with five full-time equivalent engineers, looking to hire one more by the end of Q4 and a possible additional team member in Q2 of 2023.

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/335)\n\n# Service Provider Name & Overview\nDespite the dissolution of Orb Collective, the engineers of the Integrations Team desire to continue contributing to the Balancer Ecosystem. We believe that our ongoing involvement within the Ecosystem is critical in driving both the growth and widespread adoption of the Balancer Protocol in alignment with its core mission to be a platform and not a product. As such, we are seeking support and funding to establish a new, independent service provider, to be known as Three Rocks. Our goal is to continue providing valuable partner engineering services as well as continue to work towards refining and enhancing the Developer Experience of building on Balancer.\n\n# Leadership and Team\nOur organization consists of four dedicated and talented engineers: Rab, Bailey, Greg, and Mkflow. We have consciously chosen a lean team structure and focused scope of work, which we believe will allow us to operate with maximum efficiency.\n\nRab previously worked as the Head of Integrations at Orb Collective and will continue to lead the engineering team of Three Rocks. He originally contributed to the Balancer DAO as a community member in May of 2020, and he began working full-time for Balancer Labs in January of 2021.\n\nBailey, while continuing to provide engineering services to the team, will broaden his scope of work by handling all business-related operations. He has been with the team since November of 2022. Prior to his time at Balancer, Bailey spent the previous two years working on both the business and engineering side of a fast growing automation startup.\n\nGreg previously worked as a Senior Integrations Engineer at Orb Collective and will continue contributing to the Three Rocks team in a similar capacity. He originally contributed to the Balancer DAO during V1 as a community member beginning in August of 2020, and he began working full-time for Balancer Labs in March of 2021.\n\nMkflow previously worked as a Solutions Engineer at Orb Collective, and will continue providing engineering services to the integrations team. He began contributing to the Balancer DAO in September of 2021 as a Baller, initially as part of the [opsSubDAO](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66). He later served as a Board member of the [Balancer Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x357877d9d3d121e929f66cad2349987fc658be449585f8d021319b69a3a0e620) and has worked full-time with Orb Collective for the entirety of its first funding year.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the DAO’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88)\nYes\n\n# Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1)\nYes\n\n# Domains of Operation\nOur primary operating domain centers around external integrations. This entails writing and peer reviewing code with strategic partners as well as providing assistance and advice. We also support the ecosystem internally by providing development tooling, contributing to core Balancer work, and advising the Balancer Maxis on technical matters related to DAO operations.\n\n# Key Objectives & Success Metrics\n## The Integrations Life Cycle\nThe integration pipeline can be broken into three primary, chronological stages: **bespoke integrations**, **developer experience**, and **generalized infrastructure**. Each stage is critical in its own right, but it is important to recognize that these stages represent different points in the life cycle of a Balancer product area. As such, the ultimate goal is generalized infrastructure. Once this is established, the given product area self-sustains; integrations are both well understood and trivial to implement.\n\nThe Integrations Team recognizes that generalized infrastructure has historically been overlooked. Throughout the team’s history, we’ve mostly dealt with bespoke integrations, and more recently we’ve pushed focus towards the broader developer experience. We believe it is critical for Balancer’s long-term adoption that we take the final step to generalized infrastructure. We also acknowledge that this cannot be tackled prematurely, and so we describe our full approach below.\n\n### Bespoke Integrations\nIn the early days of a product area (e.g., Boosted Pools, Managed Pools, BPT as Collateral), no singular entity possesses full context as to both how the product works and how it will be used in the wild. Third-party developers lack knowledge of how it works, and the core protocol team lacks insight into its future usage. In this stage, bespoke integrations dominate, and a **hands-on** approach is required from the Integrations Team to bridge the gap.\n\n### Developer Experience\nAs the Integrations Team facilitates more and more bespoke integrations in a given product area, it can start to distill its findings with the goal of enhancing the developer experience. Each subsequent integration should be easier to execute than the last. This stage emphasizes documentation, example code, and possibly additional tooling such as simulations. The approach to partner support becomes progressively more **automated** as the common ground across various integrations starts to take shape.\n\n### Generalized Infrastructure\nAfter a wealth of knowledge is accumulated for a given product area, it is often beneficial to roll out generalized infrastructure to facilitate future integrations. At this stage, the product area is so well understood and its usage patterns so well documented that the generalized form looks obvious in hindsight. Finally, it is time to develop peripheral smart contracts or other tools to approach one-click integrations in the given product area. After this work is completed, the Integrations Team can switch to **hands-off** as third-party developers now have all they need to build their integrations unassisted.\n\nAn example of generalized infrastructure is canonical smart contracts to perform a common task. Consider that each of a dozen third-party teams has developed its own custom BPT oracle to solve the BPT as collateral problem, and all of these implementations display very similar patterns. The Integrations Team is responsible for peer-reviewing each implementation, and so this represents a highly inefficient use of the team’s time and the Balancer Ecosystem’s capital, not to mention the duplication of work across the entire DeFi sphere. It would be better for the Integrations Team to recognize this trend and ship a canonical oracle contract for this purpose.\n\nThe same system can be applied to factories. Consider that a canonical contract already exists, but it is repeatedly deployed with small tweaks to parameters and/or logic each time. If each customization requires a dedicated review, this is highly inefficient. It would be better to craft a factory for this contract which provides the levers necessary for specifying those parameters and/or logic in a safe and self-evident way.\n\n### Examples\nFor illustrative purposes, we present a few known examples of the Integrations Life Cycle in action, some actual and some hypothetical.\n\n| Product Area | Bespoke Integrations | Developer Experience | Generalized Infrastructure |\n| - | - | - | - |\n| Boosted Pools | Bespoke linear pools, peer-reviewed or developed in-house | Documentation and central linear pools repository for external contributions | Coalescence on the ERC-4626 standard |\n| BPT as Collateral | Bespoke oracles, peer-designed and/or peer-reviewed | Documentation and code snippets for developing oracles | BPT oracle contracts or factory, formally audited |\n| LST Stable Pools | Bespoke rate providers, peer-reviewed or developed in-house | Documentation on rate providers, some full contracts available | Rate provider factories: Chainlink, LiquidStaking (used by Coinbase, Binance), LayerZero |\n\n### Conclusions and Goals\nThis life cycle, and its culmination in generalized infrastructure, serves to reduce the error surface of external integrations. Even when thorough documentation is available, the same errors show again and again in third-party code, and the Balancer Ecosystem wastes time and capital on manual support. Generalization also reduces the time, effort, and expertise required to launch an integration, thus amplifying the rate of adoption and further saving time and capital for the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nWe believe that the Integrations Team is uniquely suited to overseeing this pipeline from start to finish given the symbiotic relationship among all three stages and the team’s historical role in the first two. The Integrations Team has always been positioned at the start of the funnel and dealt with a plethora of bespoke integrations but previously lacked a deliberate framework for disseminating its conclusions more broadly and usefully.\n\nWith this framework now in mind, we request autonomy to manage the pipeline effectively, including to decide when a given product area is ready for generalization and how that effort should be prioritized in light of demand from partners. On the flip side, we also commit not to over-budget for any one product area or prematurely escalate to full generalization. We believe these were the key failings of the Managed Pool project last year; we prematurely generalized our solution which led to roadmap delays, and we committed too many of our limited resources towards one product area which didn’t showcase sufficient diversity of demand.\n\n## Vulnerability Response\nOne of the Integrations Team’s key responsibilities in the Ecosystem is to maintain contact with all known partners building on top of the Balancer tech stack. These lines of communication are useful for day-to-day interactions but are particularly critical for vulnerability response.\n\nWhen a core Balancer vulnerability is discovered, such as the read-only reentrancy bug from earlier this year, the Integrations Team must first work with the Balancer Labs Smart Contracts Team to understand the scope of the issue. We then must determine all vectors via which it may impact known partners and discreetly work with partner dev teams to secure their production code. To date, the Integrations Team has helped to secure over $4,000,000 of at-risk funds prior to public disclosure of core vulnerabilities.\n\nIn other cases, a partner project may be exploited and set up a war room in which the Integrations Team participates. We help the partner to determine if the exploit was related to a known or yet-unknown Balancer issue and develop a plan for patching the issue.\n\nIn either case, vulnerability response is a time-critical function that overrides existing priorities. It is expected that these events occur quite rarely but that when they do, all other work is suspended until all known issues are resolved. For safety reasons, it may not always be possible to communicate outwardly when an incident is in progress, and so some trust - that the Integrations Team will take this responsibility seriously and execute efficiently before returning to other work - is required.\n\n## Focus Areas & Goals\nIn summary, we derive the following core responsibilities of the Integrations Team from the philosophy outlined above:\n\n* Bespoke Integrations\n    * Q&A with partners in Telegram\n    * Iterative design with certain high-value partners\n    * Code implementation with highest-value partners\n    * Code review for anything to be deployed and used by the Balancer Ecosystem\n        * Partner projects\n        * Balancer Maxis projects\n        * Balancer Grants projects\n* Developer Experience\n    * Documentation\n    * Code Examples\n    * Tooling and Simulations\n* Generalized Infrastructure\n    * Medium-term smart contract development\n    * Formal audits - funds sourced from the DAO on a case-by-case basis\n* Vulnerability Response\n    * Analysis and investigation with BLabs \n    * Coordination with Partners\n### GitHub Repositories\nIn pursuit of the goals defined above, the Integrations Team is directly responsible for the following GitHub repositories:\n* [Balpy](https://github.com/balancer/balpy)\n* [Linear Pools](https://github.com/orbcollective/linear-pools)\n* [Rate Providers](https://github.com/balancer/metastable-rate-providers)\n* [MPC Examples](https://github.com/orbcollective/mpc-examples)\n\nThe team also contributes to several additional repositories:\n* [Balancer V2 Monorepo](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo)\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/balancer/docs)\n* [SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk)\n* [Scaffold](https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer)\n* Various partner code bases\n\n## Continued Commitments\nFor the past few months, we have continued to execute according to the commitment defined in [our May-July roadmap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-orb-collectives-path-forward-extended-integrations-team-plan/4777). Our goal is to complete all of this work by July 31, and we have already provided an update on our progress for [May](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-may-2023-integrations-update/4852), with another update for June to follow soon after this proposal. In the event that any work is left unfinished at the end of July, we will carry that forward into our next funding period.\n\n## Metrics\nIdentifying and tracking metrics for success has been a struggle for the Integrations Team in the past. We recognize that this is an important aspect of business that helps the DAO make necessary decisions on the effectiveness of a Service Provider. In order to promote this effort, we outline several key metrics that will enable us to track and report on our organizational performance.\n\nThe core on-chain metrics needed to establish a sufficient indicator of Integrations performance are **Total Value Locked (TVL)**, **swap volume**, and **protocol revenue**. Tracking these variables for deployments that are direct results of our contributions will allow us to conduct a time tracking analysis that we expect will help us quantify the **cost/value proposition** of specific types of integrations.\n\nWe plan to utilize Dune Analytics to perform this study by tagging Factories, Pools, Rate Providers and other production contracts to which we contribute. For off-chain tools such as Balpy, we plan to monitor volume by inserting a minimal calldata identifier into each transaction. We hope this allows us to get a better understanding of the value added for partner integrations and uncovers hidden areas of improvement to make the integration process more profitable for the DAO.\n\nAdditionally we plan to produce vulnerability metrics to highlight the **value of funds secured** during exploits.\n\n## Reporting\n### Weekly roadmap sync\nWe will continue to send the team lead to a weekly roadmap sync with other engineering leads and ecosystem leaders. The purpose of this session is to provide internal progress updates, synchronize on strategy, and field incoming requests from other ecosystem participants.\n\n### Monthly forum update\nWe will also continue to provide monthly updates on the governance forum. Though we still intend to use these posts to inform the community on completed work and describe any changes to our internal strategy, we will now focus more on the hard metrics defined above. Our goal is to provide a framework for the DAO to evaluate the team’s performance.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget\nFive months - **August 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023** - divided into two quarters.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories in USDC by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![bip352-1.png](ipfs://bafkreihxbosjk4lnlljmi35t5p4iiu4a2zlf62xvzdxlcvea67ffna6fn4)\n    \n\n## Requests for USDC transfers\n* August 1, 2023: **125,961 USDC**\n* October 1, 2023: **180,211 USDC**\n\n### USDC Budget Breakdown\nPreviously within this proposal, we highlighted the lean structure of our organization and team, which is designed to alleviate any financial pressure on the DAO. This enables us to have a minimalistic financial outline, as shown above.\n\nEach Engineer on our team operates as an independent contractor, a factor that is reflected in the budget by only requiring the organization to handle a contractor’s base pay. Operational costs are kept at a bare minimum and contain insurance, software subscriptions and tax/accounting services. Because this is a new organization, we also have onboarding costs which encapsulate all startup expenses for the company. These expenses include required insurance down payments, company formation/registration and licenses, as well as branding and initial technology costs.\n\nLegal expenses are not included in our budget, as we are also proposing to be granted a seat on the Ecosystem Council as well as reasonable access to legal support and guidance from GRC resources.\n\n## Requests for BAL transfers\n* August 1, 2023: **62,230.58 BAL**\n\n### BAL Budget Breakdown\nIn addition to USDC, the Integrations Team is requesting 62,230.58 BAL to cover commitments made in previous employment packages with Balancer Labs and Orb Collective. These BAL tokens would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4 year vesting basis, with a 1 year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nThe funds will be held in on-chain vesting contracts. These are currently under development, and the source code will be provided at a later date. We are building upon OpenZeppelin’s [VestingWallet](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/874c2d3c02ec1bce6af9a30bc828d3fe2079136b/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol) contract and adding two features:\n* A vesting cliff to respect the existing incentive format.\n* An owner who is distinct from the recipient. The owner has the power to claw back the unvested balance.\n\nThe full amount of BAL tokens will be required up front and used to seed the vesting contracts for each individual contributor. It can be repossessed by the OpCo and returned to the Balancer Treasury upon termination of a contributor’s contract.\n\n## Impact on the Treasury\nThe Treasury currently holds ~4.5M USDC. Funding the Integrations Team for the remainder of FY2023 would cost around ~6.8% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~16%. The 62,230.58 BAL requested in this proposal are currently in possession of Orb Collective and will soon be returned to the Treasury, so the Integrations Team does not require any net new BAL.\n\n# ETH Address to Receive Funds\nThree Rocks wishes to be funded via the OpCo, whose multisig address is:\n**0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693**\n\n# Link to SLA\nThree Rocks will enter into an agreement with the OpCo in the event that this proposal is accepted. At that time, we will edit this post with a link to the agreement for posterity.",

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/334)\n\nAuthored by: @gareth & @Tristan345\n\n# Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nThis proposal deals with the Product Development element housed in the OpCo. The initial discussion is at [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Product should be considered as a part of this proposal. This proposal has been adapted to incorporate feedback from that forum discussion and includes more details around the evolution from Front-end and Design to a more holistic Product model. In particular, a Product Vision section has been added and the Goals section has been updated to align our work more closely with protocol objectives. The proposal period has been reduced from 12 months to 9 months, and the budget has been tightened.\n\nFor reference, the Administrative and Operations element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923).\n\nThe revised proposal for Product seeks approval for 723,525 USDC, compared with 1,139,544 USDC for the previous version. The table below shows the bridge between the previous proposal budget and the revised proposal. Reducing the period to 9 months cut the forecast by 316k USDC down to 824k USDC. This also reduces the BAL request from 38,020.83 BAL to 28,958.33 BAL. We have further trimmed the proposal by 100k USDC to a final figure of 724k USDC.\n\n \n![bip351-1.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvwwaoop35udm3bqga4nnd6vir45n4kfwcymhnwe5t7bw3mxmri)\n    \n\nThe $100k reduction for the 9-month period comprises:\n\n* Dropping the FX buffer for non-USD payroll from 5% to 3%. Note that I have updated the FX rates from the mid buy/sell on xe.com to the rate used by the payroll provider in June, which moves against us slightly.\n* Cutting the allowance for unconfirmed increases in January of up to 5% down to 0%.\n* Cutting the payroll buffer for variances from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working, and hardware to zero.\n* Cutting the budget for TRM API calls of $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.\n\n# Product Development Workstream\n\nThis section has been removed from snapshot to adhere to the max. Character limit. Read about the full details on the forum.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nNine months - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through March 2024 (Q1 FY24) divided into three quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these three quarters. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be available to the DAO, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal.\n\nWe note that the Product team are employees/contractors under OpCo. Should DAO Governance vote to restructure the Product team, for example, change who maintains the front-end or for OpCo to cease hosting the front-end, OpCo policy is to provide staff severance equal to the requirements of local labour law in their jurisdiction, subject to a minimum of one month’s notice.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![bip351-2.png](ipfs://bafkreidscjaz2kkqlxc43hzv2orkewcycoswtzve5p7uxbje2ij5ndxrla)\n    \n\nA breakdown of the Product Dev People costs is here:\n\n \n![bip351-3.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvr76puowmubfmhlobuiegc5m5ponjpckhmmttdcdicqoch5ksi)\n    \n\n### Requests for USDC:\n\nThe OpCo holds funds saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3 FY23. We propose that USDC funding needs for Product be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the nine months of the Product proposal.\n\nQ3 FY23 - USDC 240,744 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ4 FY23 - USDC 241,975 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ1 FY24 - USDC 240,775 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nQ3 FY23 - 28,958.33 BAL - for transfer after the snapshot vote, if successful.\n\n### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe projected spend associated with this proposal can be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb from year 1, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.\n\nFor objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 12.3% of combined current unallocated funds at OpCo, and current DAO Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).\n\n### People Costs - Product\n\nPeople Costs are comprised of remuneration and employment costs for the developers. Remuneration is currently denominated in USD, AUD, GBP, and EUR. Exchange rate fluctuations against the US Dollar will impact the actual results. We have built a 3% buffer on FX rates.\n\nThere is also a buffer to cover small unexpected variances in employment costs. As mentioned, this has been cut from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working and hardware to zero. Any unused amounts will either be rolled into the next funding proposal or returned to the DAO.\n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting 28,958.33 BAL for the nine-month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. These BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 4-year vesting period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff, or return to the DAO Treasury.\n\n### Non-People Costs - Product\n\nNon-People Costs Product consists of software subscriptions to front-end development tools and TRM. These costs have reduced significantly from year one. New additions to the cost structure relate to the design element, proposed to be housed in OpCo from 1 August 2023.\n\nAlchemy is the largest line item at $2,945 per month or $35,340 for the period. The TRM annual subscription runs until May 2024. The annual renewal (est $30k) is outside the period of this proposal and is therefore excluded. In addition, the team is cutting the budget for TRM API calls from $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.\n\nThese and the other software costs depend on certain variables, including, for example, the number of users, log-ins, number of entities in the community that have access, and service calls. Some are billed monthly and others quarterly or annually, hence the changes in costs from one quarter to the next. We have estimated these figures using the best information available as of now, and recognise there will likely be variances during the year as more accurate data becomes available and actual costs become known. The team continues to monitor the usage of these services in order to reduce fees, and where possible negotiate more favourable rates - noting that material negotiations were undertaken in year one that we continue to reap the benefits of.\n\n# ETH Address to Receive BAL:\n\n0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693, a multisig controlled by the Balancer OpCo.\n\n# Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the BalancerDAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.",

This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (July 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a separate proposal. Our primary roles include API team lead (@franzns), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). \n\n@Fernando's recent [post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801) outlines a product vision for Balancer v3, a vision that all technical teams have spent the last six months working to build out. As we approach feature complete and prepare to release the codebase to the wider public, we move steadily closer to bringing v3 to market.\n\nThe following statement from our previous proposal remains as relevant today as it was six months ago:\n> The upcoming release of Balancer v3 presents an opportunity for Balancer to regain narrative and establish ourselves as the platform to empower current and future AMM innovation. We are hugely optimistic in the future of Balancer Protocol and steadfast in our dedication to support the ecosystem to the best of our abilities. As we work towards Balancer v3, it has been inspiring to participate in the development of a more cohesive technology stack to empower the future of the protocol. A technology stack that leverages the collective experiences and expertise of contributors across the ecosystem, avoiding siloed development strategies that lead to unnecessary system complexity in Balancer v2.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broad technical ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. We welcome community feedback.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nAs of January 2024, Three Rocks wound down their operations and all responsibilities transitioned to Balancer Labs under the leadership of John Grant. Despite a reduction in team size, the new integrations team has proven themselves more than capable of stepping up to the challenge. Below is a list of the major initiatives and projects that the integrations team has taken on over the last six months:\n\n- **Rate provider reviews** - @Marcus and @Mkflow27 have successfully introduced a structured internal process to manage rate provider reviews that has created transparency, clear deadlines and improved turnaround time dramatically. The positive impact has been felt across the entire ecosystem.\n- **Aggregator / Solver relations** - The success of Balancer v3 will be tightly coupled to our ability to get v3 liquidity integrated into the broader liquidity landscape. @lipman and John Grant have spent the last several month building bridges to all aggregators and solvers in our network. Getting them early access to the v3 codebase and documentation, and doing whatever they can to ensure that v3 liquidity will have aggregator support from day one.\n- **V3 Docs** - While conducting extensive interviews with partners, documentation was identified as one of the weakest points of Balancer v2. The integrations team, lead by mkflow, has taken ownership over the v3 docs, and has invested significant energy to ensure that v3 will launch with robust documentation, with a focus on easy to use guides for integrators and builders.\n- **Balancer Maths** - A lightweight multi-language repository that will contain invariant implementations for all known Balancer pools. By providing invariant implementations in commonly used programming languages (typescript, python, rust), this repository will serve as a reference point for any teams that require off-chain computation of pool maths (ie: aggregators and solvers).\n- **Scaffold Balancer** - Funded as a grant in partnership with the [BuidlGuidl](https://buidlguidl.com/), Scaffold Balancer will serve as a toolkit for developers looking to build custom AMMs or Hooks on Balancer v3. Based on the popular [scaffold-eth](https://scaffoldeth.io/), Scaffold Balancer provides an interactive UI that allows developers to build, deploy and interact with custom AMMs and hooks. Our goal is for Balancer v3 to become the destination for AMM experimentation and innovation.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nBalancer v3 has been the core focus of the Smart Contracts team for the entire last two quarters, and we are rapidly approaching feature complete. While an exact date has not been set, we expect to release the code base within the next 6 weeks, giving the general public an opportunity to provide feedback prior to freezing the code and starting formal audits. While the v3 development cycle has extended beyond what we had initially planned, the additional time was necessary to iterate on core features until we found an optimal solution.\n\nAs always, it has been a pleasure collaborating closely with @juani, @endymionjkb, @joaobrunoah and Elshan over the last six months. I think I can speak for the entire team when I say that we’re very much looking forward to sharing more details on Balancer v3 over the coming months.\n\n**SDK**\n\nThe new [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) is now feature complete for Balancer v2, with v3 support well underway and on track to be feature complete prior to v3 rollout. In contrast to the existing [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk), the new b-sdk is highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API, allowing the SDK to be focused in its goals. In line with that goal, the Smart Order Router (SOR) has been migrated from the SDK to the API, which can leverage data caching to ensure fresh quotes and fast response times. With the reduction in scope, the SDK team have already become active contributors to the API and will transition into supporting integrations in the mid-term.\n\n**Frontend**\n\nDubbed internally Project Zen, the new Balancer Frontend is undergoing active testing in a [closed beta](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1796274392739274806) prior to a public launch in early July. As a quick recap, the new Balancer Frontend is:\n\n- Multi-chain native to facilitate exploration of liquidity pools across all Balancer supported networks.\n- Statically rendered and API powered to enable blazing fast load times\n- Beautifully designed, adopting the new “Zen” themed rebrand that will be unveiled in the coming weeks.\n- Version agnostic, supporting all v2 pools with v3 support underway.\n- Designed with a flexible architecture, highlighted by it’s ability to easily support v2, v3 and the new CoW AMM pools\n\nLed by @gareth, OpCo and Beethoven X contributors have rebuilt the Balancer App from the ground up, leveraging their extensive Balancer domain knowledge to build a better product that will serve the ecosystem for the coming years.\n\n**Subgraph / Data**\n\nThe development of the v3 subgraph has continued in lock-step with the smart contracts. Led by @mendesfabio, the data team has done a great job of reducing the subgraph’s scope, migrating from a monolithic design that attempted to solve all problems, to a modular design focused primarily on data extraction. This revised approach allows the API to manage data transformation, providing a granular level of control that will result in improved data quality across the ecosystem.\n\nBy separating vault from pools, the modular approach to the v3 subgraph aims to reduce lengthy subgraph redeployments that have been bottlenecks to new pool type development on v2. Rather than redeploying a singular monolithic subgraph, a new pool type will only require the deployment of a pools subgraph that will be significantly lighter weight.\n\nTo support new pool type development by external teams, the data team has developed a CLI tool that will manage much of the scaffolding for developers when looking to include their newly developed pool types to the Balancer Pools Subgraph.\n\nOutside of subgraph development, the data team remains committed to the development of high quality dune dashboard and reusable spells, highlighted by the [Balancer dune org](https://dune.com/balancer) recently passing 1,000 stars. Additionally, the data team has been engaged with external data providers working to ensure the consistency of Balancer data across the broader ecosystem, and has begun engaging with Hypernative (SP) to ensure high quality system monitoring is in place for v3 launch.\n\n**API**\n\nBelow, we present general API updates, written by Beethoven X DAO contributor franz, API team lead:\n\nIn the first half of 2024, our main focus has been on enhancing the API and streamlining processes to meet the needs of the upcoming Zen UI and Balancer V3. We achieved several important milestones during this period.\n\nThe API is now ready to serve the needs of the new UI. We’ve worked closely with OpCo to ensure all their needs are satisfied. We continued to improve the new API on various fronts. For example, we restructured the database to support more historical data, including swaps, liquidity additions and removals, pool snapshots, and token pricing. This allows for more comprehensive data analysis and reporting. The new Smart Order Router has also been fully integrated now and improved order routing efficiency across the platform. Throughout these efforts, maintaining backward compatibility has been a priority to ensure uninterrupted service for existing users.\n\nOptimizing the allow listing process for tokens, pools, and gauges was another significant and important task. We’ve analyzed the current process end-to-end and were able to find several inefficiencies. The implementation of the new process has reduced manual work, making it more efficient and less error-prone for both Balancer Maxis as well as OpCo. This process will continue to be optimized with the new Balancer UI.\n\nAdditional integration efforts included adding support for COWAMM which is a new AMM primitive developed in partnership with Cow Swap. In addition, integration for the new Balancer Vault V3 has started and is progressing alongside the Smart Contract development. We also integrated Mode and Fraxtal to support the launch of Balancer on those networks.\n\nWe also reviewed and fixed the token terminal reporting of revenue for all Balancer chains, ensuring accurate financial reporting. Additionally, we worked with DEX Screener to integrate Balancer Pools properly into their App. Support is not yet live for all chains, but they are in the works.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n- **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting July 1, 2024 and ending December 31, 2024.\n\nWe request to extend the existing budget of $29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",
