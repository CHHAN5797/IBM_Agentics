    "summary": "The proposal requests 750,000 ARB to fund a three-month liquidity incentive program aimed at increasing liquidity on Arbitrum's native and non-native AMMs via Gamma vaults. The vote timeline shows overwhelming early support for the 'For' option. Forum sentiment is largely positive with some calls for more clarity on allocation details. Historical adjacent proposals with similar strong early support also passed successfully, and Gamma's prior grant on Optimism shows effective capital efficiency and good LP returns. Market impact during the vote was mildly negative, likely reflecting external factors unrelated to the proposal. Overall, the proposal aligns well with ecosystem growth objectives and has community backing.",

      "A few comments request clearer KPIs and empirical data on long-term benefits for LPs.",
