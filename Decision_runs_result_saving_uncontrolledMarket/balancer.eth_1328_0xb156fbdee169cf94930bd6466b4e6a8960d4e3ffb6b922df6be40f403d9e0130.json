        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/364)\n\nGauge Proposal Template:\n\n**Summary:**\n> This proposal enables a Balancer gauge for a R/sDAI boosted pool on Ethereum Mainnet. By deploying this new pool, users will be able to borrow $R stablecoin on the Raft protocol and provide liquidity on a R/sDAI boosted stable pool without giving up the whole 3.49% DSR (DAI Savings Rate) accrued on DAI deposited in the DSR module. The deployment of this pool embraces the ongoing expansion of $sDAI, the yield-bearing version of DAI, and eliminates the opportunity cost that current LPs in DAI pools face. A future integration of sDAI as a collateral token in Raft could further strengthen the utilization of such a pool, allowing users to use sDAI to leverage up.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n· Website: [https://raft.fi/ ](https://raft.fi/)\n· Documentation: https://docs.raft.fi/\n· Twitter: https://twitter.com/raft_fi\n· Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/raft-fi)\n· GitHub: [Raft · GitHub](https://github.com/raft-fi/)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Raft is a DeFi protocol that lets you generate $R by depositing liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) as collateral. R is a decentralized USD stablecoin with deep liquidity across many trading pairs and a stable peg. Raft provides a capital-efficient way to borrow while keeping your staking rewards. As more use cases for $R develop, users will be able to spend, swap, and earn with $R. Users will also be able to leverage up to 6x on different LSD tokens in a single atomic transaction.\n \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The R/sDAI boosted pool on Balancer represents the natural evolution of the current R/DAI pool and will allow all Raft users to swap their borrowed $R into $sDAI (or any other asset via multi-step swaps). Users holding $sDAI can earn the DSR yield accrued on the underlying DAI deposited in the DSR module and then use all money markets, DEXs, liquidity pools and vaults, NFT marketplaces, and all other products, on every chain where $sDAI can be bridged.  \n\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** The Raft protocol is governance-minimized. This means nobody controls any key part or mechanism affecting the core protocol functionality. There is no way to pause the smart contracts. The Raft team only has the ability to adjust fees\n\n2. **Oracles:** The pool relies on price feeds from Chainlink and Tellor\n\n3. **Audits:** Raft is audited by Trail of Bits and Hats Finance\n- [ Trail of Bits audit - May 2023](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-04-tempus-raft-securityreview.pdf)\n\n- [ Hats Finance audit competition - May 2023](https://twitter.com/hatsfinance/status/1659263484641660928)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** \n- Liquidations are permissionless (anybody can liquidate)\n- The key parts of Raft protocol are immutable\n- [Liquidity Committee](https://docs.raft.fi/about-r/soft-peg/liquidity-committee) 3 Raft team members. More to be added in the future as the Raft governance evolves\n\n5. **Market History:** Raft was launched on June 5th 2023, and has attracted approx $53m TVL. The Raft team has worked with the Balancer community to launch two successful pools (see $R here, the R/DAI pool on Balancer[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x20a61b948e33879ce7f23e535cc7baa3bc66c5a9000000000000000000000555) and $sDAI[ here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x83f20f44975d03b1b09e64809b757c47f942beea)) we would like to continue being a proponent of Balancer going forward.\n \n6. **Value:** The R/DAI pool deployed on Balancer has been among the top 3 pools on Balancer by trading volume in the last few weeks, gathering $ 42 mln TVL in less than a month. We expect the R/sDAI pool to generate an even higher volume due to the enhanced capital efficiency of holding $sDAI instead of $DAI, which will benefit all LPs and users of Raft.\n\n**Links to pool:** [0xbF2ef8bDC2fC0F3203B3a01778E3ec5009AEEf33](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xBF2EF8BDC2FC0F3203B3A01778E3EC5009AEEF3300000000000000000000058D)\n**Links to gauge:** [0x882f961Def46deadAcf31798B295834a5b6d0c86](https://etherscan.io/address/0x882f961Def46deadAcf31798B295834a5b6d0c86#code)\n\n**Specifications:**\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x882f961Def46deadAcf31798B295834a5b6d0c86`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

We will also bribe to gain votes that reward our pools. These bribes will be paid in SHEZMU tokens. Rewards streaming directly to Aura will be paid in either our token SHEZMU, or in shezUSD. shezUSD is Shezmu’s stablecoin that can be borrowed when depositing whitelisted collateral assets on Oasis. You can read more about Shezmu in the description below.\n\nKey Links\n\nWebsite: https://shezmu.io/\n\nDocs: https://shezmu.gitbook.io/shezmu/\n\ndApp: https://shezmu.io/oasis\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/ShezmuTech\n\nGithub: https://github.com/Shezmu-Team\n\nProtocol Description\n\nShezmu is the first hybrid isolated lending market supporting ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 assets. Cross Chain Router DEX & Pioneer of the supply-elastic NFTfi model. Within our lending market, Oasis, users may deposit whitelisted collateral (USDC, PT-ezETH, wstETH, sUSDe, weETH, BAYC, Pudgy, and Shezmu pharaohs) to borrow shezUSD. This allows for various functionality such as increasing NFT liquidity, looping strategies, and various other yield based functionalities, all in one location.\n\nShezmu’s tokenomics involve an elastic supply NFTfi model. The token itself, SHEZMU, has 0% buy tax and 6% sell tax, with the ability to burn tokens in exchange for NFTs, labeled guardians. Guardians are a one of a kind ERC standard stemming from ERC-1155s, making them the first NFT with emissions that are composable and splittable. This allows for functionality within SHEZMU’s ecosystem, such as being borrowed against within Oasis, but also for dollar cost averaging (DCA) in and out of NFTs with fractionalization, allowing for increased liquidity depth and choices for users.\n\nWithin Shezmu, there is also a platform known as Agora, that issues bonds to thicken liquidity. This pays out users in our options token, oSHEZMU, as well as daily ETH distributions to increase PoL. Additionally, Shezmu has a fiat on ramp powered by Ondefy, and a cross-chain dex powered by Axelar. All of this bundled together allows for a hyper-liquid ecosystem with various in and outs for users to enter and exit with various levels of liquidity.\n\nSpecifications\n\nGovernance: Here is a link to the multi-sig wallet for the owner safe:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xA004e4ceDea8497d6f028463e6756a5e6296bAd3\n\nOracles: https://etherscan.io/address/0x32DF1F85eD7804Cb3d67cF8E1678e48D01B439Ff\n\nAudits: Audit conducted by 0xWeisss through Hyacinth can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1GmeMR4WXA4RmsyeipGhdqWfCLVDkikil/view?usp=sharing\n\nCentralization Vectors: We have a small team (under 15 members), with one lead engineer and 5 developers for front and back end development, but both plans and funds are in place to scale as needed. The treasury is currently controlled by the multi-sig wallet.\n\nMarket History: Shezmu launched on September 8th, 2023. Since then, our community has gained over 1800 holders (NFTs + Tokens) and has gained over $250k in TVL. There have been no major volatility events attached to SHEZMU or shezUSD since launch.\n\nPool: https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xed0df9cd16d806e8a523805e53cf0c56e6db4d1d000000000000000000000687\n\nGauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0xA71Adac76A2e34f8F988Fa6992E3bDAd08D92C01\n\nValue: Our goal is to align the majority yield pool with where most users are providing liquidity. If the Balancer pool gains significant popularity within our community and maintains significant APR values, we are highly inclined to back it as the primary liquidity source.\n\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xA71Adac76A2e34f8F988Fa6992E3bDAd08D92C01`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

We will also bribe Hidden Hand for additional votes to reward our pools.\n\nThe bribes will be paid in wETH.\n\nRewards streamed to Aura will be paid in the form of either our reserve-based utility token, VEC, or in the form of psVEC. psVEC is the yield-boosted version of staked VEC (sVEC) that has been wrapped into a Pod on Peapods Finance to deliver increased rewards.\n\nYou can read more about VEC in our Protocol Description below.\n\n**Key Links**\n\nWebsite: https://www.vectorreserve.com/\n\nDocs: https://vector-reserve.gitbook.io/\n\ndApp: https://www.vectorreserve.com/dapp\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vectorreserve\n\nGithub: https://github.com/vectorreserve\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\nvETH is DeFi’s first Liquidity Position Derivative (LPD), introduced by Vector Reserve.\n\nLPDs, or Liquidity Position Derivatives, are a never-before-seen asset class, capturing the yield from various LSTs and LRTs in a diversified fashion - while maximizing the ways to earn yield from each of them.\n\nvETH can be minted using any approved asset on our dApp, and staked to earn yield from the following sources:\n\n1. Staking and Restaking gains from holding LSTs and LRTs\n\n2. LP fees from pairing these assets on various DEXs\n\n3. Upcoming Superfluid Staking: The process of restaking liquidity positions on EigenLayer to earn additional yield. When this feature of EigenLayer goes live, we aim to be the market leader with a large treasury of LST/LRT-based LP positions backing vETH.\n\nThis approach allows us to generate best-in-market yield, giving vETH holders an advantage over holding standard LSTs or LRTs.\n\nOur reserve-based utility token, VEC, has a symbiotic relationship with the vETH token. While vETH generates value for the Vector Reserve, being a great source of treasury revenue, VEC is emitted to generate liquidity for vETH pairs across multiple DEXs - ensuring the product remains competitive in all areas.

We will also bribe Hidden Hand for additional votes to reward our pools.\n\nThe bribes will be paid in wETH.\n\nRewards streamed to Aura will be paid in the form of either our reserve-based utility token, VEC, or in the form of psVEC. psVEC is the yield-boosted version of staked VEC (sVEC) that has been wrapped into a Pod on Peapods Finance to deliver increased rewards.\n\nYou can read more about VEC in our Protocol Description below.\n\nKey Links\n\nWebsite: https://www.vectorreserve.com/\n\nDocs: https://vector-reserve.gitbook.io/\n\ndApp: https://www.vectorreserve.com/dapp\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vectorreserve\n\nGithub: https://github.com/vectorreserve\n\nProtocol Description\n\nvETH is DeFi’s first Liquidity Position Derivative (LPD), introduced by Vector Reserve.\n\nsvETH is the staked version of vETH, which users receive when they stake their tokens to earn additional rewards.\n\nLPDs, or Liquidity Position Derivatives, are a never-before-seen asset class, capturing the yield from various LSTs and LRTs in a diversified fashion - while maximizing the ways to earn yield from each of them.\n\nvETH can be minted using any approved asset on our dApp, and staked to earn yield from the following sources:\n\n1. Staking and Restaking gains from holding LSTs and LRTs\n\n2. LP fees from pairing these assets on various DEXs\n\n3. Upcoming Superfluid Staking: The process of restaking liquidity positions on EigenLayer to earn additional yield. When this feature of EigenLayer goes live, we aim to be the market leader with a large treasury of LST/LRT-based LP positions backing vETH.\n\nThis approach allows us to generate best-in-market yield, giving vETH holders an advantage over holding standard LSTs or LRTs.\n\nHolders can then stake the vETH on the Vector Reserve dApp to receive svETH and earn additional rewards.\n\nOur reserve-based utility token, VEC, has a symbiotic relationship with the vETH token. While vETH generates value for the Vector Reserve, being a great source of treasury revenue, VEC is emitted to generate liquidity for vETH pairs across multiple DEXs - ensuring the product remains competitive in all areas. Every VEC token is backed by assets within the Vector Reserve, which grow from a share of yield generated by vETH as well as LP positions acquired through bonding.\n\nWith over $30m TVL accumulated across vETH and sVEC since launch, Vector Reserve is pioneering the next stage of the liquid restaking revolution.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Balancer vETH/wstETH gauge will play an important early role in incentivising liquidity providers to help with the process of bootstrapping initial liquidity. It will then serve as an important source of liquidity for svETH on an ongoing basis, supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.\n\nSpecifications\n\nGovernance: Here is a link to the multisig wallet for the owner safe:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xe0EB63B4E18FF1e646ab7E37510E6EaF287AdE3D\n\nOracles: No external oracles.\n\nRate Provider Contract: The rate provider contract for svETH(https://etherscan.io/address/0xad4bFaFAe75ECd3fED5cFad4E4E9847Cd47A1879#readContract) can be seen here. It is currently under review(https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/11) by the Balancer integrations team prior to snapshot voting.\n\nAudits: First audit can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/JacoboLansac/audits/blob/main/solo/vector-reserve.md\n\nSecond audit can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/GeorgeHNTR/portfolio/blob/main/reports/solo/Vector-Reserve-Security-Review.pdf\n\nCentralization Vectors: We have a small engineering team, with one lead engineer, but plans and funds are in place to scale as needed. The treasury is currently controlled by the multisig wallet.\n\nMarket History: Vector Reserve and vETH minting launched along with svETH staking on Thursday 25th January 2024. Since then Vector TVL has rapidly accumulated over $40m in TVL. There have been no major volatility events attached to svETH since launch.\n\nValue: We believe in migrating the majority yield pool to wherever the majority of user provided LP is.

By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Origin Ether users. Origin has already brought over 8,443 rETH and ETH to the Balancer ecosystem and this gauge will encourage Origin to bring more.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n\n\n• Website: https://oeth.com\n• Documentation: https://docs.oeth.com\n• Github: [https://github.com/originprotocol](https://github.com/originprotocol)\n\n• Communities:\n* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/OriginProtocol](https://twitter.com/OriginProtocol)\n* Medium: [https://blog.originprotocol.com/](https://blog.originprotocol.com/)\n* Defillama: [https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-ether](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-ether)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[Origin Ether](https://www.oeth.com/) was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates yield while sitting in your wallet by tapping into blue-chip protocols. OETH is backed 1:1 by ETH, WETH, stETH, rETH, and frxETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is automatically distributed at least once a day through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nOETH yield comes from a combination of:\n\n1. Deploying collateral across various DeFi strategies including Balancer pools\n2. LST validator rewards\n3. A 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the [vault contract](https://app.oeth.com/) (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\n4. By default, OETH sitting in smart contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\n\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding any single LST or farming ETH manually. The current collateral allocation and yield strategies can be seen on-chain at all times via the [OETH analytics page](https://www.oeth.com/analytics). More information on OETH and its mechanics can be found in the [OETH docs](https://docs.oeth.com/).\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nThe Balancer team has deployed the new OETH pool for us, [80OETH/20WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/1/pool/0x7056c8dfa8182859ed0d4fb0ef0886fdf3d2edcf000200000000000000000623), and 50 ETH of liquidity has already been [deposited](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0d82b3357ffee2c3773f690a9fbd0c5c5930507e95e654390d225727d71b0d38). We chose to use an 80/20 pool since Origin is the largest LP and we are holding most of our capital in OETH.\n\nUp to a $13M deposit into the rETH Balancer pool has already [passed ratification](https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0x2ab3fd8727a268e3c0d14d9efa0ea19a2b6916415a47e7f816a5c328474342a9) in the Origin DAO and [has been allocated](https://etherscan.io/address/0x49109629ac1deb03f2e9b2fe2ac4a623e0e7dfdc#tokentxns) to the OETH Balancer strategy - a total deposit of 8,436.84 ETH, now worth over $17M. Two additional Balancer strategies have also already [passed ratification](https://vote.ousd.com/#/proposal/0x6948818628ecb112f8eacd13ea81e3c321464920f6ef34ef75f6e3f43e2cd375) in the DAO.\n\nOrigin has spent over [$8.5M on incentives](https://llama.airforce/#/bribes/rounds) in the Curve/Convex ecosystem and would like to similarly provide incentives to liquidity providers on Balancer. Origin’s Treasury is also holding several million dollars worth of CVX. Origin’s Treasury team is currently evaluating whether or not to make a similar investment in the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Origin Ether is governed by veOGV holders with any upgrades to the contracts being delayed by a 48-hour timelock. More details can be found at https://www.ousd.com/governance and in the [governance section](https://docs.oeth.com/governance/overview) of the OETH docs.\n\n2. **Oracles:** OETH is using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and a dual oracle for frxETH that combines two sources: the Curve frxETH/ETH EMA oracle and the Uniswap frxETH/FRAX TWAP oracle. Please see the [oracle section](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/price-oracles) of the OETH docs for more information.\n\n3. **Audits:** OETH was built reusing 95% of the [OUSD](https://ousd.com/) codebase, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. There have also been several OETH-specific audits. All audits can be seen in the [audits section](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits) of the OETH docs. OpenZeppelin is now on retainer to review 100% of OETH smart contract changes.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** With limited functionality, the [Strategists](https://docs.oeth.com/governance/admin-privileges) are tasked with rebalancing collateral between strategies or pausing deposits. However, a 48-hour timelock enforces a wait period before any changes to the OETH contracts can be executed. The timelock is the owner of our [ERC-20](https://docs.oeth.com/smart-contracts/architecture), [Vault](https://docs.oeth.com/smart-contracts/api/vault), and [Strategies](https://docs.oeth.com/smart-contracts/api/strategies) contracts. OETH currently accepts LSTs issued by Lido, RocketPool, and Frax which each have their own centralization risks.\n\n5. **Market History:** OETH currently has millions in total liquidity across [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit), [Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x52299416c469843f4e0d54688099966a6c7d720f), and [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/pool/0xa51822839bfa4685b27ad60305264a37eae28a68?chain=1).\n\n- Link to pool: [80OETH/20WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/1/pool/0x7056c8dfa8182859ed0d4fb0ef0886fdf3d2edcf000200000000000000000623)\n\n - Link to gauge: [80OETH/20WETH Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c9E55ae29541F2D29cDf83a38F53e1143Db278E)\n\n6. **Value:** The OETH/WETH pool is intended to be a core OETH liquidity pool. Origin has already allocated a portion of its incentives budget to bribe this pool, and Balancer will benefit by attracting additional OETH liquidity.\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth: 0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\n- gauge(address): 0x1c9E55ae29541F2D29cDf83a38F53e1143Db278E\n- gaugeType(string): Ethereum",
