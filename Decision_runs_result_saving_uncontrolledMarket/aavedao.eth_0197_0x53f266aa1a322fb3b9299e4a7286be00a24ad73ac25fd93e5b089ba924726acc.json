        "body": "**Title:** [TEMP CHECK] GHO Stability Module\n**Author:** @AaveCompanies\n**Date:** 19th July 2023\n\n# Summary\n\nThis TEMP CHECK requests approval for the introduction of a Peg Stability Module for GHO (The GHO Stability Module) as referenced in this [Development Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-development-update-testnet-release/11631).\n\n# Motivation\n## Overview\nA Peg Stability Module (PSM) is a contract that enables the seamless conversion of two tokens at a predetermined ratio. This mechanism has proven effective for numerous stablecoin projects, such as MakerDAO in preserving the stability exchange rates. Using this model as inspiration, the proposed Stability Module for GHO leverages the benefits of existing models whilst innovating upon them in several ways to help further  maintain GHO’s peg.\n\n## Features\n\nAs mentioned, the GHO Stability Module (GSM) is influenced by existing designs, with users being able to convert between GHO and governance-accepted stablecoins at a predetermined ratio. However, the design of the GSM also possesses unique features. \n\n***Price Strategies***\nThe GSM introduces the concept of Price Strategies which provide the ability to adjust the pricing ratio between GHO and the exogenous asset, based on different strategies. Pricing strategies oversee the calculation of the price ratio, and:\n- Can be fixed. \n- Can be dynamic, based on price oracles and markets, linear curves, stableswap curves, etc.\n\nFor the initial launch, we recommend implementing a Fixed Pricing Strategy. \n\nHowever, should the DAO choose to transition to a dynamic pricing strategy in the future, this shift can be facilitated through an AIP. The change would involve deploying a new Price Strategy contract and update the GSM to make use of the new Price Strategy. \n\n***The Debt Ceiling***\n\nThe DAO may want to limit exposure to specific assets backing GHO through the GSM. The Debt Ceiling gives the DAO the ability to control the maximum exposure to the exogenous asset.\n\nIf a user tries to mint GHO and the amount of exogenous assets backing the issued GHO is higher than the Debt Ceiling, it reverts.\n\n***The Capital Allocator***\n\nThe Capital Allocator provides a method through which a pre-defined portion of exogenous assets in the GSM can be used by a “fund manager” to allocate and earn yield.\n\nThe amount of funds that can be used is defined through a configurable threshold which is proposed to be decided through a separate governance process.\n\n***Last Resort Liquidations***\n\n In case of a rapid increase in risk in an exogenous asset, the GSM features Last Resort Liquidations to liquidate the exogenous asset. This special contract role allows --  in the worst-case scenarios -- for the DAO to take control of the asset (as a whole), thus pausing the GSM.\n\n***Price Bounds and Swap Freezes***\n\nIn case the price of the exogenous asset deviates from the 1:1 ratio, trading can be stopped using Price Bounds and Swap Freezes. \n\nLast Resort Liquidations, Price Bounds and Swap Freezes are enabled by an external contract granted with a special role that can pause trading. This contract has a function that will look up the price of the exogenous asset, and if it is outside of a certain bound, react accordingly.\n\n# Next Steps\nIf this TEMP CHECK receives community approval at the Snapshot phase, we will:\n1.\tEngage community auditors for a review of the GSM codebase.\n2.\tFollowing the audit, we will share the codebase with the community alongside an ARFC based on the [Facilitator Onboarding Process Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-facilitator-onboarding-process-and-application/12929/)\n\nMoreover, governance will then be able to decide on configurations around many of the GSMs features during the next stage of the governance process. These configurations include but are not limited to:\n-\tInitial Debt Ceilings\n-\tInitial Exogenous Assets\n-\tInitial Pricing Strategy\n-\tDistribution for Capital Allocation\n-\tPrice Bounds for Swap Freezes\n\nOverall, we are excited to introduce our vision for the GSM to the DAO and believe it will play a key role in peg maintenance.\n\n\n# Disclaimer\n--\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave V3 on Mode \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-23\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nMode is a state-of-the-art, modular L2 blockchain that builds on the Ethereum network via deployment on the OP Superchain. \n\nDeploying Aave on Mode involves setting up a new instance of the Aave protocol on the Mode L2 blockchain, which is positioned to be the DeFi hub of the OP Superchain. This proposal aims to leverage Mode's modular infrastructure tailored for DeFi applications, offering potential enhancements in scalability and interoperability within the ecosystem.\n\n## **Motivation/Background**\n\nMode intends to be the DeFi hub of the Superchain, offering a best-in-class yield experience by attracting cutting edge and innovative DeFi protocols to weave into and build atop of a solid foundation of trusted blue chip favorites, Velodrome, Balancer en route, and (hopefully soon-to-be) Aave.\n\nMode stands apart in its approach to DeFi and liquidity architecture by working closely with stalwart protocols and teams to push integrations and intra-chain operability. By keeping an extremely active presence in the telegram channels and engaging in transformative open dialogue, Mode harnesses the collective wisdom of its builders to design an L2 every DeFi user would be proud to call home. Mode currently has baked-in incentives to help bootstrap early protocols via an ongoing metric based DevDrop which is redistributed to users, as well as Sequencer Fee Sharing, which passes a portion of fees back to the protocols.\n\nSince its Mainnet inception in early 2024, Mode has attracted significant TVL from the BTC L2 ecosystems as well as popular LRTs in the Ethereum AVS sector. Mode has risen into the Top 15 by TVL on DefiLlama, with a current USDC stablecoin dominance. The next priority is supporting more yield bearing assets, both volatile and stable, to enable automated vault strategies, yield markets, and more powerful index synthetics.\n\n### **1. Benefits of deploying to Mode:**\n\n**Scalability**:\n\n- Utilizes Mode's L2 solutions to reduce gas fees and transaction times, enhancing user experience and adoption.\n- Mode has been recognized for having some of the most affordable transaction rates among Layer 2 solutions, which can significantly attract more users to Aave.\n\n**Security**:\n\n- Features a robust multisig management system with oversight from the Mode Security Council, the Optimism Security Council, and the Optimism Foundation.\n- This setup prevents unilateral control over significant changes, providing a secure and stable environment for financial operations.\n- Includes rapid incident response capabilities through a partnership with Optimism, enabling quick technical interventions and smart contract upgrades to maintain system integrity.\n\n**Interoperability**:\n\n- Boasts EVM compatibility and is equipped with LayerZero OFT technology (with upcoming CCIP enablement), facilitating seamless integrations and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem and extending to Bitcoin L2s (like Merlin chain).\n\n**Strategic Significance**:\n\n- Aligns with Mode's modular infrastructure which is optimized for scalability and interoperability, enhancing the overall functionality and reach of Aave.\n- Supports Mode's strategic goals to become the DeFi hub of the Superchain, leveraging its ecosystem to foster significant growth and innovation for both Aave and Mode.\n- Compelling access to BTC synthetics, leveraging Mode’s maturing relationship with Bitcoin Layer 2s.\n- Deploying one of the fastest growing L2s in the space, Mode currently sits within the Top 15 by TVL on DefiLlama.\n\n### **2. Why it makes sense for Aave and Mode to pursue this new deployment.**\n\n**Effects on Liquidity**\n\n- **Increased Asset Pool**: Integration with Mode L2 allows Aave to leverage Mode’s significant m-BTC liquidity and other assets, potentially enhancing the variety and volume in Aave’s lending markets.\n- **Diverse Liquidity Sources**: The presence of synthetic Bitcoin as well as popular LRTs already on Mode broaden the liquidity base, making Aave’s market more versatile.\n\n**User Adoption**\n\n- **Lowered Cost and Enhanced UX**: Mode’s low transaction fees and optimized user interface are likely to attract both existing and new DeFi users to Aave, increasing the protocol’s adoption.\n- **Community Engagement**: Mode’s proactive community outreach and education will aid in effectively onboarding new users to Aave, fostering a deeper understanding and longer-term user retention. Established DeFi players also feel more comfortable depositing in AAVE versus newer protocols, which should spur growth.\n\n**Overall Market Growth**\n\n- **Market Expansion**: Aave’s integration into Mode’s DeFi-centric infrastructure contributes significantly to the broader adoption and growth of the DeFi market on Mode L2, likely to attract fresh capital from other chains who were otherwise waiting for Aave’s deployment.\n- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Mode’s infrastructure supports higher transaction volumes and operational efficiency, a boost for Aave’s scalability and ability to serve more users without compromising on performance.\n\n**Impact on Mode's Liquidity**\n\n- **Enhanced Platform Value**: Aave’s robust lending options add substantial value to Mode’s platform, enhancing overall liquidity and financial activity.\n- **Synergistic Effects**: Aave’s deployment can attract additional protocols and assets that seek to utilize Aave’s liquidity in yield-bearing architecture, thereby enriching Mode’s entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Contribution to Aave's Growth**\n\n- **Strategic Expansion**: Deploying on Mode aligns with Aave’s strategy to innovate within the DeFi space, using Mode’s advanced L2 solutions to access new markets and user bases.\n- **Long-term Benefits**: Integration with Mode’s diverse assets and user-friendly infrastructure is expected to sustain Aave’s growth and presence in the competitive DeFi market.\n\n### **3. Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMode will take several steps in ensuring deep liquidity is deposited to Aave upon deployment.\n\n- Mode will integrate Aave into the Mode dashboard (100,000 daily visits) and points program, which has been a key driver of TVL for Mode applications.\n- Mode will work with existing and new LPs to bootstrap pools.\n- Mode will work with LRT partners to include Aave in ongoing dual incentive campaigns\n- Mode will include Aave in Optimism related incentive campaigns\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nWebsite: https://www.mode.network/\n\nL2 Beat: https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/modeDefiLlama: https://defillama.com/chain/Mode\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Mode and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "# [ARFC] TokenLogic + karpatkey Financial Service Providers - Phase II\n\n---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] TokenLogic + karpatkey - Phase II\nAuthor: TokenLogic karpatkey\nCreated: 2024-07-16\n\n---\n\n![TL + kpk 2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkwva6C80.jpg)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes the continuation of the collaboration with karpatkey and TokenLogic for an additional 6 months, with a proposed budget of 500k GHO. The proposed contributions extend over the three themes detailed below: Treasury Management, GHO adoption and the Aave Stack.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership has created significant value for the Aave DAO across all three focus areas detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/phase-i-summary-karpatkey-tokenlogic/17962). GHO's peg, liquidity, and growth prospects have each improved dramatically over the last 6 months. The DAO's finances are more transparent than ever before and the DAO is firmly positioned for growth.\n\nBuilding on the success of Phase I, we seek to extend our collaboration with the Aave Community for another 6 months. Phase II of our engagement is to focus on enabling GHO and Aave to grow market share through prudent financial management and contributing to numerous growth initiatives. Our three primary focus areas are summarized below:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* GHO Adoption\n* Aave Stack\n\n\n## What to Expect\n\n### Treasury Management\n\n**Asset Management** \n\nThe Aave DAO receives revenue in the form of revenue-generating aTokens for each deployed lending market. Whilst that reduces the need to deploy assets beyond the protocol itself, this creates a need for continual rebalancing of asset holdings.\n\nTo facilitate streamlining routine operational tasks, the [Finance Steward](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570) role, which has been already introduced to the Aave community, will be developed. Given the ability to create allowances, streams, perform transfers, assets bridging, and swaps within pre-approved guidelines and without AIPs, we expect the governance overhead around treasury management to decrease significantly.\n\nThe GHO Finance Steward's capacity to perform swaps will also be improved by the implementation of the [Aave Swap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-swap-upgrade/15311) contract. With this tool, the DAO will be able to acquire assets in a timely and targeted manner, and to support GHO's peg during turbulent market conditions with the ability to create limit orders. \n\n**Financial Security**\n\nA key objective is to define the DAO's annual budget and secure sufficient funds to ensure DAO operations under stressfull market conditions. As the DAO's revenues have exceeded the burn-rate and currently holds more assets (about $145M at [end of June](https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=9&month=6&year=2024&currency=USD)) than planned expenses, this proposal will target to cover a [six months' runway](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/runway) matching holdings with expense tokens or token class as deemed appropriate for capital efficiency. This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Deploying bridging contracts (as required);\n* Bridging Aave funds between networks;\n* Alocating assets for capital efficiency. In particular, migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and\n* Swapping assets to align expenses and holdings.\n\n\n**Aave Analytics**\n\nReporting and analytics functions will be expanded to provide the utmost transparency into the DAO's financial status and overall performance of the protocol, and to support informed decision-making and analysis of the Aave ecosystem. This includes the [Aave Portal](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/) and the [Aave Treasury Report](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), which shows detailed information on DAO holdings and treasury performance.\n\nThe Aave Portal will continue to evolve to showcase the performance of the Aave Protocol and GHO's adoption. Over the next 6 months, the portal will expand to include all revenue sources (incl. Accrued), assets holdings and expenses (incl. budgets) in granular detail, whilst also beginning to include high-level performance tracking across existing covered deployments.\nSeveral legacy community Dune Dashboards will be integrated into the Aave Portal, where they will be maintained and expanded upon over time.\n\n\n### GHO Adoption\n\n**Oversight**\n\nDuring Phase II, GHO's growth is expected to accelerate and expand to several networks. To nurture and maximize the growth potential of GHO, its success hinges on the ability to hold its peg and scale simultaneously.\n\nAs a GHO Steward, we will continue to manage key GHO and GSM configurations, including Borrow Rate, GSM Caps, and GSM fees. As the Treasury Managers, we will ensure the GSM is adequately funded, targetting a collateralization in the range of 5% to 10% of total supply, and that GHO swaps are performed in a manner supportive of retaining a tight peg.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nWe will continue to lead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), overseeing the liquidity growth across different protocols. This includes\n\n* Adjusting liquidity incentives to maintain sufficient market depth;\n* Defining and executing direct liquidity incentives;\n* Leading initiatives that create utility for GHO;\n* Optimizing the utilization of the DAO's strategic voting assets;\n* Supporting GSM Integrations with aggregators;\n* Ensuring GSM are adequately funded;\n* Supporting future D3M, Facilitator, and Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) initiatives; and\n* Support efforts to integrate GHO to Centralized Exchanges, and fund managers.\n\n**Growth**\n\nAs GHO continues to grow beyond Ethereum, our efforts will expand to support those new deployments to ensure adequate liquidity and peg stability is maintained. We will continue to work with teams that build with GHO and advocate for the adoption of GHO wherever practical.\n\nWhen GHO is mature enough to support deploying Protocol Owned Liquidity, we will actively contribute to the creation of sGHO and balancing the needs for sGHO and stkGHO within the Aave ecosystem. \n\n### Aave Stack\n\n**Safety Module Management and Optimisation**\n\nThe Safety Module (SM) currently presents exposure risks due to its reliance on the DAO's native token and its deployment solely on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWith multiple instances of the SM being deployed, we will continue to perform the following:\n\n* Transition from AAVE emissions;\n* Introduce new categories;\n* Amend emission schedules; and,\n* Progressively align protocol exposure with SM holdings; \n\n**Aave Liquidity Network**\n\nWith upcoming changes in the Aave product stack, including the Liquidity Network and the stablecoin's multichain deployment, new challenges will arise in integrating these aspects with other products. We will actively participate in coordination and consulting to support the streamlined and successful deployment of these features.\n\nWhere practical, sunsetting of legacy v2 markets will be supported through continual parameter adjustments to encourage users to migrate to the latest instance of Aave Protocol.\n\n\nBy addressing these challenges, our team aims to support the DAO in achieving sustainable growth and resilience in a rapidly changing environment.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController will be called to create two streams with a start time block 1718673864:\n\n**karpatkey**\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days\nAddress: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\n**TokenLogic**\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses deployment and testings costs.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond the Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave ecosystem. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Onboard New Risk Service Provider\n\n## Author: ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-04-12\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThe current ARFC is set to gather all information regarding potential new Risk Service Provider for Aave DAO and allow governance to choose at ARFC Snapshot stage, which proposal shall move forward to AIP for final consideration as New Risk Service Provider alongside Chaos Labs.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nCurrently there are 3 different proposals for just one Risk Service Provider slot.\n\nAs agreed by community feedback, to optimize ressource allocation, Aave DAO will only have two Risk Service Providers. \n\nCurrently, Chaos Labs is one of the Risk Service Provider, and the other slot will be represented by one of the current 3 teams that submitted different proposals previously in the form of TEMP CHECK.\n\nIt has been also decided to allow one ranked voting ARFC snapshot to allow governance to express their preference.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThere are currently 3 proposals from 3 different Service Risk Providers. All proposals have passed both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK Snapshot stage.\n\n- **LlamaRisk**\n    - [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-llamarisk-as-aave-risk-service-provider/17053)\n    - [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xa55b5d76e615acfc631c150f28774cf2c155908aa715fa35f6ccd9e2a2dfade6)\n- **OpenBlock**\n    - [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-openblock-as-aave-risk-service-provider/17157)\n    - [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xfdd5f215f845ec1733f07997160864af31d6fb5347dc868684476ef42494f0b8)\n- **Allez Labs**\n    - [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-allez-labs-risk-provider-proposal-to-aave-dao/17116)\n    - [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x1ef144485f473c7049f56db0818c09a74ca92d6f67975f5dc620cccd9646e015)\n\nIn order to make easier to decide at ARFC Snapshot, which proposal shall move to AIP for final consideration (and therefore, which Risk Service Provider should be onboarded into Aave DAO),  a table with a summary of each proposal has been made.\n\n| Risk Service Provider | Profile | TEMP CHECK | Proposal’s duration | Desired Budget |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [LlamaRisk](https://www.llamarisk.com/) | Established in 2021 as a service to Curve DAO and its LPs, providing risk transparency analyses of assets listed on Curve, including stablecoins, RWAs (Real World Assets), LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens), and LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens). In 2023, partnered with Prisma Finance to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing LST collateral risk, to produce detailed analyses for onboarding assets onto the protocol. We have since expanded our suite of risk management solutions with agent-based simulations and DeFi strategy management. | https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-llamarisk-as-aave-risk-service-provider/17053 | 6 months | $250,000 |\n| [OpenBlock](https://www.openblocklabs.com/) | OpenBlock is an established provider of economic modeling for leading protocols in the space, including: EigenLayer, Lido, Arbitrum, Solana, Sui, Uniswap, Scroll, Fuel, Linea, Mode, and many others; we have also received a small grant in the past to study incentives on Aave. OpenBlock Labs is based in San Francisco, CA, dedicated to fostering sustainable growth within decentralized protocols through a data-driven platform. | https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-openblock-as-aave-risk-service-provider/17157 | 6 months | $350,000 |\n| [Allez Labs](https://allez.xyz/) | Allez Labs is a team of data and risk experts with deep experience with Aave and its community since 2019. We have been involved in nearly all risk events that have affected the protocol. We are a team of longstanding Aave risk contributors, solicits community feedback for a 6-month engagement with Aave DAO. Our goal is to deliver continuous risk management and R&D to the DAO. We aim to maintain and improve Aave’s strong risk standards and support Aave’s growth and development with a risk conscious approach. | https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-allez-labs-risk-provider-proposal-to-aave-dao/17116 | 6 months | 400,000 GHO |\n\n**As a result, the ARFC Snapshot will have the following voting options:**\n\n**Option A:** Onboard LlamaRisk as Risk Service Provider\n\n**Option B**: Onboard OpenBlock as Risk Service Provider\n\n**Option C**: Onboard Allez Labs as Risk Service Provider\n\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to an AIP vote for final confirmation for desired option as potential New Service Provider.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
