This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nThe below details various proposals reflecting Llama's efforts to date:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n* [ARFC MaticX Polygon v3 Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555)\n* [ARFC MaticX SupplyCap Increase Polygon v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-supplycap-increase-polygon-v3/12217/12)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nThe below chart shows the growth of MaticX supply on both Ethereum and Polygon. The recent spike in Polygon circulating supply is the result of the previous Supply Cap discussion on Aave v3 governance forum and the resulting outreach to various whales. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HzidlG1.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7KgR8XR.png)\n\nThe chart shows a clear growth since 16th February when SD rewards were initiated. There is a clear link between SD emissions on Aave v3 and MaticX growth.\n\nUsing the [Chaos Labs Updated Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-updated-supply-and-borrow-cap-methodology/11602) the MaticX Supply Cap can be increased from 17.2M units to 34.4M units. Doubling of the Supply Cap is acheived by overlooking the limitations of circulating supply and focusing on liquidity which follows the rational of the previous Supply Cap adjustment. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xW01WDf.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iMHRNbO.png)\nRatio exceeds 2.0 and thus, maximum increase in the Supply Cap is 100%.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave's exposure to MaticX over time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters have been proposed by Llama for the community to review and discuss in the comments section.\n\nTicker: MaticX\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0xfa68FB4628DFF1028CFEc22b4162FCcd0d45efb6`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6)\n\nOption 1 - 19.6M Supply Cap\nOption 2 - 29.3M Supply Cap\nOption 3 - NAE\nOption 4 - ABSTAIN\n\nOption 1 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\nOption 2 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\n\nPlease do read over the comments on the governance forum and review the vote linked [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) before casting a vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Enabling borrowing with a reasonable BorrowCap and the introduction of borrowing rewards, will lead to significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. \n\nThis proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards are expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below proposals details are applicable:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nIn support of the upcoming liquidity rewards distribution, this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap, enable borrowing and introduce a BorrowCap sufficient to create a notable deposit yield.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GSWOAxP.png)\n\nDetailed analysis can be found on the governance forum, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters are being proposed and have been reviewed by [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555/6).\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Loan To Value|58.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|67.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|SupplyCap|8.6M units|\n|Borrowing|Enabled|\n|BorrowingCap|5.2M|\n\nThe following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Slope1|4.00%|\n|Slope2|150.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |0.50%|\n|Stable Slope2 |150.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |2.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00%|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

This proposal will focus on revising the AVAX interest rate parameters with the goal of improving the capital efficiency of the wAVAX reserve and increasing Aave’s wAVAX revenue.\n\nWith a revised higher SupplyCap on sAVAX, we expect this to lead to an increase in the adoption of the recursive yield strategy. Increasing the availability of wAVAX supports the growth in TVL and revenue accruing to Aave with the sAVAX SupplyCap becoming the primary means limiting the adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLlama has been in discussions with various parties to develop a yield curve that supports adoption of the recursive yield strategy sAVAX/wAVAX on Avalanche v3. The strategy is modelled to be attractive whilst the utilisation of the wAVAX reserve is less than the Uoptimal point.\n\nInterest Rate at the Uoptimal point is calculated as shown below.\n\nBase + Slope1 = 70% x (LST Yield + sAVAX Deposit Incentives / 2) / ( 98% x sAVAX eMode LTV)\n\nBase + Slope1 = 70% x (7.2% + 0.41% / 2) / (98% x 92.5%)) = 4.72%\n\nThis approach reflects the following considerations:\n\n* Deposit rewards on sAVAX significantly affect the profitability of the strategy by offsetting wAVAX borrowing costs\n  * Yield earned is sAVAX yield (7.2%) + deposit incentives (0.41%)\n* sAVAX deposit rewards are diluted with more deposits, ie: 50% growth in sAVAX deposits.\n* Recursive strategy operates narrowly within the LTV of sAVAX eMode TVL\n  * 98% of the 92.5% LTV via Avax Correlated eMode\n* Recursive strategy is only attractive whilst generate supportive risk adjusted yield\n  * Looping 6 times generates around double the LST yield at Uoptimal utilisation, this is how the 70% figure is derived. This does not takes into consideration leverage transaction costs which could lead up to 1.5% of the principle and incur a 2-3 week break even period. It is assume users stay within the strategy for an extended period of time.\n\nThe current recursive strategy sAVAX/wAVAX is generating around 23.9% with a low wAVAX utilisation due to the SupplyCap for sAVAX has been reached. This yield will fall as the wAVAX utilisation increases. Assuming the SupplyCap for sAVAX is doubled, the current wAVAX interest rate curve becomes the limiting factor on the profitability of the strategy. The SupplyCap on wAVAX has a utilisation of 24.35% and offers considerable deposit capacity. There was no BorrowCap for wAVAX at the time this proposal was drafted.\n\nTo reduce the volatility in the borrow rate between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal, a Base of 1% is introduced whilst keeping the Base + Slope1 interest rate as calculated above. This generates a Slope1 of 4.72%.\n\nAdjusting the Uoptimal parameter improved the capital efficiency of the AVAX reserve. Adjusting from 45% to 65% is a substantial increase. The current utilisation is a lot lower, 28.49% and is expected to increase substantially, possibly 56.98% when the sAVAX SupplyCap is to be doubled. This is still short of the 65% Uoptimal parameter and offers users an attractive yield on the strategy. With future SupplyCap increases, the Uoptimal parameter can be revised. With a Uoptimal of 65%, there remain sufficient liquidity in the reserve to liquidate users. It is also worth noting a $5.055m USDC swap for wAVAX incurs a 2% price impact via 1inch.\n\nThe Slope2 parameter has been reduced from 300% to 144.28% to generate a borrow rate of 150% at 100% utilisation. This reduced the volatility when utilisation is in the Uoptimal < Utilisation <100% range. When utilisation is in this range the recursive strategy is not generating sufficient reward relative to holding sAVAX and will lead to strategy reducing leverage and therefore utilisation of the wAVAX reserve. Because of this relationship a gradual increase in borrowing interest is preferable and thus a lower Slope2 parameter can be implemented.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OpM3rCh.png)\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Variable Base|1.00%|\n|Uoptimal|65.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|4.72%|\n|Variable Slope2|144.28%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |4.72%|\n|Stable Slope2 |144.28%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |4%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20%|\n\nStable rates have been updated to mitigate any risk of enabling stable borrowing and having a variable borrow rate greater than the stable borrowing rate.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Create an Ethereum eMode.\nauthor: Llama - Defi_Consulting\ndated: 2023-01-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Optimism V3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAcross the Aave Liquidity Pools, stETH is listed on Aave v2 Ethereum and wstETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Optimism Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled.  \n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, more than $281k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Optimism users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Llama, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.55B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.83B) and ETH ($1.42B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Optimism Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Optimism. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and has already generated $281k by late January.\n \n![Screenshot 2023-01-29 at 19.09.51.png](ipfs://bafkreifbt44i7me57hhozvj664bdjcfjotmg4zi5qzjficp4k2boshqt6y)\n    \nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Optimism, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum. The parameters shown below are a combination of Gauntlet’s and Llama’s work.\n\n\nGauntlet’s Risk Assessment can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-wsteth-to-aave-v3-on-optimism/10932/2).\n\nLlama’s Risk Assessment can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-wsteth-to-aave-v3-on-optimism/10932/4).\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled| Yes|\n|Supply Cap (wstETH)| 6000|\n|Borrow Cap (wstETH)| **940**|\n|Debt Ceiling| 0|\n|LTV| 70.0%|\n|LT| 79.0%|\n|Liquidation Bonus| 7.2%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee |10%|\n\n## ETH eMode Category\n\n|Category|Assets Included|Loan to Value|Liquidation Threshold|Liquidation Bonus|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ethereum Correlated|wstETH wETH|90%|93%|**2%**|\n\n## Borrow Rates\n\n|Category|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Slope1|4.50%|\n|Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00|\n|Reserve Factor|**15.00**|\n \n![Screenshot 2023-01-29 at 19.10.59.png](ipfs://bafkreidrs3igaqvlz575egn46yjlp2mum2356owg3pqsxweqzbf3hkci3u)\n    \n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled.  \n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, $279k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the more conservative of the two risk service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.56B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.81B) and ETH ($1.39B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Arbitrum. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and $279k during January 2023.\n\n\n\n\nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum. The parameters shown below are a combination of Gauntlet’s and Chao’s work and utilise the same interest rate proposed by Llama for wstETH on Arbitrum.\n\n\nGauntlet’s and Chao’s combined but differing risk assessments can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-arbitrum-aave-v3/11387/7).\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled| Yes|\n|Supply Cap (in tokens)| 1,200|\n|Borrow Cap (in tokens)| 190|\n|Debt Ceiling| 0|\n|LTV| 70.0%|\n|LT| 79.0%|\n|Liquidation Bonus| 7.2%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee |10%|\n\n\n### ETH eMode Category\n\n\n|Category|Assets Included|Loan to Value|Liquidation Threshold|Liquidation Bonus|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ethereum Correlated|wstETH wETH|90%|93%|2%|\n\n\n### Borrow Rates\n\n\n|Category|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Slope1|4.50%|\n|Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",
