This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDiscord: overnight-fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time. Our token has a cross-chain functionality with the help of Axelar.\n>\n>\n> Launch Price: $20\n> Presale Price: $20\n> OVN Tokenomics: [Overnight Tokenomics ($OVN)](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/overnight-tokenomics)\n> Presale Information: [Overnight Presale Information](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/ovn-presale)\n> 25% of OVN from Private Presale unlocked on Oct 2. and the remaining 75 will be linearly vested for 4 weeks.\n>\n>  Additional Information:\n> - We cancelled public presale and just used the money raised from private presale to bootstrap liquidity on DEXes. \n> - We have launched at 20m FDV.\n> - We are already live on Aerodrome and Velodrome Finance. We also incentivized huge amount of bribes on Aerodrome (7400$) and Velodrome ($5,700) (For Sept. 28 - Oct. 5)\n> - We have also provided 22.5k OP for our Beefy Boost Program that will be distributed in over 2 weeks.\n> \n> - The rate providers was also reviewed by the integrations team and deemed safe.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n> \n> We aim to create a competitive environment that rewards participation and ensures the most efficient allocation of resources. We believe that veBAL voters are sophisticated and discerning and they will prioritize the community’s best interest. Complexity is often a byproduct of innovation. Our past experiences teach us valuable lessons, enabling us to build more robust systems.\n> \n> While 80/20 pools have been associated with locking, the beauty of the DeFi space is its adaptability. Our objective is to leverage the pool structure for its inherent benefits, not merely conform to traditional use-cases. The goal is to amplify liquidity and ensure stability, rather than exploit emissions. We’re using the pool to its fullest potential to cater to the evolving needs of the market. As also noted, the proposed bribe per week represents a significant boost in Aura’s bribe market, should all bribes be channeled in here.\n> \n> The absence of a defined market cap or trading history doesn’t undermine the intrinsic value of the coin or its future adoption potential. The proposed gauge allocation, especially the 2% caps, is informed by a forward-looking strategy, ensuring that it aligns with the expected bribes and accrued yield.\n> \n> The gauge allocation is in recognition of the potential this new coin brings. Traditional metrics, like trading history, might not fully capture the inherent value and projected adoption. We’re operating in a rapidly evolving landscape; hence, a forward-looking approach is crucial. Coingecko’s preview status doesn’t reflect the groundwork and strategic partnerships that underscore this project.\n> \n> The proposal aims to push the boundaries, capitalize on new opportunities, and ensure the best outcome for the community. We trust the veBAL voters to recognize the merit and long-term vision of this initiative.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?

        "body": "Gauge Proposal Template:\n\n**Summary:**\nPre-approve gauges for Bloom TBYs (Term Bound Yield) Tokens, the first permissionless (non-KYC, freely transferrable) US Treasury-backed Debt token on Ethereum. TBYs are completely permissionless and offer approximately 4.5% APR on USDC at scale. Native yield combined with Aura rewards may usher in a new era of profitable yield farming and attract significant TVL, while effectively funneling dollars from tradfi into the DeFi ecosystem (more net liquidity benefits us all). \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n> Link to:\n    • Website\nbloom.garden | blueberry.garden\n    • Documentation\ndocs.bloom.garden\n    • Github Page    \n https://github.com/Blueberryfi/Bloom-protocol\n    • Communities\ndiscord.gg/blueberry (15k) | twitter.com/BLBprotocol (16k) \n    • Other useful links?\nhttps://medium.com/@blueberryprotocol | testnet.bluebery.garden (20k+ unique addresses)\n\nRaise announcement: https://medium.com/@blueberryprotocol/team-behind-blueberry-raises-1-2m-to-enable-capital-efficient-borrowing-on-ethereum-f1aef0a25023\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nBloom brings yields from the US Treasury into the DeFi economy with its two permissionless and compliant products: TBYs (loans which behave like T Bills) and stUSD (yield-bearing stablecoin backed by TBYs).\n\nDocs (audit incl): docs.bloom.garden\n\nTBYs behave similarly to US T Bills, paying out a fixed-term yield over a 6-month period that can be redeemed at maturity. TBYs are the first product to bring near-treasury rates to DeFi, at scale with no KYC requirements.\n\nEach month, Bloom will open up minting for a 3-day period for that month's TBY. Users mint TBY with USDC, and are paid out in USDC at maturity. \n\nOnce a new Maturity of TBYs are active, there will be additional pools created on a rolling basis. Because there is a new TBY each month, we propose to pre-approve a gauge for all future TBYs.\n\nstUSD is a stablecoin backed by TBYs that rebases yield, much like stETH (wstUSD will also be available). We believe the applications for such a product are incredibly wide-ranging, from the most accessible USD-denominated savings app in the world (a $Trillions market), to a fundamental DeFi lego to boost yields on AMMs, money markets, and more. \n\nThe project is backed by Chainlink Labs, Bitscale (Lido Seed), and White Star Capital (Dollar Shave Club) among others.\n\n**Incentive Exclusivity Offer**\nWe understand it is unusual to approve a gauge prior to launch. As a sign of good faith and our commitment to this partnership, we will commit to making Balancer the primary trading venue upon the launch of stUSD. Of course, other DEXes may come online naturally. However, Balancer will be the exclusive DEX for incentive spending and bribing from the Bloom team for at least the first few months. We intend to scale incentive spend significantly over the first 12 months of operation in both Blueberry (BLB) tokens as well as USDC.\n\n\n> Describe the proposed asset(s), the corresponding protocol(s), and historic prices of the token (price must come from the source of highest liquidity).\nMostly done above, and please note that Bloom is going live on mainnet imminently, but it is not yet.\nTo address the pool itself: we will pair TBYs 50/50 with DSR DAI to maximize yield earned and pool stablecoin diversity. This will result in a 4% blended base yield, with trading fees and incentives on top. The net yield should prove extremely attractive in the current stablecoin landscape.\n\nIMPORTANT: Balancer will earn the protocol fees on yielding assets, similarly to stETH or other LST pools, helping bring in diversified safe treasury assets for the protocol. To ensure competitive yields and because we have chosen to set the pool with this 50% fee share, we encourage the community to increase gauge rewards, and ensure the pools have the most competitive risk-adjusted yield possible post-fees.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Explain why this pool needs incentivization\nTBYs make T Bill yields permissionless, but it comes at a cost: you lose 1% yield in the process. That means that currently, TBYs pay about 4.5%. This is already the best and safest composable/non-KYC yield in DeFi currently available. However, our goal is to start bringing dollars back from TradFi rails onto DeFi rails for the good of the whole space. \n\nThe last project to meaningfully accomplish this goal, like it or not, was Terra Luna. Why? Because they paid higher yields than tradfi. Now obviously, their source of yield was not sustainable. We now have the opportunity to build a similar ecosystem with truly sustainable yield as the backbone. Additional yield from Balancer and Aura will result in a superior risk-adjusted yield product compared to what is available off chain, so DeFi yields will lead the way once again.\n\nThis will benefit Balancer, Bloom users, and the ecosystem as a whole.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.    \n As of today, there is no token or governance for Bloom, and all changes are made by the core team and council of advisors from around the DeFi space. \n\nHowever, please note that Bloom is a fully decentralized, peer to peer protocol, where funds cannot be controlled or misappropriated by any admin. The one slight exception to this is if the swap duration to execute a batch does not complete within 3 days. In this case, we can do an emergency exit that sends the funds to the emergency handler wallet (multisig) that we then distribute back to lenders. There is no risk of loss of funds in this scenario.\n\nFor Bloom, the powers made available to the admin/multisig are:\n- Set configurations for the pools\n- Whitelist individuals that meet the ECP criteria and pass on-boarding to borrow and execute batches\n- Update the BPSFeed for the rate to maintain a pegged rate to the underlying ib01\n- Handle refunds in the event of an emergency where the pool can not advance to the next stage. \n\nIt should also be mentioned that our team is completely doxxed, very public, and VC backed.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\nChainlink provides the  [ib01oracle.](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/indexes/ib01-usd) and [USDC oracle](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd) \n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\ndocs.bloom.garden/audit\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\nPlease refer to the answer to #1 as well as the flow of funds chart on docs.bloom.garden to address this question. While there are a few vectors that require centralized efforts to start the process and manage issuer relationships, the transactions that occur themselves are fully decentralized.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\nAs mentioned, these will be new pools.\nib01 is an extremely safe ETF managed by Blackrock, which is the underlying asset TBYs derive yield from. The oracle for it is provided by Chainlink, the most secure oracle provider, sourced from large tradfi exchanges. There should be extremely low volatility, and there are circuit breakers in place in case the oracle fails, as it is obviously the nature of the product to have low volatility. Additionally, the swaps are executed during expected prices, such that there is no slippage to the any of the participant. This creates full alignment for all participants.\n\nDetails on ib01 from Blackrock [here](https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/307243/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf-fund)\n \n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) \nYes, Balancer and Aura will be the only DEX integration for the time being.",

        "body": "[PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/128)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the newly created unshETH 50/50 USH/ETH pool on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nunshETH’s governance token, USH, has launched on both BNB and Ethereum mainnet. The initial liquidity mining program will end on April 5th. The unshETH team plans to conduct the next liquidity mining program on Balancer, and to expand the collaboration between unshETH and Balancer even further in the future. Moreover, unshETH is integrated with an ecosystem partner, Stargate, that will enable scaling of its liquidity.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\nWebsite - [https://unshETH.xyz/](https://unsheth.xyz/)\n\nDocumentation - [https://docs.unshETH.xyz/](https://docs.unsheth.xyz/)\n\nGithub Page - [https://github.com/unshETH](https://github.com/UnshETH)\n\nCommunities - https://discord.com/invite/5tZXASh5P3\n\n**Other useful links?**\n\nTwitter - [https://twitter.com/unshETH_xyz](https://twitter.com/unsheth_xyz)\n\nBlog - https://mirror.xyz/0x749Dc728A68265e74754Ad8e6cc2649BD42a8f8a\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nunshETH is a decentralized, on-chain movement for improving validator decentralization. The Matrix prevents monopolies from growing so large that they stifle innovation and endanger the cryptocurrency economy by morphing into a central point of failure via the creation and enforcement of anti-competitive policies and practices.\n\nWithin Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, user activities are governed not by laws, but by protocol design and incentives. unshETH's mission is simple — decentralization through incentivization. Through incentive engineering, unshETH aims to distribute capital across the LSD ecosystem in a manner that prioritizes validator decentralization, and therefore the increased safety of the network.\n\nunshETH aims to be a catalyst for LSDfi. LSDfi refers to a new class of DeFi primitives that are built on top of liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) in order to enable markets on staking yields, validator monopolies, slashing risks, and even validator censorship.\n\nLSDfi enables use cases such as validator decentralization mining, validator dominance options, interest rate swaps, yield speculation, and efficient risk pricing. These mechanisms allow users to take advantage of the unique properties of liquid staking derivatives, and can similarly be used to improve healthy competition among validators and restrict capture of the consensus layer.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nunshETH aims to be one of the first protocols to usher in LSDfi. Adding this gauge will allow for USH to have deep, robust liquidity on Balancer markets on any chain. This proposal represents the first step in strengthening the relationship between the two protocols. In addition, this pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity on Ethereum mainnet - with future considerations for other EVM and Layer 0 compatible chains.\n\nTo achieve this, unshETH intends to begin its second liquidity mining incentives campaign (~1M USH) to veBAL/vlAURA markets. Once this amount has been emitted unshETH will consider future incentives after evaluating the performance of the gauge and depending on future protocol developments.\n\n\n**Details:**\n\nGovernance: unshETH’s governance structures for USH token holders will be launched by the end of April 2023\n\nOracles: No on-chain price feed oracles exist for the USH token at this time.\n\nOmnichain: The USH token is an omnifungible (OFT-20) token.\n\nAudits: Certik Audits of unshETH V1 and V2: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/unsheth\n](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/unsheth)\n\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n\nThe unshETH protocol is in the process of rapidly and iteratively decentralizing the protocol, in keeping with the project’s dedication to the ideology and practice of maximally decentralized finance.\n\nWith the launch of unshETH protocol V2, on April 1st, 2023, ownership by the team multisig was fully renounced and any changes affecting user-deposited funds are governed by a 72-hour timelock. Prior to this protocol upgrade there was a centralization risk of the team-controlled multi-sig being able to change oracles and approved minters.\n\nThe deployment of unshETH protocol V2 also launches configurable target weights and risk caps on the user-deposited LSD tokens underlying the unsETH token; currently target weights are set at a fair equal split across Liquid Staking ETH tokens issued by protocols chosen by the team based for their market-leadership. The unshETH team’s ability to set those target weights is a centralization risk that will be mitigated with the launch of the DAO governance structures, which the team is targeting to launch by the end of April 2023.\n\nThe launch of DAO governance and the transition to a ve-style token staking model (called vdUSH) that will empower the USH token holding community to govern protocol parameters such as the target weights.\n\n\n**Market History:** \n\nThe USH token was launched on 1/31/2023. Protocol development was not funded with any outside capital, including that of VC’s or angels. The launch was accomplished via an airdrop, announced on the unshETH blog (https://mirror.xyz/0x749Dc728A68265e74754Ad8e6cc2649BD42a8f8a/1idxwRQ3kdkXGEpmwO_IKiFTC2JgPYdWr6RdlRleTGo) to:\n\n* Early adopters of the old guard of liquid staking\n* Liquid staking pioneers who've been using LSDfi for leverage\n* The savviest yield-seekers this side of L1 (LSD-ETH LP farmers)\n* Team and early contributors\n\nThe airdrop was followed by an initial staking and liquidity mining campaign.\n\n\n**Value:** \nThis pool is intended to be a primary source of liquidity for USH on Ethereum. This gauge is the first step in building a deep collaboration with the Balancer ecosystem and community that will create value for all stakeholders. Balancer and the ecosystem of partners that Balancer has created will be a key part of the growth of unsETH protocol into the market-leader in the nascent LSDfi category.\n\n$USH trading metrics as of 04/03/2023 (Sushiswap: https://app.sushi.com/analytics/pools/0xaaf448d30f01b429fb6e7f9af6a8ff66e694f312?chainId=1):\n\n* Volume (24h) - $2,529,182\n* Fees (24h) - $7,588\n* Utilization (24h) - 106%\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n**Gauge Weight Cap**\nunshETH proposes to cap the gauge emissions to 10%. The current intention of this pool is to allow collected fees to be paid back into the gauge via Core Pool Bribes.\n\nunshETH may return to governance at a later date to request an increase as the need arises and the pool has more history to be used to evaluate it against BIP-57.\n\n\n**Gauge Type**\nNote that this gauge is a traditional gauge, not a single recipient gauge used as part of the ve80/20 program. As a result BAL incentives will be paid out to addresses depositing tokens in the Balancer Gauge. Not to a single smart contract that redirects these tokens to lockers.\n\n\n**Core Pools Designation:**\nWhile this pool contains no boosted tokens, a 0.5% fee has been set on the pool with an intention to participate in the BIP-19 boosted pool program. As with RBN/USDC gauge, It is therefore requested that 100% of the fees earned by this pool and not paid to the DAO are used to pay bribes on the pool. It is further requested that these fees are used bribe the USH/ETH pool directly, instead of participating in the distribution of bribes by TVL as following the protocol for mainnet instead of for side-chains specified in BIP-19. Handling of this pool should change in line with changes to BIP-19.\n\n\n**Details of Gauge to be whitelisted**\nGauge address: [0xCd8bB8cEBc794842967849255C234e7b7619A518](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCd8bB8cEBc794842967849255C234e7b7619A518#code)\nPool address: [0xeabaf850fd494c5661ba15ea5307c11d5307d0e2](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xeabaf850fd494c5661ba15ea5307c11d5307d0e2/about)\n\nThe specific actions of authorizing the DAO multisig, adding the gauge, and removing the authorization using the gauge address above are included in the linked payload.\n\nAuthor\nHarpe is an independent contributor to the unshETH protocol, pursuing growth of the unshETH protocol through collaboration with other DeFi teams and DAOs.

Inverse DAO governs and develops a suite of permissionless and decentralized financial tools using blockchain smart contract technology. The code base is open source and maintained by the community.\n\nInverse DAO’s core product is DOLA, a debt-backed USD stablecoin. DOLA is added into and removed from circulation;\n\n* On the supply side of money markets, such as DAO-owned protocol FiRM, by Inverse Finance's “Fed” contracts and is then made available to be borrowed through over-collateralized loans.\n* Via injection/contractions into pools such as the Curve DOLA/FraxBP (currently $11.6M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Velodrome ($3.2M TVL), DOLA/USDC on Balancer ($3.8m TVL on ETH, $4.3m TVL on Arbitrum) and DOLA/USDbC on Aerodrome ($17m TVL)\n\nDOLA is not \"algorithmic\" and the INV governance token is not used to mint or redeem DOLA.\n\n**About PRISMA**\n\nPrisma is a new DeFi primitive focused on unlocking the full potential of Ethereum liquid staking tokens (LSTs). Prisma allows users to mint a stablecoin (mkUSD) fully collateralized by liquid staking tokens. The stablecoin is incentivized on Curve and Convex Finance to create a capital-efficient flywheel where users can receive trading fees, CRV, CVX, and PRISMA on top of their Ethereum staking rewards. Prisma’s codebase is completely immutable, based on Liquity, in order to create a robust protocol and truly decentralized stablecoin with favorable and flexible collateral parameters to make it attractive for those wanting to get more from their LSTs without tail risks from other stablecoins. The Prisma DAO is in charge of parameters, emissions, and protocol fees. Prisma has previously received a seed investment from Curve Finance, Convex, Frax, LlamaNodes and many others.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nThis proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the recently deployed DOLA/mkUSD LP on Balancer. This pool marks the debut of a mkUSD stable LP on Balancer, and is created as a joint effort of PRISMA and Inverse Finance to onboard our users to the Balancer ecosystem. Inverse Finance has a long and fruitful history with Balancer, and can currently count on gauges for INV/DOLA and DOLA/USDC on Balancer Mainnet, Arbitrum and Optimism (via Beets). Inverse Finance is eager to build deep DOLA liquidity on Balancer on mainnet.\n\nThe Inverse Finance Team plans to continue being a major adopter of Balancer technology and onboard PRISMA to the ecosystem. Together, both protocols intend to make full use of the bribe incentivizer for BAL emissions to help accelerate and deepen our liquidity pool. Once the DOLA/mkUSD stable pool is whitelisted for BAL rewards, our bribe incentives program would begin to promote trading, bribing, LP farming activity on Balancer. Eventually, PRISMA intend to incorporate this pool into their Gauge controller, meaning PRISMA rewards flow directly to it.\n\n### Specifications:\n\nYou can view analytics for DOLA on Defillama. To learn more about the protocol, please visit our [official docs](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/about-inverse), [governance](https://www.inverse.finance/governance) and our [transparency](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) pages.\n\n> 1. Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n\n**About Inverse Finance**\n\nInverse Finance Fed contracts mint DOLA directly to the supply side of lending markets or to pools such as the DOLA/FraxBP[ Curve](https://curve.fi/factory/27) pool as demand increases, or they retract and burn DOLA from the supply when demand decreases. The Fed contracts are governed by the Inverse Finance DAO, which is controlled by INV holders through governance. A detailed description of our governance can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/all-about-governance-at-inverse-finance). Equally, check out our transparency portal [here](https://www.inverse.finance/transparency/overview) which gives a visual representation of Inverse Finance Governance.\n\n**About PRISMA**\n\nPrisma is an immutable and fully on-chain protocol. Despite this, some minimal admin functions are retained and operated via governance. Some examples of possible admin actions include: modifying fees, adding or removing a collateral, pausing or unpausing protocol functionality, transfer protocol fees, adjusting the quorum on admin votes.\n\n> 2. Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\n**About Inverse Finance**\n\nInverse Finance’s new fixed-rate money market, FiRM, uses Chainlink price feeds for all markets on FiRM, with some implementations also utilizing Curve EMA price feeds.\n\n**About PRISMA**\n\nPrisma uses Chainlink oracles as well as a custom Frax oracle (also used by crvUSD).\n\n> 3. Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\n**About Inverse Finance**\n\nInverse Finance has undergone multiple audits and bug contests, which can be found linked [here](https://www.inverse.finance/audits).\n\nThe DAO also now has dedicated members overseeing risk, what we call the Risk Working Group. An announcement of the team’s formation can be found [here](https://www.inverse.finance/blog/posts/en-US/Introducing%20the%20Inverse%20Finance%20Risk%20Working%20Group).\n\n**About PRISMA**\n\nPrisma has completed three audits from Nomoi, MixBytes and Zellic. Audits can be viewed [here](https://github.com/prisma-fi/audits). More information regarding security at Inverse Finance can be found on the [risk docs here](https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/technical/audits).\n\n> 4. Centralization Vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nSpecification\nmethod to add via governance: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x6D560CbE3Cc25Eca8c930835Ec3d296a6C16B210\n\ngaugeType(string): Ethereum\n\n> Note: The forum sections providing information about Inverse Finance and Prisma have been removed from this Snapshot proposal to adhere to the 10'000 character limit while still containing on-chain specifications.

Gains Network aims to list a gUSDC/Aave USDC pool, gUSDC benefits from protocol fees on gTrade, while Aave USDC receives borrow yield through Aave. We chose to establish this on Balancer to attract significant liquidity and bolster further integrations within the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n• Website https://gains.trade/ \n• Documentation https://gains-network.gitbook.io/docs-home \n• Github Page https://github.com/GainsNetwork-org \n• Communities https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io  - https://discord.com/invite/gains-network \n• Other useful links? https://dune.com/gains/gtrade_stats \nhttps://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x69d9bc07a19caad9ae4ca40af18d5a688839a29900020000000000000000058e\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n>Gains Network [(gTrade)](https://gains.trade/trading#BTC-USD) is a decentralized perpetual futures trading platform with a robust infrastructure featuring 197 trading pairs with high leverage [up to 150x for crypto, 250x for commodities, and 1000x on forex], deep liquidity, guaranteed order execution, and accurate pricing. Since inception, the protocol has generated $78.3B lifetime volume.\nThe asset Gains Network would like to list on Balancer is gUSDC paired with Aave USDC. gUSDC is one of the gVault tokens that receives a share of the protocol fees by serving as a counterparty to trader wins & losses.\nThe history price of gUSDC can be publicly viewed on our dune dashboard linked above. It has generally been an “up-only” asset with the exception of a few dips shortly after the launch of the asset back in January.\nThe historical price of gUSDC can be found here: https://dune.com/queries/3385617/5681244\nAnd, here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gains-network-usdc\n\n>**Motivation:**\nGains Network aims to enable a gauge for a gUSDC / Aave USDC pool to significantly increase the liquidity for gUSDC on secondary markets by pairing this with a highly capital efficient asset like Aave USDC. This will set the foundation for more integrations with the purpose of expanding gUSDC utility across Arbitrum DeFi.\nIt's great to pair gUSDC with Aave USDC because this increases the overall yield in the pool and increases the attractiveness of the entire pool from an LP perspective. Furthermore, an E-CLP pool allows you to  build a curve that specifically suits gUSDC and the related price volatility.  \n\n\n>**Specifications:**\nGains Network will utilize a part of its STIP.B LP incentives budget to bootstrap more (sticky) liquidity for the [gUSDC](https://gains.trade/vaults/gUSDC) vault as it anticipates more USDC-collateral usage on gTrade over the coming months. Initially, the focus will be on building liquidity on partner DEXs for gUSDC pools, including this Balancer pool. This strategy aims to unlock various partnership opportunities, creating an ecosystem around gUSDC through lending markets, LP-strategy protocols, and more.\nGains Network is seeking to co-incentivize this pool with Balancer to establish the required liquidity as a foundation for said gUSDC integrations and consecutively form a long-term partnership with Balancer as one of the main venues for gUSDC since Gains Network believes Balancer’s pool designs can be largely be maintained beyond STIP.B incentives through swapping fees & incentives post the bootstrapping phase. \n\n1. **Governance:** Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure.     Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n   \nThe incentives distributor is governed by the following Multisig address: [0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D\n](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc5fCA2c19c5Ca269a10e15ee4A800ed82F53787D)And, Gains Network is actively working towards being a DAO governed through the $GNS token.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\ngTrade leverages their own custom-built Chainlink decentralized oracle network (DON) to provide real-time, aggregated prices for their leveraged trading products. The oracle architecture uses a custom DON to supply on-demand prices to an aggregator contract while the official Chainlink Price Feeds serve as anchors, meaning if their price differs by more than 1.5% from Chainlink Price Feeds, a circuit breaker is triggered.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nAudits are conducted with each upgrade Gains Network undergoes. With the release of [V8 in May](https://medium.com/gains-network/introducing-gtrade-v8-diamond-refactor-and-smart-contract-integration-a175b96ccb82), the entire codebase has been audited. Moreover, the release of [V9](https://x.com/GainsNetwork_io/status/1807877092836610406) [current version] has been audited as well.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nWe will state our centralization vectors by giving insights into our most centralized facet: the DON. The current custom decentralized oracle network is operated by 8 independent chainlink node operators & 1 price feed from StorkOracle.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nA Balancer has been set up for gUSDC/USDC. This has been running since July 12th where TVL went up to $1.12M and has since come down to around $500K .\n\nhttps://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xe8a6026365254f779b6927f00f8724ea1b8ae5e0000000000000000000000580\n\nThe gUSDC asset is tradeable on a Ramses CL pool as per June 15th and started to get incentivized with $ARB from June 27th onwards. The pool is currently sitting at $520K TVL and can be found here: https://ramses.exchange/liquidity/v2/0xe9e3ef12f1f9dbaf7b7f57ab262c54117448884b\n\nRecently, a Camelot pool went live on the 5th of August. The TVL currently sits at: $1.04M\n\nhttps://app.camelot.exchange/pools/0x1470b62eB67225f6EcDF8249293C8052f1cd2717\n\nThe new pool that we’re looking to incentivize is:\n\n[https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x69d9bc07a19caad9ae4ca40af18d5a688839a29900020000000000000000058e\n](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x69d9bc07a19caad9ae4ca40af18d5a688839a29900020000000000000000058e)\n\nSince the inception of this secondary market pool, Gains Network vaults have been consistently overcollateralized while the gUSDC asset has never been below peg and has not experienced significant volatility. Considering the ‘up-only’ nature of gTokens and gUSDC currently sitting at a 107.88% collateralization ratio, the price of gUSDC is expected to continue its upwards price action as time passes.\n \n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?) \n\nThe pool will not serve as the primary source of liquidity in the bootstrapping phase, but will be leveraged as the primary source of liquidity once the bootstrapping phase has passed. \nThe pool can generate consistent fees due to gUSDC depositors only being able to use Balancer as a means of exiting before our epoch system, looping through lending markets & liquidations through lending markets.\n\nChild Chain Gauge - https://arbiscan.io/address/0xdDbDca6213b4a03d8C6fC1419Ef7B0b16B61d363\nMainnet Root Gauge - https://etherscan.io/address/0x86893f6829dA1296F739F50Ff9d3923453E9b48D \n\n**Technical Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x86893f6829dA1296F739F50Ff9d3923453E9b48D`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
