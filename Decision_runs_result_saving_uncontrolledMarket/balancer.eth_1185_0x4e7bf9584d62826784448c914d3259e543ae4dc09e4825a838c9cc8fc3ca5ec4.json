        "body": "Authors\n\nFrax Finance Core Team\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal seeks to deploy Balancer on the Fraxtal Network, enabling liquidity provision and fostering ecosystem growth. The deployment will be supported by the Flox program, incentivizing active liquidity, and expanding available assets through DeFi use cases built on Fraxtal.\n\nIntroduction\n\nFraxtal is a modular rollup blockchain (L2) with a \"fractal scaling\" roadmap. It boasts a range of familiar and novel features that set it apart:\n\n* Fraxtal operates as an EVM equivalent rollup, leveraging the OP stack as its smart contract platform and execution environment. This ensures that deploying applications is as fast, secure, and cost-effective as leading Ethereum rollups like Optimism & Base.\n* Fraxtal implements blockspace incentives, known as Flox, which reward users and developers for gas expenditure and smart contract interaction across the network. Every epoch, users spending gas and developers deploying contracts that consume gas earn FXTL points. This novel approach allows users to earn more rewards than gas spent and developers to earn beyond the gas consumed by their dapps.\n* The native gas token within Fraxtal is Frax Ether (frxETH), issued by Frax Finance, offering an efficient and tailored solution for transactional needs within the ecosystem.\n\nProposal Details\n\nMotivations\n\n**Access to Fraxtal's Growing Ecosystem:** By deploying on Fraxtal, Balancer gains access to a rapidly growing ecosystem with significant potential for expansion and innovation. Fraxtal's modular rollup architecture, combined with its EVM equivalent functionality and blockspace incentives, offers Balancer an ideal environment to reach new users, tap into emerging markets, and explore novel use cases.\n\n**Integration with Flox Program:** Fraxtal's innovative Flox program presents an opportunity for Balancer to integrate its automated market-making mechanisms into a thriving incentive ecosystem. By participating in the Flox program, Balancer can incentivize liquidity providers and developers to engage with its protocol, driving liquidity growth and adoption while maximizing value for its ecosystem participants.\n\n**Liquidity Provisioning and Fraxtal Growth:** Balancer's flexible and efficient automated market-making mechanisms make it an ideal candidate for liquidity providers on Fraxtal. Through Balancer's deployment, we anticipate a significant increase in liquidity provision, facilitating seamless asset swaps and improving the overall user experience on the Fraxtal network. This, in turn, will contribute to the growth and expansion of Fraxtal as a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\n**Positioning Balancer as Core Infrastructure:** Integrating Balancer into the Fraxtal ecosystem will establish it as core network infrastructure and pave the way for future product developments. By leveraging point incentives through the Flox program, we can catalyze growth across various use cases and amplify the impact of this deployment.\n\nProposal\n\nThis proposal asks the Balancer community to support the deployment of Balancer on the Fraxtal Network. Specifically, we propose the following:\n\n* Authorize the deployment of Balancer on Fraxtal.\n* Integrate Balancer into the Flox program to incentivize trade volume and liquidity provision.\n* Collaborate with Balancer contributors on a deployment timeline that aligns with Fraxtal's objectives.\n\nTimeline/Next Steps:\n\nFraxtal will facilitate discussions and work closely with the Balancer community to finalize deployment details and timelines.\n\nLinks\n\nProject: https://www.frax.com/\n\nEcosystem: https://www.frax.com/ecosystem\n\nDocs: https://docs.frax.com/fraxtal\n\nGithub: https://github.com/FraxFinance/fraxtal-node\n\nFraxscan: https://fraxscan.com/\n\nBridge: https://mainnet.frax.com/tools/bridge/deposit\n\nAudit: https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/fraxfinance",

        "body": "gm Balancer Community! Cameron here from Linea; we are excited to share an updated proposal on a potential Balancer deployment.\n\n## Intro\n\nPrior to Linea mainnet, [we proposed deploying](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-333-deploy-balancer-on-linea/4782) Balancer on the network. It was not the right time for a successful collaboration. However, since then, the Linea core team has been working on shipping new tech, onboard top partners, and growing the ecosystem.\n\nLinea offers EVM equivalence, scalability, and reduced transaction costs while maintaining Ethereum's security guarantees through Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The network has seen consistent growth, with current TVL at ~$605.5 M on the network per[ L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/linea), and ~$334M in tracked protocols, according to [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Linea).\n\nNow is the perfect time to revisit this proposal on growing Balancers' presence on the network.\n___\n\n## Proposal Details\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis proposal asks the Balancer community to support deployment on the Linea Network and exploration in enabling incentives.\n\n### Motivation\n\nOur motivation is threefold:\n\n1. *Participation in the Surge, liquidity campaign*\n2. *To support the growth of Key partners*\n3. *Position Balancer as core network infrastructure and innovate on future product developments*\n\n#### 1 | Participation in the Surge\n\nThe Surge program is a points based activation focused on growing liquidity and will go live in *1-2* *weeks*. It aims to bootstrap protocols like Balancer, enhancing the ecosystem by distributing points for active liquidity. This will ensure the expansion of available assets through DeFi use cases built on Linea.\n\nPoints, represented as non-transferable *ERC20* tokens, will help measure user contributions towards the network's decentralization. By encouraging additional liquidity, we anticipate creating a flywheel effect that bolsters both new use cases and overall network volume.\n\nLinea is committed to including the Balncer protocol in the Surge program within the first 1-2 weeks of going live. *(deployment dependant)*\n\nYou can read more about the Surge below:\n- [Overview](https://docs.linea.build/use-mainnet/linea-surge/linea-surge-overview)\n- [Point Incentive Design](https://docs.linea.build/use-mainnet/linea-surge/linea-surge-model)\n\n#### 2 | Supporting Key Partners\n\nLinea is proud to partner with key protocols. The network's primary focus is expanding our liquid restaking token ecosystem. An example of this effort is our collaboration with RENZO, which has led to [ezETH](https://lineascan.build/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5) growth of over $100M USD. Although there are existing AMM solutions on the network, there's a notable demand for Balancer pools from prominent LRT firms, bridges, and stablecoin issuers.\n\nThis demand highlights a unique opportunity to establish significant liquidity on Balancer from the outset. Moreso, leveraging point incentives through the Surge program can catalyze growth across diverse use cases, amplifying the impact of this deployment.\n\n#### 3 | Product Integrations\n\nLinea's strategic positioning to the Consensys product suite, including the decentralized infrastructure network *(DIN)* and MetaMask, opens up various collaboration opportunities in the short term *(< 6 months)* and long term *(> 6 months)* ✨🦊🟧\n\n**Short term,**  Given Balancer's critical role in MetaMask Swaps on other networks, we anticipate it will also emerge as a primary route for swaps on Linea. Further, we would like to keep Protocol Contributors up to date with our collaboration with the MetaMask Portfolio - as we aim to create a hub of Web3 activities for users.\n\n**Long term,** the Linea growth team is committed to working closely with key stakeholders on integrating with upcoming Consensys products. While specifics are non-public, our goal is to bring new user experiences to the ecosystem, by leveraging our product suite.\n___\n\n## Other Information\n\n### About Linea\n* [Linea ](http://linea.build/)\n* [Linea Block Explorer](https://lineascan.build/)\n* [Linea Docs](https://docs.linea.build/)\n\n### Key Infrastructure\n\n* [Safe](https://safe.linea.build/welcome)\n* [RPC Endpoints](https://docs.linea.build/build-on-linea/tooling/node-providers)\n* [Messaging services & Bridge providers](https://linea.build/apps?types=bridge)\n\n### Timeline/Next Steps\n\nWe encourage discussion and will facilitate conversation with the community. If this proposal passes, we will work closely with contributors on a timeline that aligns with Balancer contributors on a deployment.",

        "body": "Hello Balancer community, I’m Abdul and I lead BD for ecosystem at Monad Labs. I’m reaching out today with a proposal to deploy Balancer on the Monad blockchain.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nMonad is an upcoming high-performance EVM-equivalent L1 that introduces parallel EVM to enable 10,000 tps, 1-second block times and single-slot finality while preserving full bytecode EVM equivalence. Testnet launch is planned for Q2 and mainnet launch is planned for Q4 of this year.\n\nBalancer’s current and upcoming products are an excellent fit for the emerging DeFi ecosystem of Monad. Balancer’s Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools will be able to capture significant opportunity as new projects emerge on Monad, while Balancer’s flexible support for advanced AMM pool behaviors, such as concentrated liquidity, boosted pools, and stable math, will benefit from the extremely low fees and high throughput of Monad’s parallel EVM.\n\nWe propose to deploy Balancer products on Monad at both testnet and mainnet launches, advancing the Balancer vision of democratizing DeFi innovation on a broad scale.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThis proposal seeks the backing of the Balancer community for the deployment of Balancer on both the Monad testnet and mainnet. Combining Balancer's distinctive features with Monad's high-performance EVM will be a significant unlock for developers and users.\n\nBalancer’s flexibility, customizability, low slippage, and support for bootstrapping liquidity make it a perfect fit for Monad’s parallel & performant EVM architecture. Deploying Balancer on Monad prior to the mainnet launch will enhance Balancer’s position as a leading and innovative hub of DeFi activity.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nShould this proposal be approved, Monad contributors will collaborate with Balancer contributors to determine a deployment timeline that suits both Balancer and the respective Monad public testnet and mainnet launches.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe deployment of Balancer products on the Monad blockchain provides a unique opportunity for both the Balancer and Monad ecosystems. Deployment will bring advanced DeFi capabilities to the users of a fast-growing ecosystem, and will bring together two vibrant communities.\n\n**About Monad**\n\nMonad is a high-performance EVM-equivalent L1 blockchain, built with a focus on performance and written from scratch in C++ and Rust. Monad materially advances the efficient frontier in the tradeoff between decentralization and scalability through superscalar pipelining and parallelization.\n\nMonad introduces optimizations in four major areas, resulting in a blockchain with throughput of 10,000 transactions per second:\n\n* MonadBFT - custom high-performance, two-phased consensus mechanism derivative of Hotstuff\n* Asynchronous Execution - decoupled execution runs in parallel to consensus rather than as a prerequisite\n* Parallel Execution - optimistic execution of block transactions in parallel, akin to OCC and STM\n* MonadDb - custom state database designed for optimal MPT-based reads and writes\n\nMonad's improvements address existing bottlenecks while preserving seamless compatibility for application developers (full EVM bytecode compatibility) and users (Ethereum RPC API compatibility). As a result, the rich landscape of Ethereum tooling and applied cryptography research can plug seamlessly into Monad while benefiting from improved throughput and scale:\n\n* applications (any dapp built for Ethereum)\n* developer tooling (e.g. Hardhat, Apeworx, Foundry)\n* wallets (e.g. MetaMask)\n* analytics/indexing (e.g. Etherscan, Dune)\n\nFurther, the Monad community consists of a passionate group of builders, traders, creators that are excited about the continued growth and development of on-chain partnerships.\n\nAdditional resources on the team, technology, and community of Monad can be found here:\n\n- Documentation: https://docs.monad.xyz\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/monad_xyz\n- Web: https://monad.xyz",

        "author": "0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17",
        "body": "1. Summation\n\nAegis Finance proposes an agreement to collaborate with Balancer within a strategic partnership in exchange for 1% supply of Aegis’ utility token SHIELD to be allocated at the discretion of Balancer DAO.\n\n2. What is Aegis?\n\nAegis is an upcoming Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) platform launching native to Frax Finance’s Fraxtal Layer 2. The project is fully supported by Frax with the relationship being strong enough to the point Sam Kazemian himself is an official advisor. The platform at its core is operated under a formal licensing agreement with Liquity with their upcoming V2 backend. Upon launch, the team will continue to build upon the concept to build a highly liquid, cross chain lending solution with competitive borrow rates and collateral requirements.\n\nThe CDP Market will allow users to borrow against Wrapped Ether, Select Stablecoins and FRAX native assets with multi collateral enabled vaults at a minimum collateral ratio of 110% (90.9% Loan To Value (LTV)). Multi collateral vaults enable users to supply multiple assets within a singular debt position. Within this, users only need to supply sufficient reserves to meet a 100% collateral ratio of external assets in some circumstances. This can occur if users choose to allocate part of their collateral position in SHIELD. Other innovative features will include one click looping leverage for positions, and a platform yield boosting direct incentives layer.\n\nThe ecosystem will consist of two tokens, the first being the SHIELD utility token and the borrow-to-mint aegUSD stablecoin. SHIELD will be used as the native liquidity token while aegUSD will strictly be for lending purposes. SHIELD has a max supply of 100,000,000 while aegUSD is demand elastic.\n\nAegis will be the first native CDP platform on Fraxland and will work closely with the Frax Team to build robust liquidity and spread awareness. Aegis will eventually go cross chain onto Ethereum Mainnet along with other to be later announced Layer 2s.\n\n3. Aegis Strategic Alignment and Support from Frax\n\nAs stated, the Aegis Team will closely be working in tandem with the Frax Team in order to maximize scaling the platform. The teams have collectively built a plan to build large liquidity pairs between assets and to comarket. Brainfund has already contributed 50,000 FRAX as initial pre-seed funding.\n\nCDP markets are a growing trend in DeFi by offering permissionless loans that do not require a sell side party to add new debt positions. This allows for seamless user experience by avoiding the frustration of lack of contribution incentives present in Peer to Peer (P2P) platform architecture. As Aegis will be the first Frax backed CDP platform, the convenience and overall benefits of the loan structure architecture will seamlessly translate to Fraxtal’s already impressive ecosystem.\n\nThe Aegis Team will also collaborate with other Fraxtal lending ecosystem players like Fraxlend to further coalign with the ecosystem’s ethos. Overall, the main objective of Aegis is to grow rapidly while simultaneously assisting to continue Fraxtal’s overall scaling.\n\n4. Opportunity on Fraxtal for Balancer\n\nFraxtal is one of the fastest growing Layer 2s in DeFi. It launched in February 2024 and has already surpassed $130,000,000 TVL. Founder Sam Kazemian is optimistic this growth will continue as the Layer 2 matures. A challenge all platforms face is competing regardless of innovation of a finite amount of liquidity present. Within this conundrum, platforms like Balancer stand out as a leader in assisting projects to incentivize liquidity provisions.\n\nAs Frax and Fraxtal are leading and reputable platforms, it makes sense that the incentives to collaborate have emerged between Frax’s Fraxtal and Balancer. Aegis invisions leading the charge in a growing relationship between the platforms well into the future.\n\n5. Aegis's specific asks of Balancer\n\nIn exchange for an agreement, Aegis wants to delegate responsibilities to Balancer to further the collective relationship. The Aegis Team proposes the following tasks for Balancer to adhere to:\n\n1. Public Facing Support from Balancer\n\nThis includes leveraging Balancer’s network to assist in comarketing the strategic partnership for the betterment of all parties. Within this, it includes social media support such as composting and boosting Aegis posts to collaboration in business development (BD) processes.\n\n2. Support with Pools/Incentives\n\nThe Aegis Team plans on leveraging Balancer’s liquidity pool technology to offer competitive yields on LPs. Although left up to the discretion of the Balancer DAO, allocated SHIELD within this proposed agreement can be used to support heavily incentivized Aegis pools on the platform. This will be of benefit to all associated parties.\n\n6. Incentives for Passing Proposal\n\nWithin a consensus to proceed with passing this proposal, Aegis Finance has allocated 1% of SHIELD supply to the Balancer DAO. Upon passing and transfer of the supply, The DAO is within its rights to come to consensus of specific allocations and uses of the funds acquired.\n\nThe transfer of the funds will be upon launch of Aegis within the upcoming few months. The 1% will be transferred and unlocked for appropriate use at the discretion of Balancer’s DAO. .25% will be unlocked upon launch with the remaining .75% distributed proportionally on a monthly basis over 18 months. These funds are targeted to both an increase in collaboration between the project but also to further the reputations of all respective parties.\n\n\"Aegis will be one of the most innovative Fraxtal DeFi dApps in the Frax ecosystem. Its unique CDP system will allow for fully decentralized lending-borrowing on day 1. We're excited to work closely with the Aegis team to help them bring their vision to life on Fraxtal ensuring that Aegis integrates seamlessly and expands swiftly, reflecting the rapid ascent of Fraxtal itself.”\n\n-Sam Kazemian, CEO of FRAX\n\nTechnical Specification:\n\n1% or 1,000,000 SHIELD tokens will be sent to the Balancer DAO Multisig on Fraxtal 0x4f22C2784Cbd2B24a172566491Ee73fee1A63c2e .This is to be used at the discretion of the DAO. As mentioned our recombination is prudent use at least in partial.\n\nInitial Unlock: .083333% or 83,333 SHIELD tokens \n\nRemaining Unlocking Over: 12 months with .076389% or 76,389 SHIELD unlocked on monthly basis",

We view Balancer’s composable liquidity products as critical building blocks of decentralized finance and we want to work with you to further expand your growth on Scroll into the future.\n\nIf approved, Balancer contributors will launch on Scroll as soon as possible after our Mainnet launch. This would add Scroll to the list of networks approved as new deployments by governance.\n\n## Background\n\n### About Scroll\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP](https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP) \nForum: [https://community.scroll.io/](https://community.scroll.io/)\n\nScroll is an L2 scaling solution that is pushing the development of an Ethereum-equivalent zkEVM. Our main priorities are to implement a bytecode-level compatible zkEVM with sound zero knowledge proofs, work on related initiatives to coordinate the development of Layer 1 and zkEVM, and reach a community standard to improve Ethereum for the end game. Security is of the highest priority for us and our current EVM implementation is well-specified and robust. Our in-house security team also operates in close conjunction with the highest-caliber auditors in the industry.\n\nScroll is built on a completely open source basis. This includes the ZK circuits, the proving system, and the verifier smart contract. Code security is also closely monitored by community developers from projects such as Zcash, 0xPARC, Privacy and Scaling Explorations, and Filecoin.\n\nToday, Scroll is currently live on the Goerli Testnet and contracts can be deployed permissionlessly by anyone anywhere. We maintain a trustless Layer 1 <> Layer 2 bridge that supports arbitrary message delivery. The bridge is part of the rollup mechanism, verified by the smart contract and the zkEVM, which is more secure than classical relayer-based bridges.\n\n### **Goals**\n\nWe propose for Balancer to deploy on Scroll as early as possible (pending Scroll’s Mainnet launch). The Scroll Foundation will actively ensure that early dApp deployments to Scroll will run sustainably after launch.\n\nOn our side, there is growing interest from Lending Protocols (including Aave) and Liquid Staking Protocols such as Lido and Rocket Pool for Balancer to deploy on Scroll. These protocols have shown interest in expanding their existing efforts with Balancer onto Scroll, which signals to us that the deployment of Balancer on Scroll is a high-priority task. We want to enable opportunities for Balancer to solidify a strong position in the Scroll ecosystem early on to bring value to both of our communities. \n\nCurrent areas where we see Balancer playing a key role include: \n- Supporting Liquid staking derivative projects seed liquidity for their respective assets on Scroll \n- Utilizing Cross-chain gauge boosts to leverage Aura Finance following LayerZero’s deployment on Scroll\n\nWe will also actively discover areas within our ecosystem where Balancer’s offerings will find fit, and make those connections accordingly with the DAO.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, Balancer contributors will launch on Scroll as soon as possible after our Mainnet launch. This would add Scroll to the list of networks approved as new deployments by governance.",
