        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Avalanche v2 to v3 Migration\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-08-28\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes redeeming all Aave DAO funds on Aave v2 Avalanche and depositing the underlying assets into Aave v3 Avalanche. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThis publications progresses the [[TEMP CHECK] proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x0be8229173181fe0aaf5ed1883e53752546efb810e55610e7ac8b991155ab788) to migrate Aave DAO's funds from Avalanche v2 to v3.\n\nAave DAO currently holds around $4.58M on Avalanche v2. The publication supports redeeming the assets shown below from v2 Avalanche and deposit them in v3 Avalanche. \n\n \n![Screenshot 2023-08-28 at 09.23.18.png](ipfs://bafkreiggndqcywgealtinsz7yu3s6e7fmpkcla6r5r6fyqnsjd6jrxt6oi)\n    \n\nThe deposit rates on v3 are great than v2 and there is also wAVAX incentives being distributed across v3.\n\nIf required, this proposal is to be implemented via multiple AIPs to ensure there is sufficient Supply Cap capacity to enable funds to be deposited into v3. \n\nDo note, the borrow rate on v2 will increase in response to migrating funds from v2.  \n\nTransferring the DAOs funds from v2 to v3 can be performed via the migration tool developed by @bgdlabs. There are also smaller holdings, example: wAVAX, that can be deposited to earn yield. This proposal will result in ~8.3% of the TVL on v2 being migrated to v3. \n\nFor reference, the Aave Avalanche v2 Treasury: [`0x5ba7fd868c40c16f7aDfAe6CF87121E13FC2F7a0`](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x5ba7fd868c40c16f7aDfAe6CF87121E13FC2F7a0)\n\n# Specification\n\nPerform the following:\n\n* Transfer funds from v2 to v3 via migration tool (can be one or several AIPs, subj. Supply Cap restrictions)\n* Deposit passively held assets into v3 \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The initial commit from the Aura Finance team was 400,000 units of vlAURA for an initial 3 month duration.\n\nThis proposal seeks to replace the support from Aura Finance by acquiring 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO. Olympus DAO is reducing there AURA exposure due to change in the Olympus DAO roadmap which is detailed [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3756-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus) and [her](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3967-tap29-aura-solicitation-to-bid).\n\nBased upon the research presented in this [Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682), which details impact AIP-42 by Aura Finance, the most efficient way for Aave DAO to bootstrap GHO is via vlAURA relative to veBAL. \n\nOlympus DAO seeks payment in DAI, at an exchange rate of 0.9470 DAI per unit of AURA. The amount of AURA is 443,674 with a total cost to Aave DAO of 420,159.28 units of DAI. Aave DAO currently holds [2.873M](https://etherscan.io/token/0x028171bca77440897b824ca71d1c56cac55b68a3?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) units of aDAI on Aave v2.\n\n**Olympus DAO is conducting an open forum auction over 3 day period, bids are placed relative to the spot price derived from the AURA/wETH pool on Balancer v2.\n\nThe USD price will be updated within this proposal progressively over the bidding period. Do note, Aave DAO's governance process duration exceeds that of Olympus DAO's which means Aave DAO's voting occurs afterwards and ultimately determines if/when the OTC swap will occur**\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will achieve the following:\n\n* Redeem 420,159.28 units aDAI from Aave v2\n* Exchange 420,159.28 units of DAI for 443,674 units of AURA with Olympus DAO\n\nFor reference, Olympus DAO AURA Holding Address: `0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B`\n\nThe contract shall be developed in collaboration with @MarcZeller and deployed by the ACI team.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Extend Safety Module Coverage to Polygon v3\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz and 3SE\nDated: 2023-02-14\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThe proposal presents Aave the opportunity to extend the Safety Module coverage to include Polygon v3.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe Safety Module is a set of smart contracts allowing AAVE & aBPT (representing Balancer V1 ETH/AAVE LP) token holders to stake their tokens in exchange for a share of the distribution of Safety Incentives sourced from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve.\n\nStakers in the safety module, lock their liquidity for a minimum of 10 days, and in the case of a shortfall event affecting the covered Aave markets, expose their stake assets to be mobilised to cover excess protocol debt up to 30% of their staked funds.\n\nA Snapshot vote will determine if Aave extends the coverage of the Safety module to Aave Polygon v3. There is currently $154.80m of TVL deployed on Polygon v3.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave v3 is the most recent implementation of the Aave protocol, allowing new features, optimizations, and mitigation of risks.\n\nAave v3 has been battle tested for ~11 months in several networks, and its code was deemed safe enough to be allowed deployment on the Ethereum mainnet by the Aave governance.\n\nThe authors are supportive of extending coverage of Aave v3 by the safety module in order to offer the Polygon v3 users the same level of coverage as v2 users.\n\nSoon, rewards are to be distributed across the v3 deployment encouraging v2 users to migrate. Extend the Safety Module to the v3 deployment further supports the migration of user’s capital to the v3 deployment. To help facilitate this, BGD has released a migration tool which can be accessed Aave the Aave front end.\n\n# Specification\n\nIf a Short Fall event was to occur, similar to the CRV excess debt event during 2022, an ARC is required to determine how Aave is to respond. If Aave elects to proceed with auctioning funds held in the Safety Module, this will be implemented via an AIP.\n\nThis proposal is for Aave to agree in principle, via Snapshot, to set a precedent that the Polygon v3 deployment will be supported by the Safety Module if a short fall event were to occur.\n\nA successful Snapshot vote which follows the AIP voting criteria will determine if the Safety Module is extended to cover the Polygon v3 market.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This will enable AGD contributors and grant recipients to be rewarded with GHO, and any other asset held in the AGD's multisig. \n\nWith GHO trading beneath $1, the Aave DAO can acquire GHO on market which will help support the peg and then use the GHO to provide funding to AGD. Distributing GHO  will promote the usage and adoption of GHO.\n\nThe Aave DAO is sending a strong signal of support for GHO by using it to reward contributors to the community. Over time, we hope all AGD and Service Provider expenses are settled in GHO.\n\nThis proposal will likely be implemented around the time the ARFC to increase [GHO's interest rate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-gho-borrow-rate/14612) is to be implemented and the issue flagged [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temporarily-pausing-gho-integration-in-aave/14626) has been resolved. Both proposals are expected to help support the GHO peg.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following assets from the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO. \n\n* 228,000 units of aEthUSDC\n* 150,000 units of aEthUSDT\n\nThe DAI allowance is to be cancelled.\n\nA GHO allowance is to be created to the value of 385,000 units (estimation of GHO acquired from swaps).\n\nThe AGD mulisig `eth:0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0` will be able to use the allowance function on `0xE4621DfD503A533f42bB5a45162eA3e5233Acd5F` to claim the GHO. \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The following address will be the recipient of the stream:\n\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nThis will allow the TokenLogic to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment for the creation of this proposal.
