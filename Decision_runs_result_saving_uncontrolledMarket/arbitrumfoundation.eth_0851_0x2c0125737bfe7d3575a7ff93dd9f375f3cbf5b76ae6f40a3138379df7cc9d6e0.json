        "body": "Deri Protocol has updated the incentive mechanism and justification based on the council’s feedback, applying only 30% of the originally proposed grant.\n\nLink to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/deri-protocol-ltipp-application-final/21566 \n\n### Requested Grant Size:\nUSD equivalent: $230,769\nARB amount: 115,385 ARB at $2\n\n### Justification\nTo determine the size of the grant we should request, we chose to benchmark against the current TVL increases that we’ve seen so far with our DERI incentives program. As detailed below, we expect to see at least a 250% increase in TVL heading to Arbitrum during the lifetime of this grant.\nWe target an average of 20% APR in ARB in our pool. To achieve this level of rewards for LPs on $5M TVL across 12 weeks, it would require the following:\nUSD equivalent = $5M * 20% *12/52 = $230,769\nARB amount = $$230,769/$2=115,385 ARB at $2\n\n\n### Council Feedback: \nGFX Feedback)\nWe are supportive for 30% of the grant spend proposed. The remaining 70%, however, is to rebate users fees paid to the applicant. This is hard to support for several reasons. Firstly, the applicant hasn’t demonstrated that fee waivers worked to increase (and then retain) volume before asking for a large amount of funding. Secondly, rebating fees paid to the applicant, as opposed to gas or third party fees, is equivalent to governance directly giving the applicant funding. Thirdly, when fees are at or approach 100% and also are fees to the applicant, this creates a perverse incentive for the applicant to encourage wash trading, sybil farming, or steering the grant funds to rebate the highest margin trades. We recommend the applicant revise and resubmit in future grants cycles with either a different distribution mechanism or significant guard rails to address the concerns above.\n\nWintermute Feedback)\nhis application was decent and scored well across various criteria. Their execution strategy was clear however, it lacked any form of justification or calculations on how they intend to reach their milestones and KPIs. Incentives for LPs were not benchmarked against market rates and they just targeted arbitrary numbers for TVL and daily trading volume.\nTheir requested grant size is on the large end and is not sufficiently justified, this is further compounded by a lack of daily users.\nLastly, we are not sure if spending 70% of this grant on trading rebates are the best use of DAO funds.\nWe will not be supporting this application.\n\nKarel Feedback)\n    \nVote AGAINST Deri's proposal.\n\nDecent proposal but unable to endorse for following reasons: (i) 70% of grant is set to go to the applicant as a fee rebate vs. end users is outside of LTIPP scope and may lead to misaligned incentives to encourage wash trading/sybiling/etc.; and (ii) insufficient justification on how they will achieve target milestones/KPIs.\n\nConsider resubmitting with just the 30% grant size focused on LP rewards and greater justification on the above.",

        "body": "Following the initial feedback of LTIPP Council, Connext would like to re-submit its LTIPP application.\n\nThe full proposal can be found here: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/connext-ltipp-application-final/21579/8\n\n The council feedback could be summarized as:\n\n* Incentives should go more towards users\n* Lack of benchmarking with other bridging projects to justify LP requests\n\n## Key facts about Connext:\n\n* Connext is positioned as a B2B2C protocol, serving apps (and indirectly their users). The protocol has experienced tremendous growth with innovations like its Restaking from Anywhere module, which allows users to restake their LRT from Arbitrum.\n* Connext facilitated and brought more than **$285m of LRTs to Arbitrum** in the last 3 months.\n* Connext volume through Arbitrum in the last 30 days was $280m\n\n![9a6944cf3c15fffb87f1cfd385e5ed1d338c6fcd_2_1035x363.png](ipfs://bafkreig6ai5hdwafn7dmsgjvvhnadl6a7buu72xnyu36ilrq5ycbz2kngi)\n    \n**Connext wants Arbitrum to succeed, and their priority remains to attract more users to bridge into Arbitrum and Restake ETH on the L2.**\n\n## Goal of the LTIPP incentives\nIncrease ETH TVL in the pools to provide better pricing for its integrated apps and their users\n\nHow (new strategy post feedback):\nincentivizing users who bridge into Arbitrum by subsidizing part of the bridging fees. This will further boost the utilization of the pools which will attract more liquidity. Higher TVL enables the best pricing when the Restaking module is used.\n\nIncentivizing users to bridge into Arbitrum has 2 benefits:\n\n1. It helps more users to bridge away from mainnet fees, onboarding them permanently onto Arbitrum\n2. It helps to rebalance the AMM pool, as the restaking activity tends to unbalance the pool in the opposite direction. Having a balanced pool means that users restaking ETH don’t incur a negative price impact.\n\n## Changes from previous requests:\n\n* **Remove any liquidity incentivization for  routers and LPs, and shift focus towards users** \n* **Refund 95% of the fees to the users bridging into Arbitrum, up to 13bps**. Fees vary depending on the origin chain (from mainnet it’s 9bps, from other L2s, 13bps) so only the actual fees incurred will be refunded.\nFees will only be subsidized to users who are onboarding to Arbitrum (from any other network), and users exiting Arbitrum will not get subsidized.\nThis is fully aligned with other crosschain protocols that saw their requests approved.\n\nThe estimate (according to the average of the last 7 days at the time of writing the original proposal) is for users to bridge 137k ETH during the pilot program.\n\nBridging fee rebate: 137,000 * 0.0013 (max fee) * 0.95 = 169 ETH\n\nTot ask: 446,472 ARB (1 ETH = 2,646.75 ARB at the time of writing)\n\nNote: pricing the ask in ARB vs ETH as the pair is less volatile\n\n## Expected milestones\n\nMonth 1: 45k ETH bridged into Arbitrum (30% of ARB distributed)\n\nMonth 2: 90k ETH bridged (60% of ARB)\n\nMonth 3: 137k ETH bridged ($100% of ARB)\n\nThe Connext team agrees to return to the Arbitrum DAO any unused ARB funds once the 12-week LTIPP program is concluded.",

In their commitment to align with Arbitrum's expectations and ecosystem, they significantly reduced their initial grant request by 50% and refined their strategic objectives to enhance trading excellence, market stability, and widespread engagement within the ecosystem.\n### Key Adjustments:\nGrant Size Reduction: From 250,000 $ARB to 125,000 $ARB to address council concerns about the original grant size and ensure responsible allocation of resources.\n\nFocused Objectives:\n\n* Trading Excellence and Activity: Allocating 40,000 $ARB to boost trading via competitions.\n* Liquidity and Market Stability: Enhancing liquidity with a targeted 40,000 $ARB, focusing on a tiered incentive structure adjusted to the current $ARB price. This includes incentives for reaching up to $2M TVL.\n* Trading Engagement: Increasing trading engagement through raffles and rebates totaling 45,000 $ARB.\n### Council Feedback Response:\n* Addressed Wintermute’s concerns on grant justification by halving the request and detailing fund distribution.\n* Integrated GMX’s suggestions for clearer grant size justification and a phased funding approach.\n* Responded to Karel’s feedback by ensuring milestones are based on tangible, proven results.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCVI’s revised proposal aligns closely with Arbitrum’s goals for growth and innovation. By scaling down the request and focusing on key performance metrics, CVI is committed to demonstrating the value and effectiveness of the project within the ecosystem.",

They have justified their grant request with a detailed execution strategy and solid KPIs. We felt like their application could have provided more detailed milestones and the distribution of the incentives is a concern as they will likely end up in the hands of a few users. However, this is a protocol with history of building on Arbitrum and we believe incentivizing its full public launch will improve Arbitrum’s competitiveness. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nThis application was good and scored decently across some criteria. Their product is unique and we like that it is built on top of existing protocols. They had some solid justification and calculation of KPIs, milestones, and goals, however, their estimations don’t really justify their grant size given the protocol’s current usage.\n\nThey could’ve also improved on their incentive design allocating some rewards to running trading competitions (which actively drive user engagement).\n\nWhile we are aware the protocol is in a private beta, looking at their Dune dashboard there is 1 active daily users indicating very low signs of adoption. We would typically be against supporting an application of this size and grant request, however, their milestone ARB unlocks provide sufficient protection for the DAO.\n\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Pear Protocol's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal that scored moderately well on the rubric. Innovative product that is composable with other Arbitrum protocols (liquidity agnostic). Despite being in closed beta, they have seen decent usage. Protocol was supposed to launch into full public launch on March 29 but have not seen any updated information on progress here. Proposal could have benefited from bettter distribution mechanisms (ie. capped per user) and more detailed milestones to also drive user metrics on top of TVL. For this proposal going to the DAO.\"",
