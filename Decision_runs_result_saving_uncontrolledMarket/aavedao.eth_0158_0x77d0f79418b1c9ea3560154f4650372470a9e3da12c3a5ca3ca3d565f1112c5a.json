        "body": "[ARFC] Remove Community Preference For Supply Cap Limits\nAuthor: @ACI\nDate: 2024-09-11\nSummary\nThis proposal suggests removing the informal supply cap restriction previously set by the community in the past vote [ARFC] Increase Community Preference For Supply Cap Limits 7.\n\nMotivation\nSupply caps for select tokens continue to be a limiting factor on growth. After the previous community preference vote to increase soft supply cap limits to 90% of total supply, we believe further adjustments are needed and feasible within a clear risk framework.\n\nThe current paradigm of limiting supply cap growth based on total supply doesn’t take into account specific nuances of networks and the fact that Aave serves as a demand driver for supply on a network as well as further liquidity.\n\nA good example is that Scroll borrow cost for WETH is currently 2.3%, which is lower than other networks and leaving money on the table for the DAO. There is over 10k wETH available liquidity with a utilization of 81%. Increasing the supply cap of weETH on that network and assuming 1.2 weETH per wETH borrowed means an expected inflow to Aave of 5k weETH collateral, which is a manageable adjustment.\n\nWe suggest regularly reviewing the supply and borrowing rates. If the WETH borrow is below or equal to 25 bps below the wstETH staking yield, we suggest risk stewards implement a cap raise for collateral LST/LRT such as wstETH & weETH.\n\nSpecification\nWe propose the community adopt the following:\n\nThe community preference for supply cap limits will be removed, with supply and borrow cap growth to be driven by the risk frameworks of risk service providers and strategic considerations for growth.\nWhere borrow rates on WETH are below expected market demand, increase supply caps on relevant collaterals to boost borrow rates, leading to further supply inflows for WETH.\nUseful Links\n[Temp Check] - Community Preference for Supply Cap Limits for LSTs\n\n[ARFC] Increase Community Preference For Supply Cap Limits 7\n\nDisclaimer\nThe ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nPublish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\nIf the ARFC snapshot passes, this community preference becomes canon and risk service providers incorporate this into current and future recommendations.\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

        "body": "## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 13/09/2024\n\n# Summary\n\n[Superlend](https://www.superlend.xyz/) is building a lending and borrowing aggregator platform that allows users to manage their positions across multiple chains and protocols, always accessing the best APRs for lending and the lowest rates for borrowing. The Superlend project was Initially conceived during the [Etherlink Accelerator in Singapore](https://medium.com/etherlink/the-future-of-defi-insights-from-dca-in-singapore-d543477cdbe6) as a lending and borrowing platform on [Etherlink](https://www.etherlink.com/).\n\nSuperlend's goals include launching their own dedicated money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, while also integrating Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem, such as on Ethereum, Base, and Polygon, into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they are planning to deploy an instance of Aave V3 that will exclusively support ETH and ETH-correlated assets (such as LRTs and LSTs), similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. These deployments and integrations will enable users to seamlessly manage their positions within the robust and secure Aave framework, while also allowing Superlend to offer innovative cross-chain liquidity management features. Additional details for the Arbitrum proposal will be provided in the future as they finalize the risk parameters and asset selection. Leveraging Aave's well-audited and secure infrastructure allows them to accelerate their development without compromising on security, avoiding the complexities and costs associated with building from scratch.\n\nIn recognition of the value provided by the Aave community, Superlend proposes a revenue-sharing model, committing to share 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave V3 codebase has established itself as a cornerstone in the DeFi ecosystem, renowned for its reliability, security, and quality. Successful projects like the Spark Protocol and RealT further affirm Aave's technology and reputation. Superlend's objectives are twofold: launching their own innovative money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, and integrating the various Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (such as those on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to deploy an instance of Aave V3 focused exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to the Lido instance that Aave has deployed on Ethereum. By doing so, they aim to provide users with a cohesive experience that leverages the strength of Aave's framework while also showcasing the unique features and innovations that Superlend can bring to the market.\n\nOne of Superlend's other motivations for deploying on Etherlink and Arbitrum-like chains using the Aave V3 codebase is to enable a feature for their aggregator that allows users to keep their USDC in the best APY protocol across chains with a single click. After extensive testing with the LayerZero-like cross-chain protocol Across+, as well as flash-loan scripts, they discovered that integrating an Aave deployment with the Portal feature activated, along with a third-party bridge provider, could allow users to move their USDC positions from Compound on Arbitrum to Aave on Optimism seamlessly. In this scenario, Superlend markets can serve as a \"temporary station\" where liquidity is parked for a few seconds during the transfer. Before making such a feature live, they would, of course, share it first in the forum and seek feedback when it's ready.\n\nSuperlend's vision aligns with deploying \"friendly\" forks of Aave V3, customized for specific use cases and ecosystems, and integrating these Aave V3 deployments by the Aave DAO as a prominent part of their aggregator. Keeping the open-source ethos at the forefront, they believe it is fair and respectful to seek the Aave community's approval first, ensuring a mutually beneficial path forward for both Aave and Superlend.\n\nAs Aave continues to explore areas like off-chain collateral and new developments such as GHO, projects like Superlend have the opportunity to add value and drive the adoption of Aave's technology. Their proposal to deploy an Aave V3 fork on Etherlink and Arbitrum represents a strategic opportunity to extend Aave's influence within the rapidly evolving cross-chain DeFi landscape. In appreciation of this opportunity, they propose a revenue-sharing model to ensure mutual benefit from this collaboration.\n\nSuperlend has confirmed plans to allocate a portion of its community token supply towards a potential airdrop or distribution specifically for stkAAVE holders, and they wish to leverage the existing set of holders and delegates, aligning with AAVE DAO's governance model. Specific details will be announced closer to the event. Currently, Superlend's priority remains product development and refinement.\n\n# Specification\n\n### Market Deployment\n\n- **Aave V3 Codebase:** Superlend will deploy their money markets on Etherlink and Arbitrum using the Aave V3 codebase. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to focus exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. Additionally, there could be a second market on Arbitrum dedicated to USDC or similar assets to support their cross-chain liquidity management feature, which would use the Aave Portal feature. These markets will operate independently from their aggregator platform but will be fully integrated within the Superlend ecosystem. These deployments are integral to both their goal of launching innovative Superlend markets and their broader strategy to integrate the existing Aave V3 markets deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (e.g., on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator.\n    - Test their proposed deployment that they have live on Etherlink testnet [here](https://testnet.superlend.xyz/).\n    - Find the addresses of their deployed contracts on the testnet [here](https://www.notion.so/Testnet-deploy-sequence-addresses-fd6c3707ece94aabab61d8498a638775?pvs=21).\n- **Revenue Sharing:** Superlend proposes sharing 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO, provided that their quarterly revenue exceeds $200,000. These contributions will be made on a quarterly basis.\n\n### Governance and Risk Management\n\n- **Governance Model:** Initially, the markets will be governed through a 5/8 multi-sig model. As the project matures, they plan to transition to a more decentralized governance structure, aligning with the principles of Aave's governance model.\n- **Risk Management:** Superlend has partnered with [ChainRisk](https://www.chainrisk.xyz/) for continuous risk parameter tuning and will onboard additional partners as needed to ensure comprehensive risk management for these markets.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on the ARFC, escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is favorable, Superlend markets will be deployed on Etherlink and Arbitrum, adhering to the revenue-sharing and governance commitments outlined.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] New Chain Deployment Framework\nAuthor: @0xTogbe - Aave Chan Initiative\nCreated: 2023-11-28\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks the community’s approval for a framework to deploy the Aave Protocol on a new blockchain.\nThis framework outlines the standardized process for any blockchain seeking to deploy on Aave Protocol. The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired.

Previous discussions around supply cap methodologies resulted in the [TEMP CHECK] vote to limit the maximum supply cap of an LST to 75% of that LST’s circulating supply. \n\nIn the year and a half since that vote, Aave has continued to grow and new liquid restaking tokens (LRT) like weETH have shown strong demand as collateral in the protocol. LRTs have also seen strong proliferation to various chains with varying levels of the total supply spread across multiple L2s. \n\nAs a result, Aave is often the main location for storing LST and LRTs on any given chain and often represents an outsized share of the total supply on any given chain. \n\nIn this new environment, Aave has becomes the main location for LRT supply on chains like Scroll and Base, while also driving LST/LRT demand on chains like Polygon PoS. Simply put, when Aave increases LST supply caps, new supply comes to fill it.\n\nLST and LRT have also had longer time in the market, with clear support for peg and asset profiles developing. Aave’s use of oracles based on the LST redemption rate and implementation of CAPO have allowed for reduced risk from the secondary market volatility. \n\nThis calls for a new limit on a collateral’s supply limit as a percentage of the total supply. This proposal suggests raising the community preference supply cap limit to 90% of the total supply. \n\n## Specification\n\n- The community preference will update from 75% of total supply to 90% of total supply.\n- Risk Parameters will be updated by Risk Service Providers based on the results of this ARFC as needed.\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[[Temp Check] - Community Preference for Supply Cap Limits for LSTs](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot passes, this community preference becomes canon and risk service providers incorporate this into current and future recommendations.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.
