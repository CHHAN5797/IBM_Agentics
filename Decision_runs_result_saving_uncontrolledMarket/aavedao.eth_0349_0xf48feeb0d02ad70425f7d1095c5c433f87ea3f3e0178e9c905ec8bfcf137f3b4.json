This service aims to further decentralize the protocol's staking exposure and actively participate in network security. ACI will operate staking nodes and run validator nodes on behalf of the DAO, enhancing the DAO's passive income and promoting a diversified staking strategy.\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning from simply acquiring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) like stETH and rETH to actively running validator nodes, \"Frontier\" represents a significant step towards greater involvement in Ethereum's network decentralization and security. \n\nFor this trial experiment, we propose to run 32 Stader minipools of 4 ETH.\n\nThis proactive approach will allow the Aave DAO to host community members in our minipools, providing them with staking exposure through ETHx.\n\n## Specification\n\nTo initiate \"Frontier,\" we propose the creation of a 2/3 multisig controlled by:\n\n- Aci.eth\n- Tokenlogic\n- Karpatkey\n\nThis multisig will be funded with 128 wETH, enabling ACI to set up 32 validator minipools on behalf of the Aave DAO.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- **Enhanced diversity**: The Aave DAO has been a pioneer in LST diversity, staking as a service can allow the DAO to increase this diversity with new ecosystems and assets that are not necessary onboarded on main pools yet.\n- **Increased alignment**: Most DAO in our ecosystem to generate a passive income on their ETH holdings acquire stETH and call it a day. The Aave DAO was the first to actually push for diversity by adding exposure to rETH.\n\nThis ARFC proposes to take our ETH-alignment a step further by being the first ever DAO actually to run nodes. by operating minipools, the DAO reinforce its synergies with other protocols such as stader, and directly increases these LST alternative market shares by allowing passive investors to acquire ETHx (1 wETH stake by the DAO allows for 3 ETH to be “staked\" via ETHx)\n\nThe Aave DAO always pioneered and led, and we hope to inspire in the ecosystem; this is why this new service is named “Frontier.” (also as a reference to Ethereum's early days).\n\n**Guarantees and Risk Mitigation:**\n\n- **Yield Guarantee:** ACI will ensure a consistent yield, equivalent to the 'regular' ETHx returns, regardless of the actual performance of the nodes. mitigating Aave DAO performance risk.\n\nFrom experience, while Yield is consistent over infinite timeframes and/or deposits, DAOs and humans have the bad habit of not having infinite time and money.\n\n“Solo staking” or “minipool staking” are needed for decentralization, but when placed on the wrong side of variance, it can lead to underwhelming returns. As Frontier grows overtime this effect will be smoothen out, until then, ACI is confident in managing financial risk, even when luck isn't on our side. We are aligned and focused on long-term outcomes.\n\n- **Slashing Protection:** ACI commits to covering any potential losses due to slashing, safeguarding the Aave DAO's wETH funds.\n- **Stader SD Token Provision:** In partnership with Stader, ACI will obtain the necessary SD tokens, enabling the DAO to engage in staking without direct exposure to the SD asset.\n\nThis will remove all need for directional exposure to the SD token for the Aave DAO. The ACI will use related rewards to participate in Stader governance aligned with its “meta-governance” mission.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If Snapshot Stage outcome is YAE, to mitigate governance burden, and reduce the amount of governance AIP, Aave Finance will be requested to include the staking multisig funding in their next treasury management AIP.\n2. Implement \"Frontier\" by setting up the validator minipools\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe ACI, independently initiates \"Frontier\" without external compensation.\nIf Frontier is approved, The ACI will receive the necessary SD tokens to operate Pools from Stader.\nThe ACI already operates Ethereum validators, Rocketpool, & stader Minipools privately.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "**Title:** [ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO\n\n**Author:** Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n**Date:** 2023-11-21\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC introduces an enhancement to the Safety Module by integrating a GHO Safety Module. This new category aims to mitigate risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events within its ecosystem. It also reduces the Safety incentives for StkAAVE and StkBPT.\n\n## Motivation\n\n[AIP-366 was adopted by governance](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/366/) to reduce the safety incentives of StkAAVE and StkBPT, but an implementation bug made the AIP execution impossible. After discussion with DAO service providers, it was decided to bundle the re-run of 366 with the creation of the GHO safety module and the StkGHO asset.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will fortify the Aave Protocol's resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversifies the Safety Module's capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module will target a liquidity pool of 9M GHO with an APR range of 12-15%, achievable with a daily emission of 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day period. The module will have a slashing rate set at 100%, meaning the entirety of the deposits could be utilized in a shortfall event, with socialized coverage among StkGHO holders. The cooldown period is adjusted to 10 days, which is suitable for a stablecoin.\n\n## Specification\n**Revised Safety Module Emissions Rate:**\n\n| Asset      | Previous Emissions | Proposed Emissions |\n|------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| StkAAVE    | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkBPT     | 550 AAVE/day      | 385 AAVE/day       |\n| StkGHO     | N/A               | 35 AAVE/day        |\n\n- **GHO Safety Module Parameters:**\n  - Target Liquidity: 9M GHO\n  - Target APR: 12-15%\n  - Emissions Period: 35 AAVE/day over a 90-day cycle\n  - Slashing Rate: 100%\n  - Cooldown Period: 10 days\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, proceed to the AIP stage.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and has not been compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

While they were initially eligible and considered for the Orbit program, they opted to explore the possibility of becoming a service provider to the DAO. However, given their recent decision to re-organize internally and re-evaluate their proposed scope as a service provider, it's appropriate to reconsider their inclusion in the Orbit program.\n\n## Specification\n\n### TokenLogic Inclusion\n\n- TokenLogic will be recognized as an official delegate within the Orbit program for a period of 90 days.\n- They will receive a monthly compensation of 5k GHO, totaling 15k GHO over the three-month period.\n\n### Funding and Emissions\n\nTokenLogic's compensation will be in line with the Orbit program's guidelines, ensuring fairness and consistency with other delegates.\n\n### Responsibilities and Conditions\n\n- TokenLogic will actively participate in Aave governance, representing their delegators and contributing to the protocol's growth.\n- If TokenLogic presents and successfully passes a proposal to become a service provider to the DAO, their Orbit funding stream will be terminated to prevent double compensation.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The inclusion of TokenLogic is based on their merits and contributions to the Aave community.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1.

We propose a strategic shift towards harnessing protocol economic activity to generate \"real yield\" through the introduction of GHO as an additional Safety Incentive. \n\nBy directing part of GHO revenue to the Safety Incentives, we aim to create a dual reward system, offering stakers both AAVE and GHO tokens. While the contribution of GHO to Safety Incentives may initially be a small fraction of the total incentives, it represents a significant step towards the protocol's maturity and sustainability. \n\nThis proposal, suggests that the governance should adjust the distribution percentage quarterly, in response to market conditions.\n\nAs the Aave protocol already generates sustainable revenue that covers service provider costs, the introduction of GHO into the Safety Incentives mix is a viable and strategic move toward diversifying Safety Incentives and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protocol.\n\n### Potential Implementation\n\nWhile technicals details of the implementation will be discussed at a potential ARFC stage of this proposal, and current stage is meant to gauge community's general interest, here's a diagram of a possible implementation, redirecting GHO revenue from Collector contract (dao treasury) to a splitter contract controlled by governance.\n\n![image|2000x1028](upload://beyTiZ0BzFAVqdN2btMmu855a04.png)\n\n### Initial Parameters\n\nWe propose to set a potential \"Gho Splitter\" contract with\n- 80% toward COLLECTOR contract (Aave DAO treasury)\n- 20% toward REWARDS_VAULT (controlling safety incentives)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage for service provider feedback and implementation discussions.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
