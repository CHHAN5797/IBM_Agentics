        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

As productive assets, LSTs are high quality collateral to borrow against. Given their high correlation to ETH, LSTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nosETH in particular is overcollateralized by design, providing in-built slashing protection and consequently an increased level of protection for the Aave protocol..\n\nAs StakeWise V3 provides solo stakers to ability to mint osETH against their own nodes, on-boarding osETH will benefit Aave, StakeWise, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and be an important step in the pursuit to diversify Ethereum staking and encourage staking from home.\n\nThe onboarding of osETH will consequently create increased osETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and StakeWise protocols, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of osETH.\n\n## Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nEthereum mainnet\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n\n[V3 Litepaper](https://stakewise.io/stakewise-v3.pdf)\n\n[V3 Docs](https://docs-v3.stakewise.io/)\n\n[What is osETH?](https://stakewise.medium.com/what-is-oseth-a-deep-dive-into-the-overcollateralized-staked-ether-token-of-stakewise-v3-part-1-37d14e28282a)\n\n[Audits - Sigma Prime and Halborn](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)\n\n[Github Page](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core)\n\nCommunities:  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Stakewise for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

KAVA’s EVM compatibility and integration will be a crucial advancement for the Aave multichain vision. The integration will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Cosmos and enables Cosmos ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through KAVA\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to be a starting point in the process of bringing Aave to the KAVA Ecosystem and aims to provide necessary details to the Aave community to consider the merits of KAVA integration. Kava has been building out the cornerstones of a solid DeFi ecosystem since mainnet launch in 2022. The key dexes in the ecosystem are Kinetix (a Uniswap v3 dex plus perpetual trading platform built by the Quickswap team from Polygon), WAGMI (protocol owned liquidity dex), and Equilibre (a ve3,3 dex). There are a few burgeoning lending protocols on the chain, but with the team’s plans to deprecate the existing leading lending protocol on the Cosmos SDK side, Kava Lend, there exists an incredible opportunity for a blue chip lending protocol like Aave to establish market dominance on the EVM side.\n\nIn addition to the market opportunity, the Kava ecosystem has an ongoing incentive program called the Kava Rise program which incentivizes protocol usage pro-rata based on TVL per protocol. Currently 1M Kava is being distributed per month to protocols pro-rata. Due to the proclivity for lending protocols to attract a significant portion of TVL in an ecosystem, Aave stands to earn the majority of these rewards. The current distribution of rewards is 1M Kava per month, and can increase pending governance approval as the ecosystem matures.\n\nThe Kava Foundation has committed to providing liquidity mining rewards of a minimum of 1M Kava guaranteed over the first year for the Aave community.\n\n*Benefits of deploying on Kava*\n\nWith the KAVA integration, Aave gets additional markets with Market Cap of $740M, ~200M of locked liquidity, native assets like ATOM, USDT, WBTC and more. KAVA itself is connected well within the Cosmos ecosystem, thus the integration will also enable the cosmos community to plug its deep $60Bn liquidity to Aave through KAVA.\n\n- Kava today is the 12th largest chain by TVL, and 9th by number of deployed protocols as per DefiLlama 2\n- Kava is an EVM built on top of the Cosmos SDK, this also facilitates bringing Cosmos assets (like ATOM) natively onto the Protocol, which is not possible on other EVMs. AAVE has the opportunity to connect trading in the Cosmos and Ethereum.\n- Kava is the largest of such an EVM chain with native Cosmos integration capabilities.\n\n*Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment*\n\nIn addition, Kava has recently garnered a partnership with Tether, as Tether selected Kava to be the native USDT distributor across the Cosmos. In other words, if a user wants an IBC denominated USDT that’s natively issued by Tether, that USDT needs to originate from Kava. In just a few short months, there has been over $150M USDT natively issued on the Kava blockchain.\n\nWETH is also available as an OFT on Kava via Stargate, and WBTC will soon be issued natively on Kava by Bitgo as well. This provides a plethora of native asset markets for Aave on Kava with deep liquidity.\n\nSome other bluechip deployments on Kava include Curve Finance, Beefy Finance, and an upcoming deployment from Yearn Finance as well.\n\nKava’s latest partnership with Tether, Bitgo, LayerZero and other DApps mentioned above signify its steady commitment to provide a top of the line DeFi ecosystem to users.\n\nOne unique benefit of an Aave v3 deployment on Kava is that Aave would be able to open up Cosmos based markets like ATOM natively on the EVM, which is currently not available on any other chain. We believe this opportunity to open up the Cosmos world to Aave presents a significant opportunity for the community.\n\n# Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Kava Foundation has done a good job of managing its treasury in this recent bear market. Currently the treasury stands at ~360M Kava. The Foundation is happy to seed liquidity in initial markets with up to 50M Kava over the first year.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Kava Rise reward program exists to reward protocols pro-rata based on the amount TVL each project has on a monthly basis. With the commitment to seed liquidity, and the market opportunity for Aave to overtake the soon-to-be deprecated existing Kava Lend protocol, Aave has a clear opportunity to establish TVL and market dominance within the Kava ecosystem, and thereby earn a significant portion of existing 1M Kava/month liquidity mining rewards.\n\nIn short, not only will Kava Foundation commit to seeding liquidity, but that seeded liquidity will also drive the flywheel of liquidity mining rewards for Aave users on Kava.\n\nRegardless of TVL, at a bare minimum, the Kava Foundation will commit to 1M Kava in liquidity mining rewards over the first year for the Aave community. It is completely up to the Aave community how it wants to use these rewards.\n\n*About Kava Rise Program*\n\nKava Rise is an on-chain reward program that rewards builders on Kava. Rewards are distributed monthly on a pro-rata basis on the amount of TVL each project has. The current reward distribution is 1M Kava per month. And this amount can change/increase based on governance as the ecosystem continues to mature.\n\nRead more about the Kava Rise program [here](https://www.kava.io/developer-rewards).\n\n# Helpful Links\n\n- Audit 1: Kava - [CertiK Skynet Project Insight](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kava)\n- Documentation: [https://docs.kava.io](https://docs.kava.io/docs/intro/)\n- Explorers: [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/kava), [Kavascan](https://kavascan.com/)\n- [KAVA Ecosystem overview](https://www.kava.io/ecosystem)\n- Kave [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chain/Kava)\n- [Kava Rise Program](https://www.kava.io/developer-rewards)\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:\n\n* Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n* Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n* Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)\n\nWe propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.\n\nIf the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: PYUSD\nContract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8\n](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)Price Feed: [0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1)\n\nChainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)\n\nWe propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap (PYUSD)|10M|\n|Borrow Cap (PYUSD)|9M|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|N/A|\n|LT|N/A|\n|Liquidation Bonus|N/A|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|80.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|8.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n|Flashloanable|No|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n\n## Liquidity and Market Cap\n\nThe PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.\n\n![|624x488](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/X-CIRWD8o7MXopvExHIFu0nv9useOuTbrMej_SoD_zJskFtFpkHtvBVietrrSEjtVsfHdoUtOlSxfRCdH2HzoIJg-VpGcZhsfebkk17eDhBoS3RKPijCFDP2D_XbMKeJ1C-jP8XeTWtOwJpPEhLC3Fk)\n\nWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.\n\n![|604x476](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WzRKS4ZDZop1OhjeZG-qnhCYb3x3zT5bT8gE6AlJAJZBjcqmWMR7HcKXnrngqWlUV3MYeZI-W3xcMHRzFx6RA-BCDF3_SrKJR4ahLDB2jVp6Rm0-12PbBSrrgD6l-D23uhk8Kogpr2lVYEIiMCYtn7U)\n\nWith peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.\n\n### Initial Supply and Borrow Caps\n\nPYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.\n\n### Variable Borrow Rate\n\nWe recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.\n\n### Borrowable in Isolation\n\nWe do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Paxos or Trident and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. . If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.
