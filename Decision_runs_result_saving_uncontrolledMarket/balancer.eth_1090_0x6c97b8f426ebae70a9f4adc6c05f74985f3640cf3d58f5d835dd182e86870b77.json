USD.AI is backed by T-bills from M^0 and from loans issued against hardware (at first it will be GPUs). \n\nThe protocol’s architecture combines delta-neutral strategies with on-chain Treasury Bill exposure, creating a synthetic dollar that maintains price stability while producing sustainable yield. This dual approach ensures that USD.AI remains pegged to $1 through arbitrage mechanisms and dynamic rebalancing, even under volatile market conditions.\n\nUSD.AI is fully non-custodial and transparent, leveraging smart contracts to manage collateral, yield generation, and redemptions. Additionally, it plans to integrate cross-chain capabilities using LayerZero technology, enabling seamless liquidity and composability across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\n\nFor more details, see the [USD.AI Documentation](https://docs.usd.ai/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nDeploying a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool for USD.AI/aGHO will significantly enhance capital efficiency and yield opportunities for liquidity providers. The integration of aGHO, which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and offers a stacked yield opportunity when paired with USD.AI.\n\nThe new **USD.AI/aGHO** pool will serve as the primary liquidity venue for USD.AI, promoting integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aGHO. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users seeking both yield and low-slippage stable swaps.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, strengthen liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for USD.AI, solidifying its role within the evolving RWA-backed stablecoin landscape.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nUSD.AI operates within the control of the core team at the moment as there is no governance token issued yet.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nUSD.AI utilizes the oracle\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nUSD.AI’s smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits to ensure the safety of user funds and protocol operations. Audit reports are publicly available in the [USD.AI Documentation](https://docs.usd.ai/technical-overview/audits).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nUSD.AI is designed to minimize centralization risks. The protocol is fully on-chain and non-custodial, and collateral management occurs transparently via smart contracts. Governance mechanisms and decentralized oracles further reduce the risk of central points of failure.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nUSD.AI is a newer protocol, with initial traction on Arbitrum and a TVL of approximately $30 million. Integrating USD.AI into Balancer v3 on Arbitrum represents an opportunity to expand its liquidity footprint and establish a prominent position as an RWA-backed stablecoin.\n\n\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **USD.AI/aGHO** pool will serve as the main liquidity hub for USD.AI on arbitrum.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: `0xA8b7683936DfF9E2F35404e61A875A76676a07B6` \n- Child gauge: `0x82FAeb834FDc9F2E3dde36C7d29cEAa2bBE24166`\n- Root gauge: `0xDB7981655Db66Aa9BD489c76323B88bD1545C7aB`\n- GaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2122\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the new **iUSD/aGHO** Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Ethereum.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [infiniFi Documentation](https://docs.infinifi.xyz/)\n- [infiniFi Website](https://www.infinifi.xyz/)\n- [GHO by Aave](https://gho.aave.com/)\n- [Aave Documentation](https://docs.aave.com/gho/)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\n**infiniFi** is a decentralized fractional reserve staking system designed to improve financial stability and capital efficiency while aligning depositor incentives. It allows users to mint **iUSD**, a high-yield stablecoin backed by liquid and locked collateral. Depositors can choose lock durations to earn higher returns, enabling automated maturity laddering of reserves and reducing duration mismatch risks—challenges inherent in traditional banking.\n\nKey features of iUSD include:\n\n- **Fractional Reserve Design**: Achieves higher yield across depositor segments by combining liquid and locked capital into duration-matched strategies.\n- **Depositor-Driven Allocation**: Users determine how their funds are deployed, based on preferred liquidity timelines.\n- **Yield Optimization**: Liquid deposits earn top DeFi rates, while locked positions gain amplified returns.\n- **Blockchain Transparency**: Fully on-chain and governed by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and trustlessness.\n\naGHO, on the other side of the pair, represents GHO deposited into Aave’s yield-bearing Prime instance. It combines the stability and overcollateralization of GHO with passive native yield from Aave.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntroducing a gauge for the iUSD/aGHO Composable Stable pool enhances liquidity and accessibility between two distinct yet complementary stablecoins:\n\n- **Yield Synergy**:  aGHO is yield-bearing by design while iUSD is the vanilla stablecoin of infinifi ecosystem, it earns points rather than being yield bearing. This pool offers users a yield-maximized stable pair, ideal for liquidity providers and DAOs seeking low-risk yield.\n- **Deepens iUSD Utility**: Adding GHO as a trading pair on Balancer offers DeFi-native arbitrage and integration potential.\n- **Supports iUSD Distribution**: Balancer’s infrastructure offers a trusted, programmable venue to introduce iUSD to more DeFi participants.\n- **Composable Collateral**: A deep and efficient pool can support integrations with leverage protocols, yield vaults, and synthetic markets.\n\nA gauge will accelerate TVL growth and market usage, establishing this pool as the primary DeFi liquidity venue for iUSD.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\ninfiniFi is governed by smart contracts with a future pathway toward DAO-managed control over key parameters and reserve deployment logic. Depositors drive asset allocation through bonding preferences, creating transparent and market-driven governance outcomes.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\niUSD leverages on-chain DeFi markets such as Aave and Compound for asset yields. Pricing for redemptions and collateral values is computed via verifiable on-chain mechanisms. The system currently does not rely on off-chain oracles but may integrate oracle feeds (e.g., Chainlink) for advanced features.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nLink to the audits [here](https://docs.infinifi.xyz/Security-1fb44c414f3680d6b5ccfccefdf2c5cb)\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\ninfiniFi is non-custodial and fully on-chain. All deposits, locks, and allocations are governed by smart contracts. There is no reliance on centralized intermediaries or off-chain execution, minimizing centralization risks.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nThis is a new Balancer v3 pool launching to support the growth of iUSD and aGHO liquidity. iUSD is actively used within the infiniFi protocol, and this Balancer integration represents the first major external liquidity venue for the asset. aGHO is already in use within Aave and Balancer GHO initiatives.\n\n- [Balancer Pool Link](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) (To be added upon deployment)\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThis pool will serve as the primary DeFi liquidity hub for iUSD while enhancing GHO ecosystem stability and utility. The pairing supports passive yield strategies, arbitrage, and future integrations across lending protocols and structured product layers.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: `0x733F2D3f66d3F41bde65d95321A19a1e55BB5470` \n- Gauge(address): `0xac681deb529b49b5a563fbf0dcccb95d5bb7cdb0` \n- GaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

It allows users to mint iUSD, a high-yield stablecoin backed by liquid and locked collateral. Depositors can choose lock durations to earn higher returns, enabling automated maturity laddering of reserves and reducing duration mismatch risks—challenges inherent in traditional banking.\n\nKey features of iUSD include:\n\n* **Fractional Reserve Design**: Achieves higher yield across depositor segments by combining liquid and locked capital into duration-matched strategies\n* **Depositor-Driven Allocation**: Users determine how their funds are deployed, based on preferred liquidity timelines\n* **Yield Optimization**: Liquid deposits earn top DeFi rates, while locked positions gain amplified returns\n* **Blockchain Transparency**: Fully on-chain and governed by smart contracts, ensuring transparency and trustlessness\n\nsiUSD represents the staked version of iUSD, designed to capture native senior tranche yield and additional protocol incentives while maintaining the stability characteristics of the underlying iUSD token.\n\n### Ethena Protocol\n\nEthena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the 'Internet Bond'.\n\nEthena's synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.\n\nsUSDe is the staked version of USDe which earns yield from the protocol's delta-neutral hedging strategies and has already seen extensive adoption across DeFi with over $100M in liquidity on various platforms.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntroducing a gauge for the siUSD/sUSDe Composable Stable pool creates synergies between two innovative yield-bearing stablecoin ecosystems:\n\n* **Yield Synergy**: Both siUSD and sUSDe are yield-bearing by design, offering users a high-yield stable pair ideal for liquidity providers and DAOs seeking low-risk yield strategies\n* **Enhanced Utility**: Pairing siUSD with the established sUSDe creates immediate utility and arbitrage opportunities for both assets\n* **DeFi Integration**: Deep liquidity enables integrations with leverage protocols, yield vaults, and synthetic markets\n* **Composable Infrastructure**: Balancer's programmable infrastructure provides the ideal venue for these sophisticated stablecoin protocols\n\nA gauge will accelerate TVL growth and establish this pool as a primary DeFi liquidity venue for both protocols' users.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\n**infiniFi**: Governed by smart contracts with a future pathway toward DAO-managed control over key parameters and reserve deployment logic. Depositors drive asset allocation through bonding preferences, creating transparent and market-driven governance outcomes.\n\n**Ethena**: Currently operates with a multi-signature wallet featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to token holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\n**infiniFi**: Leverages on-chain DeFi markets such as Aave and Compound for asset yields. Pricing for redemptions and collateral values is computed via verifiable on-chain mechanisms. The system currently does not rely on off-chain oracles but may integrate oracle feeds (e.g., Chainlink) for advanced features.\n\n**Ethena**: The system relies on real-time price feeds from multiple sources including CeFi exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit), Pyth, and Redstone for managing delta-hedging positions and ensuring system integrity.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\n**infiniFi**: Has undergone comprehensive security audits by leading firms including [Certora, Spearbit, and Cantina](https://docs.infinifi.xyz/Security-1fb44c414f3680d6b5ccfccefdf2c5cb)\n\n**Ethena**: Has undergone security audits by Spearbit & Cantina\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\n**infiniFi**: Non-custodial and fully on-chain. All deposits, locks, and allocations are governed by smart contracts. There is no reliance on centralized intermediaries or off-chain execution, minimizing centralization risks.\n\n**Ethena**: While the protocol uses centralized exchanges for hedging, the core protocol remains decentralized with transparent on-chain mechanics and plans for full decentralization.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nThis represents a new innovative pairing between two established yield-bearing stablecoin protocols. sUSDe has demonstrated strong market adoption with significant liquidity across DeFi platforms, while siUSD brings additional utility through infiniFi's fractional reserve mechanics.\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThis pool will serve as a primary DeFi liquidity hub for both siUSD and sUSDe, enabling:\n\n* Enhanced yield strategies for liquidity providers\n* Arbitrage opportunities between the two ecosystems\n* Composable infrastructure for future protocol integrations\n* Deepened liquidity for both token ecosystems\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\n**Pool Address**: `0x071828ACC755314E687448703775F22194f56867`\n\n* **gauge(address)**: `0xB1EFE3B01D5Cf28Bd923de3E5a567621588F435a`\n* **gaugeType(string)**: Ethereum",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2049\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the new **USDN/aGHO** Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Ethereum.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [SmarDex Website](https://smardex.io/)\n- [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral)\n- [SmarDex GitHub](https://github.com/SmarDex-Ecosystem)\n- [SmarDex Twitter](https://twitter.com/SmarDex)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nSmarDex introduces **USDN**, a fully decentralized synthetic dollar designed to maintain a stable value around $1 while providing yield to its holders. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by centralized reserves, USDN employs a delta-neutral strategy through a structured product mechanism. This approach balances long and short positions within the protocol to stabilize USDN's value and generate returns for participants.\n\nKey features of USDN include:\n\n- **Decentralization**: Operates entirely on-chain without reliance on centralized entities.\n- **Yield Generation**: Utilizes a rebase mechanism to distribute yields directly to holders' wallets.\n- **Delta-Neutral Strategy**: Maintains stability by balancing leveraged long positions against the vault's holdings.\n- **No Custodial Risk**: Users interact directly with smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntegrating USDN with aGHO in a Balancer v3 Composable Stable pool offers several advantages:\n\n- **Enhanced Capital Efficiency**: aGHO, being GHO deposited into Aave's Prime instance, accrues native yield, reducing the need for additional incentives.\n- **Strengthened Liquidity**: Establishes a primary liquidity venue for USDN, promoting seamless integrations with DeFi protocols utilizing aGHO.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader integrations across DeFi for USDN.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nSmarDex uses \"Privileged functions\" which allow Multisigs to have an overview about all important functions of the protocol. \n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nThe USDN protocol relies on a dual-oracle system, utilizing both Pyth and Chainlink, to obtain accurate price feeds. This redundancy ensures resilience against potential oracle failures and maintains the integrity of the protocol's operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nSmarDex's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral/risks).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nThere is no governance; the team manages all operations. Some contracts are renounced, while others are controlled by a 3/5 multisig\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nAs a new Balancer v3 pool, the USDN/aGHO pair aims to establish itself as a significant liquidity venue for USDN. The integration with Aave's aGHO token is expected to enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **USDN/aGHO** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for USDN, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize GHO. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and expanding USDN's utility across the Ethereum ecosystem. With GHO being the cornerstone asset for swap in Balancer v3 it will ensure efficient swap throughout the DEX.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: 0x950682e741abd1498347a93b942463af4ec7132b\n- Gauge: 0x9798995a042973d9705a4f0fea691a4541d13b43\n- GaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "title": "[BIP-834] Enable Aave Boosted USDf/aGHO Gauge on Balancer v3 Ethereum",
        "author": "0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516",
        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2054\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal to add gauge support for the new **USDf/aGHO** Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Ethereum.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [Falcon Finance Website](https://falcon.finance/)\n- [Falcon Finance Documentation](https://docs.falcon.finance/)\n- [Falcon Finance GitHub](https://github.com/falconfinance)\n- [Falcon Finance Twitter](https://twitter.com/falconstable)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nFalcon Finance is a next-generation synthetic dollar protocol that enables users to mint USDf, an overcollateralized synthetic dollar, by depositing a diverse set of collateral assets, including stablecoins like USDC, USDT, DAI, and volatile assets such as ETH, BTC and some more exotic ones. The protocol employs a dual-token system comprising USDf and sUSDf, where USDf serves as the foundational unit of account, and sUSDf is a yield-bearing token obtained by staking USDf.\n\nUSDf maintains its peg through a combination of delta-neutral trading strategies and cross-market arbitrage opportunities, ensuring stability even during market turbulence. The protocol supports multiple minting mechanisms, including Classic Mint and Innovative Mint, catering to various user risk profiles and strategies.\n\nFalcon Finance operates with a focus on sustainable yield generation, making it a robust solution for users seeking stable, on-chain liquidity without relinquishing exposure to their underlying assets.\n\nFor more details, see the [Falcon Finance Documentation](https://docs.falcon.finance/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning to a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool for USDf/aGHO will significantly enhance capital efficiency and yield opportunities for liquidity providers. The integration of aGHO, which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and provides additional yield streams.\n\nThe new **USDf/aGHO** pool will serve as the primary liquidity venue for USDf on Balancer, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aGHO. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users interacting with Aave-based strategies.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for USDf, solidifying its role within the synthetic dollar ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nFalcon Finance's governance framework is designed to ensure transparency and community involvement. While TGE has not happened yet, the core team is shipping fast and efficiently at the moment and will update the governance framework when the token is live.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nUSDf has its own [Chainlink data feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/usdf-usd) and has permissioned mint and redemption processes to protect the peg.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nFalcon Finance's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [Falcon Finance Documentation](https://docs.falcon.finance/).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nFalcon Finance is designed to minimize centralization risks. \n\n### 5. Market History\n\nAs a new Balancer v3 pool, the USDf/aGHO pair aims to establish itself as a significant liquidity venue for USDf. The integration with Aave's aGHO token is expected to enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **USDf/aGHO** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for USDf, facilitating seamless integrations with lending protocols. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and expanding USDf's utility across the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: `0x6c5972311191097D002E804A9Bf97C96C54059ed` \n- Gauge(address): `0x52d28dff7759ca78978954ebabf87481bd5cf8f0` \n- GaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
