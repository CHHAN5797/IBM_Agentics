It is ranked number 6 on the Avalanche C-Chain in terms of TVL chain and currently controls more than 500k AVAX (~$23M at current market prices).\n\nWe believe there is currently very large underserved demand for borrowing AVAX against ggAVAX, as ggAVAX is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche. The APYs currently range between 7% and 8%, which is on the order of 33% more yield than any existing competitors on Avalanche. \n\nBeing the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche makes ggAVAX perfect for being a collateral asset, especially for those who seek leveraged exposure to native AVAX yields.\n\n \n![dd93fbd27bc1aac727035529eb5ff6253f57edc8.png](ipfs://bafkreibcfworgked4rc5maanvobvklqy6rmwchfk7rjyoswvyd2chpzsbu)\n    \n\n\nThis yield is achieved through a mix of no protocol fees, running validators instead of utilizing delegation mechanisms, and generating MEV yield from positive market interactions (see dashboard for more details: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK)). \n\nThere is currently more than ~80k AVAX in the ggAVAX-AVAX pools across Balancer and Wombat, making it the most liquid Avalanche LST relative to its size.\n\n \n![8867ec44b2d0dc326eaf4b928b7d7c889eb5f113.png](ipfs://bafkreig3f2xualvcqedjubvgg66tj3jwfkccocvm53l5dc5xtmmo6r5px4)\n    \n\n\nBesides the deep on-chain liquidity, ggAVAX allows users to redeem ggAVAX for underlying AVAX at an internal rate and with no fees. These redemptions are instant as long as there is enough AVAX in the ggAVAX smart contract to facilitate them.\n\nGoGoPool is backed by the Avalanche Foundation and industry-leading investors. In 2022, It raised $7.5M in two rounds [led by Framework Ventures and Coinfund and](https://www.theblock.co/post/166498/gogopool-raises-5-million-to-provide-decentralized-staking-on-avalanche?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) with participation from Silverstone Ventures, Fintech Collective, and Avalaunch. \n\nThe protocol has been [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/GoGoPool%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Kudelski Security](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f90a8443126c2ee50f4c4e/643ee88bf91b375b39ba2613_Kudelski_multisig_labs_report_1.1.pdf) with an additional [Code4rena](https://docs.gogopool.com/audits/code4rena-audit) audit contest. It also has an ongoing [bug bounty program with Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/gogopool/).\n\n### Benefits of listing ggAVAX\n\nListing of ggAVAX on AAVE would create additional demand for borrowing AVAX (in E-Mode) and other assets. Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.\n\nCurrently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nAave V3 on Avalanche.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments\n\nGoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.\n\nAfter the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults. \n\nThese and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general. Note that we have already had preliminary talks with a number of protocols on this subject.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://www.gogopool.com/) \n\n[Github](https://github.com/multisig-labs/)\n\n[Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK) \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogopool_)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gogopool.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:\n\n* Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n* Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n* Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)\n\nWe propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.\n\nIf the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: PYUSD\nContract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8\n](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)Price Feed: [0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1)\n\nChainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)\n\nWe propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap (PYUSD)|10M|\n|Borrow Cap (PYUSD)|9M|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|N/A|\n|LT|N/A|\n|Liquidation Bonus|N/A|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|80.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|8.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n|Flashloanable|No|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n\n## Liquidity and Market Cap\n\nThe PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.\n\n![|624x488](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/X-CIRWD8o7MXopvExHIFu0nv9useOuTbrMej_SoD_zJskFtFpkHtvBVietrrSEjtVsfHdoUtOlSxfRCdH2HzoIJg-VpGcZhsfebkk17eDhBoS3RKPijCFDP2D_XbMKeJ1C-jP8XeTWtOwJpPEhLC3Fk)\n\nWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.\n\n![|604x476](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WzRKS4ZDZop1OhjeZG-qnhCYb3x3zT5bT8gE6AlJAJZBjcqmWMR7HcKXnrngqWlUV3MYeZI-W3xcMHRzFx6RA-BCDF3_SrKJR4ahLDB2jVp6Rm0-12PbBSrrgD6l-D23uhk8Kogpr2lVYEIiMCYtn7U)\n\nWith peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.\n\n### Initial Supply and Borrow Caps\n\nPYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.\n\n### Variable Borrow Rate\n\nWe recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.\n\n### Borrowable in Isolation\n\nWe do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Paxos or Trident and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. . If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n**Title:** [ARFC] Onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Ethereum\n**Author:** Ether.fi & ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n**Date:** 2024-02-27\n\n---\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe current ARFC seeks to add [Ether.fi](http://Ether.fi) Liquid Restaking Token weETH to Aave V3 Ethereum, after the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546) and [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e).\n\nThe intention behind this initiative is to enhance the diversity of assets on Aave and bolster liquidity within the ecosystem.\n\n### Motivation:\n\neETH is an LRT that allows users to stake their ETH, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through native restaking on EigenLayer. As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi 1](http://ether.fi/) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) stands as the pioneering decentralized and non-custodial delegated staking protocol featuring an LRT (eETH). A notable feature of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is the control it provides stakers over their keys. The team behind the protocol is guided by the following principles:\n\n1. Decentralization is the foremost objective. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is unwavering in its commitment to maintain the protocol's non-custodial and decentralized nature, ensuring that stakers always have control over their ETH.\n2. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) operates as a legitimate business with a sustainable revenue model, with the team dedicated to its long-term success. There is no place for deceptive or unsustainable financial practices.\n3. [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is committed to always acting in the best interest of the Ethereum community. In the event of any missteps, the team at [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) will take responsibility and swiftly rectify the situation.\n\nRisks:\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)  and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.\n\nUsers are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH. \n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.\n\n### Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nweETH: [0xCd5fE23C85820F7B72D0926FC9b05b43E359b7ee](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcd5fe23c85820f7b72d0926fc9b05b43e359b7ee)\n\n| Risk Parameters | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (weETH) | 8000 |\n| Borrow Cap (weETH) | 800 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72.50% |\n| LT | 75.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-correlated |\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n[Ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboarding-weeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/16546)\n\n[TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xffe122a2fb0b34e713b7bb8e74e943b35c6cb298bafc4e50c464b62167e3246e)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. The co-author is a team member [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n3.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum \nAuthor: Kelp DAO & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-02-20\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 470 Mn+ (~168k Eth) TVL\n- 18K restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH and sfrxETH and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >12 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $4 Mn\n    - [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-67/deposit) - $4 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x64939a882c7d1b096241678b7a3a57ed19445485) - $3.2 Mn\n    - [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x1b06f8fc94b95b6a8075aa1dcf12e69c70144c52?chain=1) - $0.9 Mn\n- $3.5 Mn average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 17th Feb)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nExchange rate is calculated basis the formula:\n\nrseth / eth = [(asset amount in protocol * asset price in ETH)rsETH total supply]\n\nrsEth relies on multiple contract exchange rates for:\n\n1. stEth: As this is a rebasing token, the balance of stETH changes over time and the asset price is taken as 1stETH = 1 ETH.\n\n2. ETHx: Asset price is taken from getExchangeRate( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf5EA1b38380f6aF39068375516Daf40Ed70D299#readProxyContract\n\n3. Sfrxeth: Asset price is taken from pricePerShare( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/token/0xac3e018457b222d93114458476f3e3416abbe38f\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nAs of today, the only way to exit rsETH is via DEXs. KelpDAO is going to enable withdrawals by mid-March 2024 after which users can withdraw Eth or any LSTs via KelpDAO dapp.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n- Contract Address: [0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n- [Github Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.

        "body": "---\n**Title:** [ARFC] Onboard osETH to Aave V3 on Ethereum \n**Author:** ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n**Date:** 2024-03-11\n\n---\n## Summary\n\nThis is a ARFC proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s new over-collateralized staked ETH token, osETH, on AAVE V3 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLiquid staking tokens (LSTs) have proven to be popular collateral assets on Aave, with Lido’s stETH the largest Reserve across all Aave deployments and rETH quickly reaching its supply caps. As productive assets, LSTs are high quality collateral to borrow against. Given their high correlation to ETH, LSTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nosETH in particular is overcollateralized by design, providing in-built slashing protection and consequently an increased level of protection for the Aave protocol…\n\nAs StakeWise V3 provides solo stakers to ability to mint osETH against their own nodes, on-boarding osETH will benefit Aave, StakeWise, and the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole, and be an important step in the pursuit to diversify Ethereum staking and encourage staking from home.\n\nThe onboarding of osETH will consequently create increased osETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and StakeWise protocols, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of osETH.\n\n## Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nEthereum mainnet\n\n## Specification:\n\nosETH contract address:\n\n[0xf1C9acDc66974dFB6dEcB12aA385b9cD01190E38](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf1C9acDc66974dFB6dEcB12aA385b9cD01190E38)\n\n| Risk Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Emode | No |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| Stable Borrow | No |\n| Enable Borrow | Yes |\n| Enable Collateral | Yes |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 71% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 76% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n| Supply Cap | 15000 osETH |\n| Borrow Cap | 1000 osETH |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 45% |\n| Base | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 7% |\n| Slope2 | 300% |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-oseth-to-aave-v3-on-ethereum-pool/15636)\n\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xef2124e2d2e756649f133338c2a876f61be19b7a5ace7df58326f1df034c6d5d)\n\n[Website](https://www.stakewise.io/)\n\n[V3Litepaper](https://www.stakewise.io/stakewise-v3.pdf)\n\n[Audits](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core/tree/main/audits)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/stakewise/v3-core)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io)\n[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/StakeWise)\n[Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Stakewise for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to AIP stage\n4.
