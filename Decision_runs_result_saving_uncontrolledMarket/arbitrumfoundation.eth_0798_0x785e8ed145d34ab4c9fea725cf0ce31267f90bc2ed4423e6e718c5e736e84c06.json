        "body": "# Abstract\nSynthetix requests an 8-week extension for its LTIP grant to align with the launch of Perps Multi-Collateral and distribute 900k ARB in trading fee rebates. This extension will run from September 16th to November 16th, 2024 (edit: with Snapshot ending dates) aligning the deployment of the remaining grant funds with a major product launch.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum community should implement this extension to maximize the impact of the originally approved grant, which targeted LP & stablecoin incentives. By aligning the distribution with the launch of our Arbitrum-exclusive Multi-Collateral Perps feature, we can ensure greater engagement, trading volume, and overall ecosystem growth.\n\n# Rationale\n\nSynthetix has experienced unforeseen delays in its deployment of Synthetix Perps on Arbitrum. We originally expected to launch by late July, to align with one month of Perps fee rebates. However, due to audits and other factors, and to ensure the top performance of our Arbitrum-exclusive multi-collateral perps feature, we’ve been unable to hit these targets. As a result, we’ve not utilized 900k ARB from our proposal and would like to seek an extension.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Multi-Collateral Perps : A feature allowing users to margin with ETH, BTC, and USDx for perpetual futures trading on Arbitrum with Synthetix Perps.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThe extension will utilize the remaining 900k ARB tokens from our original proposal for trading fee rebates. These rebates will be distributed over 8 weeks, coinciding with the launch of Multi-Collateral Perps. This approach ensures:\n\n1. Full implementation of the Multi-Collateral Perps feature\n2. Complete integration with frontend partners, particularly Kwenta as our launch partner\n3. Enhanced capital efficiency with multiple margin options, new trading \nstrategies, trading types, etc.\n4. Improved user experience and market competitiveness as an Arbitrum exclusive launch\n\n# Steps to Implement\n1. Launch Multi-Collateral Perps feature on Arbitrum (this week)\n2. Begin distribution of trading fee rebates\n3. Monitor and report on the impact of the rebates and new feature\n\n# Timeline\n* Start Date: September 16th\n* End Date: November 16th\n* Total 8 week program from starting date. (Original TBD dates have been edited based on Snapshot timing)\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThe extension utilizes the remaining 900,000 ARB tokens from the originally approved 2 million ARB grant. Over the 8-week period, this amount will be fully distributed as trading fee rebates as per our original LTIP grant.\n\n* Total Cost: 900,000 ARB tokens\n* Weekly Distribution: 112,500 ARB tokens (900,000 / 8 weeks)\n\nNo additional funds are being requested beyond the original grant allocation.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWe have been working with the LTIP Council, @Matt_StableLab, and others to work out the best path to request this extension, and we started requesting information & guidance on July 21st.\n\nWe’ve also posted about our proposed plans in our original LTIP [thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023) which included options on how to best proceed.\n\nWe plan to post this on Snapshot, not Tally, next week with the help of @krst, as it does not utilize any additional funds. Any additional comments before this time would be very helpful. Thank you all!",

        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to extend the deadline for protocols in both STIP and the backfund proposal. Should this proposal pass, the new deadline for protocols to distribute ARB to users would be March 29th. 2024. Since backfunded protocols will experience significant delays to the start of their streams, this proposal aims to have backfunded streams continue until March 15th, 2024. These timeline modifications will help to ensure all protocols have enough time to distribute ARB to users.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe [Proposal to Backfund Successful STIP Proposals](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13413460212244439965325761903593975061091934953503684497413508380387288651335?chart=2) has recently passed quorum on Tally and will soon commence. The backfund proposal was inappropriately dated to end on January 31st, 2024. As it will likely take several weeks for back-funded protocols to pass KYC, this will only leave around 6 weeks for these protocols to distribute 16 weeks' worth of incentives. This extension proposal aims to continue the streams for these protocols until March 15th, 2024, and allow these protocols to continue incentivizing users until March 29th, 2024. This extension will allow these protocols closer to the full 16 weeks to distribute their ARB incentives to users.\n\nAdditionally, due to extreme variations in KYC timing of the original STIP grantees, some protocols were given much shorter timelines to distribute their ARB incentives. This extension proposal also offers the option to extend the STIP deadline to distribute ARB to users until March 29th, 2024. This will ensure all STIP protocols are given adequate time to distribute their ARB. This however will not change their hedgey stream disbursement dates as the multisig has already started these streams.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe grant funds for both STIP and the Backfund proposal are held by the incentives multisig as stated in the two previous proposals. However, these funds belong to the DAO and the multisig has agreed to follow the DAO's directions. This proposal signals to the multisig if the DAO would like to extend the timelines for STIP and the backfund grant. If this proposal passes the multisig will extend the backfunded protocols’ streams to end on March 15th, 2024, and will allow these protocols to continue distributing their ARB to users until March 29th, 2024. Additionally, should the DAO choose, this proposal could signal to the multisig to allow any original STIP protocols to continue distributing incentives to users until March 29th, 2024 without halting their streams.\n\nThese extensions will ensure that protocols’ incentive distributions to users are not rushed. This will help even the playing field for those who took longer to pass KYC. It will allow the DAO to get more accurate data on the success of these programs.\n\n## Key Terms -\n\nSTIP - The full Short Term Incentives program proposal can be seen [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/92535731414466076465748260699234569033779695239254902723866669906112586724812?chart=2)\n\nBackfund Proposal - The full backfund proposal can be seen [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/13413460212244439965325761903593975061091934953503684497413508380387288651335?chart=2)\n\nOriginal Timeline - Originally both STIP and the backfund were to end by January 31st\n\nHedgey Stream Disbursements - The ARB protocols receive biweekly from the multisig\n\nGrant Distributions - The ARB protocols award to users as incentives\n\nIncentives Multisig - The 5/9 multisig that holds the funds for both Incentives programs. Details can be seen [here](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/92535731414466076465748260699234569033779695239254902723866669906112586724812?chart=2)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Extended Backfunded Protocol Timeline\n\nProtocols included in the backfund proposal will have their streams started in batches similar to STIP based on the time they pass KYC. These protocols will also receive disbursements from the multisig using hedgey streams every two weeks.\n\nThe last disbursement date will be March 15th, 2024. Protocols will then have two weeks to finish distributing ARB incentives to users with a deadline of March 29th, 2024.\n\n### Extended STIP Protocol Timeline\n\nProtocols included in the original STIP will have until March 29th, 2024 to finish distributing ARB incentives to users.\n\nThese protocols do not have to extend their distribution schedules until this deadline. Many STIP protocols already have distribution plans in progress that end earlier than March 29th. Protocols may choose to keep their initial plans and finish distributing rewards earlier than March 29th.\n\nProtocols that do wish to extend to the March 29th deadline will be expected to update their distribution plans in their biweekly updates and maintain consistency with their fund usage as expressed in their grant application.\n\nThe hedgey streams for the STIP protocols will not be adjusted as they have already been initiated by the multisig.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nThe multisig would initiate streams for all backfunded protocols to end on March 15th, 2024 given that the backfund proposal passes and these protocols pass KYC and sign grant agreements.\n\nSTIP protocols that wish to adjust their distribution timelines will need to provide updated timelines in their next biweekly update.\n\nBackfunded protocols will also need to provide new distribution schedules that meet the March 29th Deadline.\n\nStableLab will work with the incentives multisig, foundation, protocols, and DAO to help coordinate KYC confirmation, stream initiation, stream monitoring, biweekly updates, and community questions throughout the process.\n\n## Timeline\n\nMarch 15th, 2024 - Backfunded protocols receive their last stream disbursement\n\nMarch 29th, 2024 - Deadline for STIP / backfunded protocols to finish distributing ARB to users\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nThere is no additional to cost the DAO associated with this proposal\n\n## Voting Options\n\n1. Extend deadline for both STIP and Backfunded\n2. Extend deadline only for backfunded protocols\n3. Do not extend either deadline\n4. Abstain",

        "author": "0xB933AEe47C438f22DE0747D57fc239FE37878Dd1",
        "body": "# Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks a 12 weeks extension (until November 30\\) of the Pyth Network’s [previously approved LTIPP grant](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003).\n\nInitially, the Pyth Network was allocated 1,000,000 ARB through the LTIPP process. To date, we have utilized approximately 75,042 ARB over the 12-week duration of the program.\n\nWe are requesting to retain 174,958 ARB, bringing our total expenditure to 250,000 ARB out of the original 1,000,000, until the new grant programs are established.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWe want to highlight that incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods, such as the Pyth oracle, typically do not yield immediate results. The impact from making such incentives available to DeFi often unfolds over weeks or even months.\n\nFor existing DeFi applications, switching to a new oracle involves significant effort and may require a new audit. Similarly, expanding from other chains to Arbitrum can be more time-consuming than anticipated, as illustrated by the Synthetix case [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/synthetix-ltipp-application-final/22023/20).\n\nThanks to the initial LTIPP program, Arbitrum dApps had the ability to build robust oracle systems covering over 500 assets, including cryptocurrencies, FX, stocks, ETFs, and commodities. This advancement has eliminated outdated on-chain price updates and high costs, reinforcing Arbitrum’s position as a premier layer for DeFi. This progress empowers developers to create cutting-edge applications without constraints. This extension aims to keep the momentum and further empower potential new entrants like Synthetix to deliver a best-in-class protocol.\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe proposed extension of the Pyth Network’s LTIPP grant is designed to further cultivate a thriving and innovative DeFi ecosystem on Arbitrum. The LTIPP program has already proven its effectiveness, with Pyth price updates on-chain increasing by 2-3 times and peaking at nearly 10 times the previous levels, reaching over 70,000 updates on July 14\\.\n\nBefore the program began, the total value secured by the Pyth oracle on Arbitrum was just over 43,000 ETH. This figure has since risen to 52,500 ETH, reflecting an increase of more than 20%.\n\nPyth has also enabled over $16.1 billion in trading volume on various Arbitrum decentralized perpetual exchanges during June and July (with August data pending). This underscores the benefits for applications powered by Pyth Network: protocols using Pyth have experienced, including increased total value locked (TVL), higher trading volumes, and more frequent price updates driven by a growing number of applications utilizing Pyth.\n\nThe request for a 12-week extension, with a reduced ARB allocation, is part of our commitment towards responsible resource management commitment to responsible resource management while continuing to support the long-term success of applications built on Arbitrum that leverage Pyth. By covering the gas costs for using the Pyth oracle, the network has enabled more developers to create robust DeFi applications without the burden of high operational expenses.\n\nThis strategy strengthens Arbitrum’s position as a premier platform for DeFi innovation, where developers can access over 500 price feeds without financial or technical constraints.\n\nIt’s important to understand that the impact of incentives for infastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth price oracle are not immediate: it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nFurthermore, it’s important to recognize that the impact of incentives for infrastructure protocols and public goods like the Pyth oracle is not immediate; it often takes weeks or even months to materialize.\n\nThis proposal, aims to build on the momentum generated by the initial LTIPP program, ensuring the continued growth and expansion of the Arbitrum ecosystem as new grant strategies are developed and implemented.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* On-demand or pull oracle: An oracle network where anyone can permissionlessly trigger price updates on-chain by doing an Arbitrum tx\n\n# Specifications\n\n* 13 weeks duration  \n* 175,000 ARB\n\nThe proposed extension duration is similar to that of the previous LTIPP program—12 weeks versus 13 weeks (including retroactive rebates for the end of August). However, the amount of ARB tokens requested for gas rebates has increased from 75,000 ARB to 175,000 ARB.\n\nThis increase reflects an anticipated rise in activity and associated costs, estimated at approximately 133%. The launch of Synthetix’s Multi-Collateral Perps on Arbitrum is expected to drive a substantial increase in the number of price updates triggered on-chain. For context, Synthetix currently triggers around 1,000 daily updates on Optimism and between 3,000 and 5,000 daily updates on Base—both without additional incentives in place.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nIf the Arbitrum DAO approves this extension, no additional work or involvement will be required from the DAO itself. The responsibility for managing the funds and continuing the program would remain entirely with the Pyth Data Association.\n\nAs during the initial 12 weeks of the LTIPP, the Pyth Data Association would continue reimbursing dApps for gas costs every two weeks. Additionally, we would maintain our practice of providing bi-weekly updates on the Arbitrum forum to ensure transparency and accountability. Our latest report is available [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-bi-weekly-update-26-august-2024/26525), and we are open to including even more detailed data and information in these reports if needed.\n\nSince this is an extension of an already approved grant, no additional legal work is necessary. The Pyth Data Association has already completed KYC and signed the grant agreement with the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe LTIPP program officially ended on August 26, and until this extension proposal is approved, the Pyth Data Association has paused reimbursing the gas costs incurred by dApps during this period.\n\nIf approved, the extension would be applied retroactively, starting from the end of the LTIPP program on August 26. This means that, depending on the timing of the Snapshot vote, there could be up to 2-3 weeks of retroactive gas rebates.\n\nThe proposed extension would conclude on November 30, 2024.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThe cost to the Arbitrum DAO can be seen as an opportunity cost of 174,958 ARB, or potentially even less. Originally, the DAO approved a grant of 1,000,000 ARB—funds that were effectively budgeted and allocated—of which only 75,042 ARB was utilized during the 12-week LTIPP period.\n\nWe are now requesting to retain 174,958 ARB from the initial allocation to continue offsetting costs for DeFi applications that use Pyth’s on-demand price feeds. The remaining 750,000 ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO as previously agreed under the LTIPP program. Furthermore, if any funds remain unspent before the outlined timeline concludes, Pyth Data Association will promptly return those ARB tokens to the DAO.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWe have been actively seeking feedback and advice from [@Matt_StableLab](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/matt_stablelab) to determine the best approach for moving forward with this extension request.\n\nOur interest in extending the LTIPP grant was initiated in the original LTIPP discussion [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/pyth-network-ltipp-application-draft/22003/10).\n\nCurrently, we plan to submit this extension request on Snapshot by Thursday, September 5, with support from Wintermute. This timeline allows ample opportunity to gather feedback on the proposal and make any necessary adjustments based on input from the DAO.\n\nPlease note that Wintermute will merely be sponsoring the proposal as a delegate which is separate from their role as an LTIPP Council member.",

        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces the STIP Bridge, aiming to sustain and enhance Arbitrum's market leadership by extending support to key protocols amidst intense competition from other Layer 2 solutions. \n\nIt serves as a strategic interim solution, maintaining incentive alignment and ensuring continuous engagement of vital projects within the Arbitrum ecosystem until the Perpetual Incentives Program is initiated.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem is currently facing unprecedented competitive pressures, with significant incentive programs launched by rival Layer 2 networks threatening to attract our established protocols away. \n\nThe STIP Bridge is crucial for retaining these integral projects, ensuring they remain committed to Arbitrum by providing timely, targeted incentives. This initiative is essential to preserve network growth, user engagement, and overall ecosystem stability in a highly dynamic market environment.\n\n## Rationale\n\nAligning with Arbitrum's mission to support and nurture its development community, the STIP Bridge embodies our commitment to our builders and their contributions. It strategically addresses the imminent risk of losing key ecosystem participants to competitors by offering a seamless transition in incentive support. This approach not only retains critical projects and liquidity within Arbitrum but also sets a solid foundation for the impending comprehensive Perpetual Incentives Program, reinforcing our long-term vision of innovation and community empowerment.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Eligibility\n\n* Any protocol funded under STIP is eligible to apply for a bridge grant coinciding with the LTIPP distribution window.\n* This will allow Arbitrum to ensure protocols that had success during the STIP campaign can retain their users and continue to focus on building on Arbitrum.\n\n## Maximum Funding Size:\n\nMaximum funding requests under this bridge grant are capped based on a percentage of the prior funding received under STIP:\n\n* Greater than 500k ARB: may make a funding request of up to 50% of their prior funding.\n* Less than or equal to 500k ARB: may make funding requests up to 100% of their prior funding, capped at 250k ARB.\n\n## Addendum on STIP Forum post:\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project’s original STIP forum post, projects will be included in a list of all extension applicants. Specifically, a project should add the tag “STIP Bridge” to the end of their forum post. The addendum is intended to be relatively lightweight, not requiring a full STIP type proposal but should still include:\n\n* Requested amount (protocols have the option to size down their asks if they deem it more appropriate, including to help secure the support of delegates).\n* Data on the performance of their activities during STIP.\n* If the intended use of incentives is different than STIP, then details of the updated usage.\n* Links to bi-weekly STIP performance reports and Openblocks Dashboard.\n\n## Voting and Approval Mechanism:\n\n### Optimistic Approach\n\nAn optimistic voting mechanism will be used to mitigate the potential for delegate fatigue from voting on 50+ proposals while still holding projects accountable for their overall performance within STIP and in general.\n\nThis optimistic model hopes to reduce the load on all delegates but ensure that the DAO's full attention is placed on the more contentious proposals.\n\n### Voting Mechanism\n\nThe current snapshot and the immediately subsequent Tally vote will earmark funds to allow the DAO to distribute up to the maximum permissible grants.\n\nAfter applying with an addendum on the respective project's original STIP forum post, all properly submitted projects will be included in a list of extension applicants for consideration to be funded.\n\nDuring the challenge review period, any delegate with at least 500K ARB delegated can put up a forum post and an associated snapshot proposal that will result in a full DAO vote for the individual grant streams for it to be approved.  \n\nDelegates may seek a full DAO vote at their own discretion if they believe that a project did (a) not fulfill their STIP requirements, (b) failed to deliver tangible results during the STIP period or (c) the amount sought in the bridge application would not result in an effective utilization of the DAO’s funds.\n\nThis will allow the DAO delegates to focus their available attention to more closely examine contested applications. To be accepted into the bridge program alongside the unchallenged proposals, the proposal to fund must receive a supermajority (66%) of votes in favor.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\n* Send funds to STIP multisig\n* Create an addendum template for applicants\n* Have applicants post addendums\n* Conduct DAO challenge vote on Snapshot\n* Conduct individual Snapshot votes for any challenged application\n* Have successful applicants complete compliance\n* Start streams at the same time as LTIPP protocols\n* Monitored incentives throughout the program as done in STIP\n\n# Timeline\n\nThis is a rough timeline. We aim to start the STIP Bridge at the same time as LTIPP.\n\n* Week 1 (March 11 - 17)\n  * Posted to Governance Forum\n  * If requested, Community Call including discussion of Voting Mechanism\n* Week 2 (March 22 - 29)\n  * Snapshot Vote for the creation of Bridge Program\n* Week 3\n  * Tally Vote for establishing funding to LTIPP or community multisig (17 days)\n  * Start of 2-week window for protocols to submit addendums, protocols are encouraged but not obligated to submit early to allow delegates time to review\n* Week 4\n  * Continue addendum submissions\n* Week 5\n  * One week Optimistic Approval / Challenge Vote Period\n* Week 6\n  * Tally vote ends (17 days)\n  * Review and discussion period of remaining protocols not cleared in Optimistic / Challenge voting\n  * Vote on remaining contested applicants\n* Week 6\n  * STIP.b & LTIPP incentives start at the same time\n\n# Overall Cost\n\n\n## Incentives Budget: \n37,025,522 ARB\nSee estimated amounts [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ic15cTQNoa6xyIJcp-X8OC175MaCLMPrXtMW5eT87sI/edit#gid=1867228162)\n\nThe incentives budget above is the maximum allocation earmarked, any extra funds not used due to ineligible asks, projects not applying, or other reasons returned to the multisig. \n\n### Overhead: 0M ARB\n\n\n* Assumed to be the same data provider and multisig as STIP without added cost.\n* Analytics: This proposal should result in no material increase in work for the analytics vendor, given that the same team already covers STIP protocols, was mandated for making dashboards for the same, and is mandated for the entire time of LTIPP. Additionally, the multisig signing can be done at the same time as other disbursements or will use oSnap reducing the need for multi-sig signing.\n* If there is an objection, a volunteer multisig from the DAO will be assembled and community grants can be allocated by the LTIPP special grants for taking over the existing dashboards from STIP, as they are open source and IP rights if any already resides with the DAO.\n\n## Proposers:\nIncludes some proposers and developers of both STIP round 1, Backfund, LTIP and an LTIP Council member. \nAlex Lumley of SavvyDao, Dan Peng of Vela Exchange, CoinflipCanada of GMX",

        "body": "### Abstract\n\nWe would like to introduce a temporary extension of the current Delegate Incentive System for up to two months.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSEEDGov is working on the v1.1 of the Delegate Incentive System. This new version will try to implement significant changes that we believe are going to improve the actual version of the system.\n\nConsidering that the actual program concludes on August 31, that the following iteration will probably need more than one week of discussion, and that we adapt to the recent approved [DAO Calendar](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x249a8e8aef5dc59da18b72e7d14ace5197ec6242675ab7f82b3d3f17f71bb13b), we are presenting a temporary extension of the program with the objective of not interrupting delegates incentives while v1.1 is being discussed.\n\n### Rationale\n\nApproved Delegate Incentive System has proved to be cost-efficient. To date, 1,1 million ARBs are still in the DIS multisig out of a total of 1.58M initially transferred.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifai7old2hjql4pdjats5fgpy5zhqi6lvoipbd6twrekvg647pmqu)\n    \nNote I: *Special thanks to our frens [@r3gen_Finance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/r3gen_finance/summary) for an early delivery of their Arbitrum Token Flow Report. The Full Flow Report will be published soon.*\n\nNote II: *Data as of July 31, 2024*.\n\nWith the objective of maintaining the delegates engaged and incentivized while v1.1 of the system is discussed, we propose to extend the current one for a period up to two months.\n\nThis proposal will be attached to the new Delegate Incentive System. If the new version of the system is approved before the temporary extension ends, this version will be deprecated to make way for v1.1 of the System.\n\n### Costs:\n\nAs an important clarification, cost structures won’t be changed during this temporary extension. Funds will come from the [Delegate Incentive System Multisig](https://www.arbwallets.xyz/).\n\n- Monthly Delegates Incentives: TBD (Average Monthly ARB incentives: 108,7k)\n- Karma Administration Costs: 3750 ARB per month.\n- SEEDGov Administration Costs: 3.333 ARB per month.\n- Multisig Administration Costs: 5.000 ARB per month.\n\nNote: *We know that costs are out of date. In order to smooth the process we’ll keep the same operational costs until the release of Delegate Incentive System v1.1*",
