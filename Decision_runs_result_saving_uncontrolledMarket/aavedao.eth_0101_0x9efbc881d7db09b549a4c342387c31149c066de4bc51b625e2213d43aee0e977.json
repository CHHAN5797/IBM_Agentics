By implementing this change, we seek to enhance capital efficiency for borrowers using LBTC/WBTC as collateral.\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-enable-lbtc-wbtc-liquid-e-mode-on-aave-v3-core-instance/19968/7) and [TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.box/#/s:aave.eth/proposal/0x8fdee3ec7a301f9fba2e4c048227257070645d636b09a7afb369ee9c002ad764) have passed recently.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal stems from several key factors:\n\n- High Utilization: LBTC/WBTC has demonstrated significant usage as collateral for borrowing stablecoins on other platforms.\n- Capital Efficiency: Enabling liquid E-Mode for LBTC/WBTC will allow borrowers to substantially improve their capital efficiency when using this asset as collateral.\n- Controlled Growth: Liquid E-Mode provides a mechanism for more precise control over the growth and borrow demand in relation to the overall stablecoin liquidity within Aave v3 on Core Instance.\n\nBy implementing this proposal, we aim to optimize the use of LBTC/WBTC within the Aave ecosystem, attracting more liquidity for the protocol and increasing revenues.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal will add LBTC/WBTC liquid E-Mode. Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers and ARFC has been updated accordingly.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Network | Ethereum |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 800 |\n| Borrow Cap | 80 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 70.00% |\n| LT | 75.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 8.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4.0% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% |\n| Reserve Factor | 50% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n\n**E-mode**\n| Parameter | Value | Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | LBTC | WBTC |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 84% | - |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 86% | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 3.00% | - |\n\n## Useful links\n\n[**BGD.

        "body": "> Proposal edited to include Risk Providers feedback\n\n## [ARFC] Aave v3 Gnosis Instance Updates\n\n## Author: [@ACI](https://governance.aave.com/u/aci)\n\n## Date: 2024-12-20\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes several updates to the Aave v3 Gnosis instance to improve capital efficiency and add new use cases on the network. The key changes include removing GNO from isolation mode, adjusting the reserve factor for EURe, onboarding osGNO, making sDAI borrowable, and creating new relevant E-modes.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGNO has demonstrated strong stability and market presence on Gnosis Chain, making isolation mode unnecessarily restrictive and hindering network growth. Removing GNO from isolation mode will facilitate further expansion of the network.\n\nThe reduction in the EURe reserve factor aligns with the asset's performance and incentivizes increased lending activity.\n\nThe introduction of osGNO adds utility for GNO holders within the protocol and enables looping strategies using osGNO as collateral to borrow GNO. Leveraged staking use cases have been a key growth driver for Aave DAO, and enabling this on Gnosis Chain is expected to gain similar traction.\n\nMaking sDAI borrowable and introducing new E-modes will enhance capital efficiency and foster synergies between stable assets. The unique combination of EUR and USD borrowing opportunities is a distinct advantage for Gnosis Chain.\n\nsDAI, as an asset with intrinsic yield, primarily serves as collateral. It is unsuitable to apply an interest rate curve for sDAI similar to other stablecoins on Aave.\n\nTherefore, we propose a \"flat\" interest rate curve with a base rate of 1%, a slope1 of 1.5%, and a slope2 of 30%. The optimal utilization ratio should be set at 90%, with a reserve factor (RF) of 80%.\n\nThese parameters will not significantly contribute to sDAI's yield. However, as sDAI is inherently a yield-generating collateral, its primary use case is to serve as collateral for borrowing other assets.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal includes the following changes:\n\n## Specification\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Asset|osGNO|\n|Isolation Mode|N/A|\n|Borrowable|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|4,750|\n|Borrow Cap|-|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|0.05%|\n|LT|0.10%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.5%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|\n|Variable Base|-|\n|Variable Slope1|-|\n|Variable Slope2|-|\n|Uoptimal|-|\n|Reserve Factor|-|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n\n|**Parameter**|Value|**Value**|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Asset|osGNO|GNO|\n|Collateral|Yes|No|\n|Borrowable|No|Yes|\n|Max LTV|90%|-|\n|Liquidation Threshold|92.5%|-|\n|Liquidation Bonus|2.50%|-|\n\n- Remove GNO from Isolation mode\n\n**Lower Reserve Factor for EURe**\n\n|Asset|Chain|Current Reserve Factor|Rec. Reserve Factor|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|EURe|Gnosis|20%|10%|\n\n# Make sDAI Borrowable\n\nOnboard osGNO and create osGNO/GNO E-mode\n\n- List osGNO as a new non-borrowable asset \n- Create dedicated E-mode category for GNO-correlated assets\n- Proposed E-mode LTV: 90%\n- Proposed E-mode Liquidation Threshold: 92.5%\n- Proposed E-mode Liquidation Penalty: 2.5%\n\nCreate sDAI/EURe E-mode\n\n|**Parameter**|Value|**Value**|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Asset|sDAI|EURe|\n|Collateral|Yes|No|\n|Borrowable|No|Yes|\n|Max LTV|85%|85%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|87.5%|87.5%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n\n## Implementation\n\nThese changes will be implemented through a payload executing the following actions:\n\n- Configuration updates for GNO isolation mode\n- Reserve factor adjustment for EURe\n- Asset listing for osGNO\n- E-mode configuration for both new categories\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish the necessary AIPs for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-11-25\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Services Providers and ARFC has been updated with that feedback 2024-12-03\n\n# Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard Ignition's FBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol Main Market on Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nFBTC is a cross-chain BTC protocol that uses the Threshold Signature Scheme network to enable secure, decentralized Bitcoin scalability across multiple blockchains. By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks.\n\nAave is positioned to benefit from a material increase in AUM resulting from FBTC deposits. This capital is being sourced by from within the Ignition team's network. Several sophisticated investors are looking to user Aave at size and some teams have built products specifical for investors in anticipationg of the Aave listing. The Ignition team is expected to provide incentives supporting Aave users directly and also strategy providers built on top of Aave. @TokenLogic has been coordinating with various prospective users to ensure there is adequate demand ahead of the listing.\n\n### Benefits of listing FBTC\n\nWith the evolving landscape surrounding wBTC, having alternative wrapped BTC tokens available for use on Aave is crucial. With Antalpha and Mantle serving as core contributors, Ignition strong reputations position this initiative as a credible alternative to wBTC. This collaborative effort has already garnered over $850 million in TVL.\n\nThe cbBTC listing has demonstrated how impactful an Aave integration can be for both parties involved. Aave successfully captured 74% of the cbBTC supply, showcasing the significant growth potential and mutual benefits such integrations can bring.\n\n### Liquidity commitments\n\nFBTC current points campaign is focused on maximizing user engagement and incentivizing interactions within the DeFi ecosystem. As part of this initiative, they aim to highlight Aave by listing it in the featured section, providing prominent exposure to its offerings. Additionally, they plan to create a new DeFi lending category, with Aave being the inaugural protocol, further showcasing its significance in this space.\n\nTo enhance user participation, they will introduce boosted points under the Sparks program, with Aave receiving 2x-4x sparks by default; double the rewards compared to other protocols, which offer 1x-2x.\n\nFor a limited period, it will further amplify rewards by offering a 4x-8x sparks boost on Aave V3 instance, driving even greater engagement and usage.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: `0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364`\n\nChainlink oracle: `0xe5346a4Fd329768A99455d969724768a00CA63FB`\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: https://docs.fbtc.com/security/bitcoin-reserve-address\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: https://fbtc.com/proof-of-assets\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: https://github.com/fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract/tree/main/audits\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IgnitionFBTC\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Network | Ethereum |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 200 |\n| Borrow Cap | 100 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 73.00% |\n| LT | 78.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4.0% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% |\n| Reserve Factor | 50% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Services Providers and ARFC has been updated with that feedback 2024-12-03\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.
