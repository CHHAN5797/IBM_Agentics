        "body": "&nbsp;\n\n## Simple summary\n\nProposal for the activation of Aave v3.1 as an upgrade on top of all active Aave v3 instances.\n\nThe codebase can be found on https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave v3 is a “living” DeFi protocol, which akin to any other software, receives upgrades over time on its different components. Sometimes, the improvements can be made in isolation in independent upgrades, for example, almost 1 year ago, we introduced a new 3.0.2 version 1, including only relatively minor changes and bug fixes.\n\nHowever, since 3.0.2, we had multiple other ideas on the backlog heavily focused on security and optimisation, that over time got validated due to security incidents on similar protocols and by observing operational overhead for Aave contributors (e.g. governance proposals changing parameters). As some of this features in some cases were dependent between each other, end of 2023 we decided to batch them together in a new major-minor Aave v3 version we propose for activation here: **Aave v3.1**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Specification\n\n### 3.1 scope\n\nv3.1 is clearly focused in 2 fields: redundant security and optimisation of the logic to reduce operational overhead.\nWith those principles in mind, the following is a summarised of the features/improvements included in the release (for extensive information, full specification can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-1-and-aave-origin/17305#features-4)):\n\n1. Virtual accounting\n2. Stateful interest rate strategy\n3. Freezing by EMERGENCY_GUARDIAN on PoolConfigurator\n4. Reserve data update on rate strategy and RF (Reserve Factor) changes\n5. Minimum decimals for listed assets\n6. Liquidations grace sentinel\n7. LTV0 on freezing\n8. Permission-less movement of stable positions to variable\n9. Allow setting debt ceiling whenever LT is 0\n10. New getters on Pool and PoolConfigurator for library addresses\n11. Misc minor bug fixes and sync the codebase with the current v3 production\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Security\n\nThis 3.1 has undergone 3 different procedures, and optionally more are expected pre and post release:\n\n- Security review by [MixBytes](https://mixbytes.io/).\n- Security review by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), in addition to improved Certora properties since the v3 release.\n- Security review of the most critical feature (Virtual Accounting) by [StErMi](https://twitter.com/stermi).\n\nAll the reports will be added to the Aave v3.1. repository once finished.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe previous third-party procedures complement all the internal by BGD, that we apply to every codebase:\n\n- Testing of all the new features, and verifying/adapting that only intended consequences appear on previous Aave v3 features.\n- Gas implications.\n- Carefully verifying codebase and storage diffs to avoid any type of broken behaviour.\n- High-level operational implications, for example on procedures followed by other Aave contributors when doing governance proposals.\n\nAdditionally, the current Aave Immunefi bug bounty will be applicable to v3.1, once approved via governance and activated on production instances.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Upgrade procedure\n\nThe upgrade of v3 instances to v3.1 will be done same as any other Aave on-chain governance proposal: on each applicable network, an executable payload will do the appropriate implementations' upgrades together with any other intended setup.\n\nThe goal is to apply v3.1 on all active Aave v3 networks: Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Avalanche C-Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Metis, Scroll, Gnosis and BNBChain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Licensing\nAave v3.1 follows the same licensing approach as all other major contributions of BGD Labs as service provider of the Aave DAO: BUSL 1.1 licensed to the Aave governance smart contracts, explicitly forbidden the usage of the improved codebase in production by any entity competing with Aave.\n\nThe Aave DAO has full power to change this license however deemed appropriate in the future.\n\nThe full license can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Next steps\n- Pre-approval via this ARFC Snapshot for the upgrade of all Aave v3 instances to Aave v3.1.\n- In parallel, finish the preparations of the AIP payload for the upgrade, and any extra security procedure around it.",

        "body": "# Summary\nPresent to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development services, after Phase 1 and 2.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 1. Motivation. Aave and BGD 1, 2….3\n\nMay 9th 2022, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 1, a proposal for services to the DAO, covering a pretty extensive scope on the big majority of Aave sub-systems; development and security related.\n\nDuring the following 15 months, we [did or participated in dozens of projects](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-working-day-365/13033)  of technical nature for the Aave DAO, and more importantly, we set precedent that a model of a fully independent company providing services to a decentralised entity can work.\n\nSeptember 4th 2023, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 2, with similar type of scope as Phase 1, but with slightly different objectives in mind: the technical foundation of the Aave DAO was pretty solid from Phase 1, and possible to iterate on top of it, with a more concrete scope.\nAdditionally, we set ourselves as a goal to study how to introduce extra technical parties to service specific needs of the DAO, helping more on the decentralisation of the organisation, but without disturbing operations and delivery.\n\nAlso, we proposed a way shorter engagement (6 months), which we thought was more optimal for the DAO to have capacity to manoeuvre. The outcome of this work can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bored-ghosts-phase-2-recap/16791).\n\n\n\nWe think that our services to the DAO on both Phases had played a role on Aave staying in top of its category for years in so nascent field, and the Aave codebase being used in other products, accounting to close to 75% of total market share category.\n\nNow we present Phase 3, continuist, but with some important changes in terms of scope.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 2. Specification. Aave <> BGD Phase III. The scope\n\nThis time, we want to explicit divide our proposal in 2 different and explicit components, each one with its separate scope, budget and duration characteristics.\n\n## Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO\n\nThis scope is the continuist component historically performed by BGD for the DAO, and will be composed of the following items:\n\n- Maintain, improve and consolidate all the Aave tooling introduced in Phases I & II, including but not limited to Aave Address Book, Aave Helpers, Aave Proposals, Risk Stewards, Seatbelt and Killswitch.\n- Maintain and improve Aave Governance v3, a.DI and Aave Robot, together with the tooling surrounding them.\n    \n    The following new items will be delivered, consequence of the research done on Phase 2:\n    \n    - Extend coverage of voting networks to rollups, apart from the current Polygon PoS and Avalanche C-Chain.\n    - Allow voting with AAVE tokens held in non-Ethereum networks.\n    - Granular and generalised consensus rules for a.DI, together with different planned optimisations.\n- Propose further improvements on top of the upcoming Aave 3.1.\n- Different v3 maintenance tasks with important development requirements, including:\n    - Improve asset off-boarding procedures.\n    - Complete removal of stable debt logic.\n- Act as reviewers of Aave <> Immunefi for all current Aave ecosystem, not including GHO (Avara currently being the reviewer). Additionally, doing proper maintenance of the bug bounty program.\n- Act as security coordinator of the Aave ecosystem, including:\n    - Continuously evaluate potential technical risks for Aave.\n    - Design specific protection strategies in the event of any vulnerability affecting Aave.\n    - If arising, create governance proposals to mitigate any type of problem affecting Aave.\n    - Coordinate with the Aave Guardian for protective emergency actions.\n- Support with further technical off-boarding strategies for legacy versions of Aave (v1, v2) in a safe manner, both for the DAO and the users of the protocol.\n- Advise other contributors on which security procedures to apply for their developments, when required.\n- Evaluate new upcoming high-level technical implications/risks for the protocol, for example, new types of assets being listed.\n- Generally advise other contributors, whenever feedback from an entity expert on the Aave protocol is required. This includes but is not limited to contributors on the risk, treasury, security reviews and miscellaneous fields.\n- Review governance proposals on pre-onchain stage, not as a full security audit, but in order to verify that we don’t see any integration problem with Aave’s smart contracts and good practises.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO*\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phase 2, 6 months, starting from proposal execution.\n\n**BUDGET**: as some items are not included in the scope (more later), the budget has been reduced from Phase 2. 1’600’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 60% paid up-front and 40% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n\n## What is NOT part of the scope\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor.\nGiven our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so.\nAny tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Scope 2: Aave Safety Module - Code A\n\nAs commented before, we believe now the Aave DAO is in a really solid stage of their current systems, quite future-proof and ready to scale:\n\n- Aave v3 is a solid liquidity layer, on which is possible to iterate and improve.\n- Aave Governance v3 is probably the most advanced on-chain governance system in production.\n- a.DI is a totally generic bridging layer, that can be used for any cross-chain communication need on the Aave ecosystem, in a secure and scalable manner.\n- Aave Robot is a solid automation layer, integrated with Chainlink Automation, but flexible enough for any technology.\n\nMore in the line of innovative projects like Aave Governance v3, we propose to create a completely new system in an Aave component which requires improvement: the Aave Safety Module.\n\n\n### Aave Safety Module: Code A\n\nSafety Module Code A is the major project on the innovation side of this scope, but different to previous cases, our proposed approach is different: at the moment, we will not disclose a detailed description of it, as we think this is the right strategic approach for the DAO.\n\nHowever, we can say the following about Code A:\n\n- It will change completely the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE and stkABPT.\n- More efficient mechanism than the current.\n- Improved use experience.\n- Heavily improved dynamics for builders to build on top, but still batteries included.\n- Affecting importantly AAVE tokenomics.\n- Holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO.\n- Directly/indirectly benefiting any future project of the DAO.\n\nWe are aware this requires some trust by the community on our research and execution capabilities (which is reflected on the payment schedule), but considering that the main beneficiary will be explicitly the DAO and our history of services, we think it is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 2. Safety Module Code A*\n\n**DURATION**: this scope is not continuous like Scope 1, but our estimation is similar for full completion, approximately during the next 6 months to have everything fully ready and in production.\nHowever, delivery and communications will definitely be iterative, with extensive details of Project A to be disclosed in the first 2 months, and highly probably some of its components.\n\n**BUDGET**: 1’900’000 in stablecoins and 7’500 AAVE, with the following schedule:\n\n- 40% upfront.\n- 60% in a delayed payment in 4-months from now, when we estimate to be in good stage of completion.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Terms of Service\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the major software we have produced during our engagement have been licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication: \n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if other models can be explorer, from our point of view, this is a pretty solid contribution model for the innovation side of the DAO.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Next steps\n\nIf this ARFC Snapshot is positive, we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal that will serve as formal and binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs, on the terms defined.",

Those same LP positions can be deposited into other protocols to earn yield without the prospect of being slashed. These alternative investment options create an opportunity cost and act as a minimum APY hurdle rate when considering investing in Aave’s SM.\n\nThis publication presents an opportunity to enable participants in the Aave SM to earn rewards from other protocols whilst providing a backstop to Aave. The inclusion of GHO pools further helps provide sustained liquidity in the market and generate revenue for Aave through GHO’s borrow rate.\n\nThis introduces the prospect of increasing the sustainability of the SM by enabling rewards to scale with TVL over time which is currently solely dependent upon AAVE’s price correlation with the SM’s TVL given the fixed distribution limitation.\n\nThis proposal will discuss the differences between “classic” gauges and specific ones (“smBPT gauges”) as outlined in the [intro post](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029/6?u=dydymoon), and will introduce the strategy.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for ‘Balancer Pool Token’) for a time duration up to 1 year. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nBalancer token emission is currently at 121,930 BAL/week and decreases linearly each year.\n\nveBAL holders can vote each week to redirect part of these incentives to the pool of their choice.\n\nAt the time of writing, 1 veBAL can redirect 0.01187 BAL /veBAL vote/week ($0.0851).\n\nBy using the voting power & voting incentives, it is possible to either leverage better rewards for the similar $$ cost or similar APR rewards with reduced cost. Our calculations are based on delivering a similar APR to users whilst reducing the overall dollar spend on the SM.\n\nLike Curve, the APR of liquidity pools staked on Balancer (BPT-XX-gauge) can be boosted up 2.5x depending on several parameters, such as veBAL boost holdings, value deposited, total TVL of the pool etc. However, having the max boost requires a huge amount of veBAL, which most projects don’t have.\n\nWhile they can still buy boosts on Marketplace like Warden, it can be expensive and potentially limitate the strategy profitability. However, there are projects accumulating a considerable amount of veTokens to mutualize the boost, improving the yield for depositors.\n\nAura Finance is the biggest on the Balancer ecosystem with [27% of the veBAL held by the protocol](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/balancer). These holdings are utilized to boost the users deposits (Most of the pools are currently boosted ~1.4x).\n\nIt’s important to note that 25% of all BAL earned on Aura are captured by the protocol, which distributes AURA rewards in return, the Aura Finance governance token. More details on the AURA distribution can be found [here](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/distribution).\n\nThe AURA token can be locked for 4 months for vlAURA without decay on the voting power, which allows to participate on Aura Governance, Balancer gauges votes as it controls the underlying veBAL voting power, and can receive rewards in auraBAL & vote incentives. At this time, 1 vlAURA controls 0.2081 veBAL. Once a gauge is voted on Balancer, the pool is added on Aura Finance in the following days.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to consider staking the LPs deposited in the SM on Aura Finance, to receive BAL + AURA rewards distributed to SM depositors. However, there are different possibilities to reach this goal:\n\n## “Classic” gauges mechanism\n\nAfter a liquidity pool is created, an application is shared on the respective communities governance forum to create a gauge. Upon creation, users are able to deposit their LPs into the gauges to earn rewards.\n\nProjects like Aura Finance receive the BPTs, deposit them into the Balancer gauge and retain a portion of the BAL emission in exchange of their own governance token. Users receive an elevated yield to reward users for the additional smart contract risk and premium for replacing BAL with AURA. Aave could deploy contracts within the SM that extends this concept and enable users to receive Aura Finance and Balancer rewards.\n\nMost projects are proposing to enable the gauge on the BPT assets. This works quite well because they are creating vote incentives (often with their native token) to acquire votes in veBAL & wrappers, directing more rewards to the pool, making it attractive for the community to deposit liquidity.\n\nHowever, if Aave’s SM was to accept the BPT directly and not deposit the BPT into the Balancer Gauge. Any users could deposit & stake their BPT to receive BPT-gauge without depositing in the SM, allowing them to bypass the SM lock period and cooldown to receive the same incentives as SM depositors, so classic gauges invalidates the strategy\n\nThis would create a huge dilution for Aave, which is a large issue when the liquidity also doubles as protocol insurance. If Aave was to offer the same APR as Aura Finance there is no incentive for users to take on the additional shortfall and cool down period lock up risk/opportunity cost.\n\nIn Part IV, the SM upgrade proposal will consider using 75% of the current incentives budget for volatile & stable BPTs categories. That’s 825 AAVE/ day that could either be used to incentivize the pools directly (Not recommended to keep doing liquidity mining for all categories) or to create vote incentives for the associated gauges driving a higher rewards value to the pools.\n\nThis method can still be used for main liquidity pools outside of the SM, but to keep the proposed strategy profitable for Aave, an alternative could be what this publication will refer to as “smBPT gauges” which is a suggestion from Solarcurve.\n\n## “smBPT gauges mechanism”\n\nThe method requires implementing a wrapper in the safety module. The SM contract receives BPT from users, and deposits in the wrapper contract which would mint smBPT received by the SM.\n\nInstead of enabling gauges that accept the BPT, Balancer can approve BAL emissions to gauges which accept the smBPT. Users would have the option to deposit the BPT into Aave’s SM to mint smBPT which will be deposited on Aura Finance which then deposits the smBPT into the Balancer gauge.\n\nThis means that any users could deposit liquidity and receive the trading fees on the underlying Balancer pools, but only users who stake their BPT in the SM would be eligible to gauge rewards.\n\nIf the smBPT gauges are approved by the Balancer DAO, Aura Finance will implement the pools associated with these gauges. The gauges will only accept smBPT. This eliminates the opportunity cost as users can not deposit into Aura Finance or Balancer’s gauge directly and avoid the slashing plus cool down risk. Considering that the SM would mint the smBPT internally, it would be the only contract available to stake on this gauge.\n\nOnce deposited, the SM contract would receive “aurasmBPT-gauge” and mint “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” distributed to the initial BPT depositors.\n\nIf a user wants to withdraw from the SM, he would activate the cooldown period. The SM contract would then burn the “aurasmBPT-gauge” by unstaking from Aura Finance to receive smBPT. It would then unlock and distribute the BPT as well as burn the smBPT and “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” once the withdrawal is done.\n\nAt this point, and while several aspects of the proposals have been updated since the strategy introduction post, this chart should help understand and visualize the overall strategy described.\n\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreih2bqouhr75txq5jog2gi4xdstlorn7wb3qdhjkzhlmhem6ojn7ey)\n    \nConsidering that the veBAL voting power held by Aave is not enough to sustain these pools with good TVL, the goal is to use part of the SM rewards budget as votes incentives.\n\nThe part IV of this proposal will focus on incentives management updates and details on estimations made, while the part V will be mostly about further considerations.\n\n## smBPT Risks\n\nTo implement interoperability and integrate different protocols, several changes are needed, which will result in the upgraded SM contracts having greater smart contract risk than in the current implementation. Introducing smBPT to the SM creates additional Balancer gauge and Aura smart contract risk exposure.\n\nThe current ABPT integration demonstrates the community's willingness to have exposure to the Balancer protocol within the SM. Aave further demonstrated confidence in the Balancer <> Aave partnership via the token swap performed during 2022. Since then, Balancer has launched several liquidity pools which deposit funds in Aave v3 across several networks. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAave and Balancer have been working together since the launch of the Safety Module. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAura Finance is a protocol built on top of the[ Balancer system](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) to provide maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and BAL stakers (into[ veBAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512)) through social aggregation of BAL deposits and Aura’s native token. Even if the protocol is relatively young (launched on June 3, 2022), the team has an extensive focus on security, having run 3 [audits](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits): [Peckshield](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5jnMddjbVUsAdVZtmcIRlL4WhVueSzp/view), [Halborn,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsZ9aAVJ8mobLaJ5-XDejcHdRFK1StjM/view) [Code4rena](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts/blob/main/audits/Code4rena-Audit-Report-AuraFinance-v1.0.pdf)\n\nAura started a $1 million [bug bounty program on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/aurafinance/) on June 16, 2022 and to date, no vulnerabilities have been found.\n\nMoreover, Aura was given a rating of [88% from DeFiSafety](https://defisafety.com/app/pqrs/526) which also suggested improvements to protocol documentation (actively being worked on now by contributors).\n\nFinally, some security researchers and developers are closely looped into Aura via its multisig, and general protocol oversight.\n\n## Smart Contract Considerations\n\nAave Governance as admin, can perform the following:\n\n* Add/remove assets into the SM\n* Invoke Emergency power to withdraw of all funds deployed by the SM on Aura\n* Update reward budget influencing the SM yield\n* Update the slashing parameters & associated yield ranges\n\nAave SM as admin, can perform the following:\n\n* Receive BPT and mint smBPT\n* Deposit/withdraw smBPT from Aura\n* Mint/Burn smBPT and aurasmBPT-XX-gauge\n* Claim BAL & AURA rewards\n* Redistribute the rewards to StkaurasmBPT-XX-gauge or StkTokens holders (This can probably done weekly/bi-weekly)\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Deploy wrapper contract to wrap BPT into smBPT (BGD)\n* Enable gauges on smBPT voted in Part I & II. (Llama)\n* Enable SM Staking on Aura for Volatile & Stables LP categories (Llama)\n* Add rewards management & redistribution mechanism (BGD)\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Implement smBPT gauges & Aura Staking\nNAE - Implement classic BPT gauges\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

However, in some cases, for lack of monitoring of the positions, and in others, because it is not profitable, multiple users have stayed in stable rate mode, not swapping to variable.\n\nThe proposal consists in an update to the Aave Pool and its affected libraries to make the `swapBorrowRateMode()` permission-less (technical details apart) in order to allow any address to trigger a swap of rate from variable to stable.\n\nThis will allow, for example, an Aave DAO automation to swap all current stable debt positions to variable, without any type of penalty to the users, apart from losing their stable exposure (sometimes positive for them, sometimes negative, if compared with the current variable rate).\n\nAs no new positions with stable rate can be created, this will allow for the final off-boarding of the mode, once all positions are at variable.",

        "body": "Author: Alchemix Core Team\nForum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-alusd-as-borrowable-to-aave-v2/7191\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave. alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity, and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow. Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD, with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD. alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools, with ~450m in liquidity. In addition to the Curve pool, alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap, Saddle, and mStable. According to Parsec Finance’s StableRank, alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1% slippage. Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions, alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE.\n\n[alUSD StableRank Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/iMyToUj)\n\n# About Alchemix and alUSD\nAlchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO. Alchemix is, at its core, an overcollateralized stablecoin, much like DAI and other similar tokens. It has some key differences however.\n\nAlchemix only mints like-kind or “mirror” al-Assets. For example, alUSD is only mintable by DAI (and later USDT and USDC), and alETH is only mintable by ETH (and later other ETH derivatives). Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn, of which the earned yield doubly repays users’ debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module. In addition, there is no interest paid in the borrowing of al-Assets. Due to this structure, Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system. This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions - taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI. In effect, the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits.\n\nAlchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms.\n1. 50% LTV for minting alUSD, which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol.\n2. DAO-managed debt caps that limit the over-minting of alUSD\n3. The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI. If alUSD is under the peg, people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount. If alUSD is over the peg, users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price, and they can self-liquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage.\n4. The Transmuter module guarantees 1:1 conversions of alUSD to DAI, the conversion process isn’t instant, but it can present good arbitrage opportunities, which helps to stabilize the peg.\n5. Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers, which attracts liquidity to the pool, further boosting the peg.\n\nalUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200%, while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100%. The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157%. The supply can expand in two ways – an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans, or debt repayments with DAI, which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD. This is how we have a supply of ~239m with a current debt cap of 150m. alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter, where it is converted 1:1 to DAI over time.\n\nThese mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the $1 peg since its inception.\n\n# Motivation\nalUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin. In addition to protocol improvements, Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal. Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto, getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD. The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi, the more resilient it will become, which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply.\n\nGoing forward, Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral, and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies. AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future. When these upgrades take place, we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE, similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn.\n\n# alUSD Benefits to Aave Users\nalUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI, USDC, USDT, mUSD, FEI, FRAX, and LUSD in our various markets. It is simple to swap between other stables. DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too. In addition, there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs. For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but don’t have stablecoins from which to mint it, borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD. The alUSD can be used for yield farming, or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins, to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market. alUSD is also used in an alETH/alUSD options market on premia.finance. Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations.\n\n# Security Considerations and Risk Analysis\nCertik Audit for the Core Contracts: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf\n\nCurrently, the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting, which is then executed by a community + developer multisig + timelock contract. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.\n\nAave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD, and assigned an overall risk rating of B+ [Risks per Asset - Risk](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risks-per-asset). USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. USDC and USDT have ratings of A- and B+ respectively. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks. Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral.\n\nThe Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token. It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. Currently, all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemist.sol contract. When we launch our version two, the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions. Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions. The core alchemist.sol contract cannot be upgraded, but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters: collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, and fee percentage. Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemix’s sentinel mode, which pauses the contract in case of an emergency.\n\n# Protocol Data\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap - 242,165,957 USD.\n- 24h Volume - typically ranges between 1-4m.\n- Markets: Curve, Saddle, Sushi, mStable, Premia\n\n### Social Channels data (Size of communities, activity on github)\n- Twitter: 40.2k\n- Discord: 7.5k\n- Medium: 1.7k\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens:\n- alUSD Deployment Date: 2/27/2021\n- Transactions: 49,594\n- Token Holders: 1328\n\n# Implementation\nThe alUSD price oracle will be served via Chainlink.
