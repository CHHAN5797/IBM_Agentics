Create an Ethereum eMode.\nauthor: Llama - Defi_Consulting\ndated: 2023-01-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Optimism V3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAcross the Aave Liquidity Pools, stETH is listed on Aave v2 Ethereum and wstETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Optimism Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled.  \n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, more than $281k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Optimism users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Llama, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.55B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.83B) and ETH ($1.42B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Optimism Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Optimism. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and has already generated $281k by late January.\n \n![Screenshot 2023-01-29 at 19.09.51.png](ipfs://bafkreifbt44i7me57hhozvj664bdjcfjotmg4zi5qzjficp4k2boshqt6y)\n    \nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Optimism, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum.

However, TVL and daily revenue are gradually declining. \n\nThis proposal intends to adjust the v2 wETH interest rate curve to match the v3 wETH interest rate curve which is expected to lead to high utilization of the v2 wETH reserve and partially offset the emerging declining week on week revenue trend.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince AIP 131 was implemented, the amount of stETH deposited as collateral to borrow wETH has been fairly consistent. However, the amount of wETH borrowed by users who deposited stETH as collateral has reduced from 515.21K to 413.74K between 18th December 2022 and 15th January 2023 (pre Aave v3 launch). The tapering of borrowing demand is reflected in Aave’s wETH nominated revenue figures as shown below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YQpHY0c.png)\n\nThe market is indicating that there is insufficient demand for borrowing wETH. Three possible reasons are shown below:\n\n* Structured products charge a fee\n* Additional smart contract risk\n* Elevated exposure to DEX liquidity\n\nOur analysis indicates the Slope1, 5.75%, is most likely the primary causes of the reduced wETH demand. Lowering the Slope1 parameter will enable users to achieve a higher return from entering the recursive loop strategy. The chart below shows how users that deposit stETH and borrow wETH have behaved to date. The date highlighted below is the date AIP131 was executed.\n\n\n\nThis proposal intends to reduce the Slope1 parameters on the v2 market to 3.8% and introduce a Base of 1%. The borrowing rate at the Upotimal point is reduced from 5.75% to 4.8% (Base + Slope1). Introducing a Base, with a Lower Slope1 (4.8% < 5.75%) parameter, acts to reduce the gradient between 0% < Utilization < Uoptimal compared to having a Slope1 = Base + Lower Slope1. \n\nThe graphic below shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curves.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/72v0mJr.png)\n\nThe graphic below shows the proposed interest rate with Base, Slope1 and Slope2 parameters detailed.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BKd9DUk.png)\n\nIt is worth noting that borrowing wETH becomes slightly more expensive at lower utilization compared to the current wETH interest rate. When utilization is less than 41% borrowing costs are higher, ranging 0 to 0.98%, and when utilization is greater than 41% borrowing costs are lower, ranging 0 to 0.95%. Current utilization is 46% on the v2 deployment which means the borrowing costs would be reduced.\n\nThe chart below shows the relative change in borrowing costs for users, comparing the current versus the proposed interest rate curve.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6XyC2Hn.png)\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed wETH interest rate curve for the Ethereum v2 and v3 deployment.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|80.00|80.00|\n|Base|0.00|1.00|\n|Slope1|5.75|3.80|\n|Slope2|80.00|80.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00|15.00|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @scottincrypto\nDated: 2022-12-17 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend BAL interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3 and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere is currently a high demand for borrowing BAL (interest rate = 28.18% on Polygon v3) across all Reserves. The BAL liquidity pools offer poor capital efficiency, with the utilization of the Reserve ([48.27%](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x9a71012b13ca4d3d0cdc72a177df3ef03b0e76a3&marketName=proto_polygon_v3) on Polygon v3) often near the Optimal point of 45%.\n\nBy changing the interest rate curve across all three active Liquidity Pools, this proposal is expected to improve capital efficiency by lowering interest rates on markets where borrowing is disabled and enticing capital to move to where borrowing demand generates an attractive yield. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and generate significant capital efficiency within the BAL Reserves.\n\nDue to the ongoing incentives offered by Aura Finance, any new deposits are expected to be borrowed. Users are able to borrow and deposit BAL into [Aura Finance’s staking contract](https://app.aura.finance/) to earn a yield of around 45% at the time of writing. This creates an arbitrage opportunity of 16.82% taking into account the liquidation risk, auraBAL peg and additional Smart Contract risk.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUsers are expected to continue borrowing BAL to earn yield whilst interest rates permit and, in doing so, will create ongoing borrowing demand for BAL. Changing the interest rate curve by amending the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will improve the capital efficiency of Reserves. However, with borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it is rational for profit driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield.\n\nThe three charts below show the most recent 5 month historical BAL interest rate across each BAL Reserve. The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 28.18% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14% which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pyLdQvS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6sNc6ku.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eAG1lOG.png)\n\nIn addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at 0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a BAL interest rate similar to the SNX interest rate curve which has a base 3%, slope 1 12% and slope 2 100%.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b3kks7y.png)\n\nUtilization of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 73.33% assuming users can borrow BAL and are willing to pay an interest rate of 13%, which is less than the current borrowing rate of 28.18%. With a borrowing cost of 14% at the Optimal point, depositing BAL into Aura Finance’s auraBAL staking contract or B-80BAL-20wETH / auraBAL gauge will remain lucrative for users. If the utilization exceeds the Uoptimal point, a follow up proposal will propose increasing the interest rate further.\n\nThe improved capital efficiency of the BAL Reserve is expected to lead to an increase in BAL liquidity on-chain. The more on-chain liquidity there is, the more expensive it is to manipulate an oracle feed. Based upon the @ChaosLabs Borrow Cap formula, Llama proposes increasing the Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 from  96,798.00 units to 256,140.00 units.\n\nWith respect to the Polygon v3 deployment, assuming the BAL Reserve remains at $979,230, the revenue generated at the Optimal point for the DAO will increase from $6.17k to $20.4k, or 230%. The Reserve utilization increases from 45% to 80%, which reduces the amount of unused BAL by 63.6%. This will provide a significant increase in capital efficiency.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the BAL Interest Rate on Ethereum v2, Polygon v2 and Polygon v3.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nThe below shows the proposed changes to the Borrow Cap on Polygon v3.\n\n|Polygon Parameter| Units |\n| --- | --- | \n| Supply Cap | 284,600 (no change)|\n| Borrow Cap | 256,140 |\n\nBorrow Cap is calculated: \n(Uoptimal + 0.1) x SupplyCap\n(0.8+0.1) x 284,600 = 256,140\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0\\(https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3\n\nUSDT is currently one of the largest V2 stablecoin reserve with ~335m$ supplied\n\nMotivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Tether or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided introduce USDT as a non-collateral asset.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same as for USDT in V2. for now.\nThe ACI is supportive of onboarding USDT as it was in V2.\nFor now, the ACI doesn’t consider V3 mature enough to activate a USD stablecoins emode and consider USDT in it.\nAlso, supply and borrow caps are suggested for this asset to limit risk exposure.\nThey’re currently set to allow reserve utilization to cross the Uoptimal point slightly. But @ChaosLabs & @Pauljlei input is valuable on this.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: USDT\n\nContract Address: 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\t0.1\nBorrow Cap\t185M\nSupply Cap\t200M\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t90%\nSlope2\t72%\nAdditional note:\nUSDT has been excluded from collateral assets since DeFi inception due to its centralized nature. After years of functioning as intended and witnessing the growth of USDC in the DeFi ecosystem, it seems that reasons for exclusion have fewer grounds in the current DeFi ecosystem and pragmatic approach would be to onboard it in a conservative way and make risk parameters evolve based on market data.\nWhile this ARC doesn’t present a proposal to add USDT as collateral, the ACI thinks the community should consider this as something to discuss at a later stage when V3 will have more maturity.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This proposal intends to increase the CRV Supply Cap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves.\n\nCapital efficiency is improved by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, doubling the interest rate at the Uoptimal point, and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and significantly reduce the amount of free CRV in aggregate across the Reserves.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the CRV Reserve on Polygon reaching its Supply Cap, this is an ideal time to implement an upgrade that addresses the Supply Cap and Interest Rate parameters. The current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand.\n\nLlama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to the veTokenomics construct presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield. In this proposal, the Uoptimal parameter is to be increased from 45% to 80% improving the capital efficiency of the active reserves.\n\n![|602x313](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s7aDxseIhZFmkcsD1j8tWyQFga-HZk1mNV-uEX12phtadq4WtnSfbKMKd4wMthKXRSsmTdZbuLSta4RlxfCmU14dKTLp4Urcg1tfsfUpFLRS4VOjnGl8-1R1V01W1p2bQuE8h2ugtrkYYDaettYEounjAJLeccwbADoZKgiTIYhUJPiHDy831KtI9Bu8eA)\n\n![|602x251](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dzguCUi1-d2HtOJgrpwv_toQLT1_EWIVv6F481ydAaOHcapkzOJFFCD-UNFvB-MoHkF8hmZ4pcBvOKdah_97j0x1A_0vOl9ZqafUraTwSumo-sipYYnP03K6eqfvq7UnyBDWFrzbC4LAoOeUbQvq9EtkN_yeTnMG39l7GPjjJQ324JcW_mw4r3JB7SVARA)\n\nSpecific to the Polygon v3 deployment, increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will lead to an increase in the Borrow Cap, which is a function of the Supply Cap and Uoptimal parameter.\n\nBorrow Cap = Supply Cap * (Uoptimal + 0.1)\n\nThe new Supply Cap parameter has been prepared by Chaos Labs, 1,125.24. This generates a new Borrow Cap of 1,012.72, [2].\n\nWith borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it will become rational for profit-driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. This has been playing out with demand on Polygon v3 increasing relative to other deployments.\n\n![|602x220](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6JBjVL3HMRZ4_Bteuv2DluxmvzeGBylyijRmHcH43eLscs8ECgeDSCG6fFcYAlJxAOktJX_DQyw1ZcY5uxJQVugOBaihQFNWNydFXQFmV5QB5VdqTaNYmFobEjYyzRNGvtbzaCgHJ_POCDAgbqqX6KmwoErQYl5k-35AmQMnz9lBK4xB46HdRlEYcl8NSA)\n\n![|602x201](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QamXX3bRroYrZVEbgcF1cytYUAgrXjOXumC0-v84ZL0r0xgRRj1VkV1jBpkyyq2DOlzf3MoV_BWbe25ifn1KyldCL7Nui4Ha4sbo3O6v19ipKGdR1OOa1zWJe-2T5jQEcpYCT6eGWie2R2NcgMQ5-p9hcX0gucEw_yWdVtOaTmgHsZpapnZ5n4vpUfmnbA)\n\n![|602x201](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iedXQAPBKjRykGaxXYuvs-NvCstapd5YCB-oxREIHJMeLZydPdR_PkSBQrCAzhFRkEDignsnsnjLJcdg9PZF1obv_pfpMr5vULL9CJnPYzJbip1dGRgFAWqj8gzBBex0JaTwbB_nBS5TNgVn9dFmM951luswHEhgW6YG77Ln0DImSRoKa_ksqZR_VR-ncw)\n\nThe interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 44,48% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14%, which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.\n\nIn addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at >0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a CRV interest rate equivalent to the BAL interest rate curve (which has a base 3%, slope 1 = 14%, and slope 2 = 150%).\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n\n![|602x369](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Amrx2pG78HWfKFk3BI02p7HlHcb5BfRB6z6eZe321w8jBJiLJ7iF4LyAKU52uHaz-dwE-4CezkG3KP3CD1w30TxLHdn4B92rsFB2FKt0PXrTbauBmAyqUnshYGY0YjGR5eEMfnWZgO6Hj2OSxa-u8PP0Y35mr7DaPes4Ufz_7Bh-OpM-L_nSwQe_dlcNBw)\n\nThe Reserve Factor on Polygon v3 is to be increased from 10% to 20%, bringing it in line with all other Aave deployments.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the CRV Reserve on Polygon v2, Polygon v3, Ethereum v2 and the soon to be deployed Ethereum v3 liquidity pool.\n\nPolygon v3\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|937.70K|1,125.24K|\n|BorrowCap|640.44K|1,012.72K|\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|10|20|\n\nPolygon v2 - Frozen\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nEthereum v3 - Not yet deployed\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|NA|80|\n|Base|NA|3|\n|Slope1|NA|14|\n|Slope2|NA|150|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|20|\n\nEthereum v2 - Frozen\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x172370d5cd63279efa6d502dab29171933a610af&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v3-borrow-caps-methodology/10925\n[3] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [3].",
