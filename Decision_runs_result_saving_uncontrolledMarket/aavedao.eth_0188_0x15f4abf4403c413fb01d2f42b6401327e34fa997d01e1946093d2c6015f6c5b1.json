        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] BUIDL GSM\nAuthor: @aavelabs\nDate: 2024-09-04\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis Temp Check proposes to build and deploy GHO Stability Module (GSM) to support reserve allocation and management features enabling third party integrations, specifically supporting integration into the BlackRock BUIDL 90 infrastructure.\n\n## Motivation\nThe primary purpose of GHO Stability Module (GSM) is to ensure the stability of GHO in scenarios of increasing or decreasing demand, effectively providing 1:1 convertibility between GHO and the other asset within the specific GSM. In the case of GHO:USDC, this can result in a surplus of USDC that in current deployed implementation remains idle.\n\nAave Labs proposes to build a new instance of GSM that supports external integrations and related control mechanisms, specifically supporting BlackRock’s BUIDL. With this implementation GSM can be more capital efficient while maintaining the high standards of backing as USDC is backing the GHO.\n\nBUIDL 25 is deployed on the Ethereum network, providing onchain access to traditional financial assets managed by BlackRock Financial Management Inc., with BNY Mellon as custodian, Securitize as transfer agent, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the appointed fund auditor. BUIDL offers a novel approach to the digital asset space by combining the reliability of traditional financial mechanisms with the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology.\n\nBlackRock has partnered with Coinbase, Anchorage, Fireblocks, and Digital Bank NA as infrastructure providers, and with Circle for the onchain USDC redemption fund, ensuring instant liquidity for onchain participants.\n\nBUIDL is priced at $1 per token and pays daily accrued dividends directly to holders wallets in the form of new tokens each month. The fund allocates 100% of its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, allowing holders to earn yield while holding the token on the blockchain. BUIDL holders can transfer their tokens 24/7/365 to other pre-approved holders. Additionally, fund participants have flexible custody options, allowing them to choose how to hold their tokens.\n\nThe BUIDL fund currently has over $500 million in issuance 10, with Circle providing a $100 million USDC redemption fund that guarantees conversion from BUIDL back into USDC for use in the USDC GSM. As of now, the redemption fund has $74.7 million USDC available.\n\nThis GSM implementation sets the technical ability for the Aave DAO, essentially expanding yield sources into real-world assets (RWAs), and increasing the partnership opportunities with BlackRock. Additionally, it provides a hedge against fluctuating yield opportunities in DeFi markets.\n\n## Specification\nThe proposed GSM instance that will run in parallel with already existing GSMs, will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO, utilizing the USDC surplus to mint BUIDL tokens. Thanks to instant redeemability between USDC and BUIDL, the GSM can mint and burn BUIDL in exchange for USDC based on user demand, ensuring a seamless experience similar to the existing GHO:USDC GSM. Swap fees will be accumulated in GHO, and dividends will be paid monthly in BUIDL.\n\nArchitecture may or may not integrate a USDC buffer to compensate the gas redemption cost of BUIDL for small swaps, subject to further evaluation.\n\nThe GSM contract code requires modifications to support GHO <> USDC conversions and dividend reception. Additionally, BUIDL holders must be registered/allowlisted, meaning the GSM itself must also be registered.\n\nA detailed specification will be shared during the ARFC phase.\n\n## Next Steps\nIf Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:\n\n* Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n* Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n* Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)\n\nWe propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.\n\nIf the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: PYUSD\nContract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8\n](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)Price Feed: [0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1)\n\nChainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)\n\nWe propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap (PYUSD)|10M|\n|Borrow Cap (PYUSD)|9M|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|N/A|\n|LT|N/A|\n|Liquidation Bonus|N/A|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|80.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|8.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n|Flashloanable|No|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n\n## Liquidity and Market Cap\n\nThe PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.\n\n![|624x488](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/X-CIRWD8o7MXopvExHIFu0nv9useOuTbrMej_SoD_zJskFtFpkHtvBVietrrSEjtVsfHdoUtOlSxfRCdH2HzoIJg-VpGcZhsfebkk17eDhBoS3RKPijCFDP2D_XbMKeJ1C-jP8XeTWtOwJpPEhLC3Fk)\n\nWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.\n\n![|604x476](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WzRKS4ZDZop1OhjeZG-qnhCYb3x3zT5bT8gE6AlJAJZBjcqmWMR7HcKXnrngqWlUV3MYeZI-W3xcMHRzFx6RA-BCDF3_SrKJR4ahLDB2jVp6Rm0-12PbBSrrgD6l-D23uhk8Kogpr2lVYEIiMCYtn7U)\n\nWith peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.\n\n### Initial Supply and Borrow Caps\n\nPYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.\n\n### Variable Borrow Rate\n\nWe recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.\n\n### Borrowable in Isolation\n\nWe do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Paxos or Trident and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. . If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] AAVE Treasury Proposal for RWA Allocation with Maple Finance \n\nAuthor: @Maple_Direct\n\nCreated: 2023-11-20\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nMaple Finance would like to propose that Aave’s Treasury allocates stablecoins into Maple Finance’s cash management pool to earn the risk-free rate on-chain, further diversifying their existing and future RWA holdings.\n\nThe main results of this proposal will be:\n\n1. Aave will onboard with Maple Finance to enable the treasury to allocate to RWA strategies on the platform.\n2. Aave Treasury to allocate to Maple’s Cash Management pool, with an initial investment of 1M USDC, with the goal to increase this allocation over the course of time.\n3. As the Aave community gains comfort in the Maple platform, the treasury will explore investment opportunities into other Maple RWA pools, pending approval from Aave’s governance.\n\n# Motivation\n\nShifting away from an exclusive focus on crypto assets, Aave is now exploring off-chain markets, particularly Real World Assets (RWA). This strategic move holds the promise of diversified treasury management, achieved through a thoughtful percentage allocation of Aave’s current USDC balance. This forward-thinking approach positions Aave to leverage RWA collateral for long-term growth, whether by enhancing liquidity, diversifying revenue streams, or capitalizing on earnings from dormant stablecoin assets.\n\nMaple Direct is excited to introduce the Cash Management Pool (MPLcashUSDC) to the Aave community. Since launching in May 2023, Maple’s Cash Management Pool has attracted >60M USDC in total deposits and generated >500k USDC in accrued interest for lenders. The Pool is permissioned and available to accredited investors who complete a KYC and AML onboarding process with Maple, with more than 50% of current lenders either DAOs or web3 corporate treasuries. Backed by short-term US Treasury bills and overnight repos, the Pool targets a net APY of the current Secured Overnight Financing Rate as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, less 50bps of annualized fees and expenses. At current rates, the spot net APY of MPLcashUSDC is approximately 4.8%.\n\nMaple’s Cash Management pool is highly differentiated from competitors, including the following benefits:\n\n- Direct Asset Security: Actively managed and directly backed by US Treasury bills held in a standalone SPV.\n- Daily Liquidity: Withdrawal function offering daily liquidity on US banking days, automated through smart contracts to ensure limited reliance on third parties.\n- Short Duration: Weighted average maturity of the Pool’s assets is capped at 30 days – this restriction materially mitigates interest rate risk and ensures reliable access to daily liquidity for lenders.\n- Yield Efficiency: Upon a new deposit, an LP token (MPLcashUSDC) is atomically transferred to the lender’s wallet and yield starts accruing immediately. Lenders continue earning interest up until the moment their LP tokens are redeemed from the pool for USDC. Fees and expenses total 0.5% annualized and there are no upfront subscription or redemption costs.\n- On-Chain, Verifiable Position: Maple’s smart contract infrastructure has been built out over the last 3 years and one of the major benefits it provides is a constant, verifiable Net Asset Value (NAV) for lenders. Using the ERC-4626 standard each lender can verify the value of their holdings directly on-chain and the yield that they have earned to date. Importantly, this value is generated block by block through the smart contracts and is not subject to any manual manipulation or input.\n- Regulated Counterparties: Custodial risks are minimized by partnering with established and regulated counterparties. The Pool’s prime broker is StoneX, a SEC and FINRA regulated broker dealer. BNP Paribas, the fifth-largest global custodian with over $10 trillion in assets under custody, is the underlying custodian for the StoneX account.\n- Fully Ringfenced: As with all pools on Maple, the Cash Management Pool represents a distinct smart contract and Lenders are ringfenced from credit risk in other pools on the Maple platform. Lender deposits in the Pool are held in a non-custodial smart contract and Maple never takes possession.\n\n# Specification\n\nIf the proposal is approved, Maple Direct is prepared to work hand in hand with the Aave DAO to engage counsel and determine the appropriate legal structure for the DAO to access KYC permissioned defi, including the Cash Management pool (and other alternatives on the platform). Maple would be responsible for onboarding the eventual legal entity associated with the Aave DAO, and would draw upon experience working with other DAOs in the space to complete KYC in a compliant manner.\n\nThe investment process will be gradual and thoughtful, with community approval sought for each stage after the endorsement of this proposal. Initially we propose a 1M USDC deployment in the Maple’s Cash Management Pool.

        "body": "**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA\n\n**Author:** @Khan \n\n**Date:** Sep 12, 2023\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal brings on Centrifuge as a service provider to the Aave DAO to setup a legal structure to support RWA investments, develop RWA specific management and governance processes, and allocate $1M of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings to a liquid US T-Bill fund on Centrifuge, as a proof of concept investment.\n\nThis is a first step towards a long term effort for Aave to develop and launch an RWA Facilitator that will back GHO with Real World Assets. With this proposal Aave can earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in the RWA industry.\n\nThe proposal minimizes upfront cost and completely recoups the initial investment within 6-12mo and starts earning yield for Aave within the first 3mo. It locks up no long term capital and leaves the DAO in full control over the treasury allocation.\n\nThe main results of this proposal:\n1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave protocol to invest in RWAs.\n1. Through Prime, the Aave Treasury will allocate $1M of USDC to the Anemoy LTF, a short-duration US treasury bill pool on Centrifuge.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, ignoring the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets for various reasons.\n\nToday, with roughly 17% of the treasury in stablecoins (~13m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of recurring revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment. These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.\n\nBeyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime is purpose-built for DeFi native organizations, offering the critical services and infrastructure necessary to onboard a diverse portfolio of RWA through a single interface.\n\nCentrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams.\n\n### **Specification**\n\n#### **Setting up the Aave DAO Legal Conduit**\nThis proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure for the benefit of the Aave DAO that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave token holder vote.\n\nThe process for establishing the legal framework is as follows: The Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Aave DAOs interests. The legal structure itself will be established per the previously discussed legal framework developed by Centrifuge. The defining documents and legal agreement team will be created to incorporate specific processes around the DAOs interaction with the foundation company. The results of this work will be presented to the Aave DAO, an analysis from the external counsel will be provided, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, likely via Snapshot or other requisite process as requested by the community.\n\nThe legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance through a process defined in the legal documents, is capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO full legal recourse to their investments. The legal counsel, while required under local Cayman law, is retained for the purposes of having an independent legal party to protect Aave’s interest.\n\nThe structure defines the actions the foundation can take, such as initiating investments or redemptions. Any action can be made only with approval from the DAO and providing a DAO approved “resolution” to the Foundation entity described above instructing the Foundation to act in accordance with the resolution. The specific details of this process will be developed alongside the Aave community.\n\nThis framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures 1. There, the same structure is used to support a >$1.2B debt ceiling, with >600m+ actively deployed.\n\nMore information on the fund, the legal framework, and the processes described here can be found in the [on going FAQ discussion here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n\n#### **Initial pilot investment in Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund**\n\nOnce the legal structure has been defined and implemented, a specific DAO resolution will be presented to the DAO that instructs the Foundation to perform a 1M investment into the Anemoy LTF and transfers 1M USDC from the DAOs treasury into the Anemoy pool onchain.\nCentrifuge will work with Aave to do an initial test investment and then a partial redemption to test out the complete rails.\n\n#### **Scaling beyond the first transaction**\n\nIt is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. This proposal creates an initial deployment into the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund of $1M (pending DAO approval at the time investment). It is up to the community to initiate further investments, but we recommend keeping RWA allocations at a fixed cap of the overall Aave balance sheet until the community is more comfortable.\n\nFrom there on, further investment and redemption actions are in full control of the Aave DAO. The process can easily be integrated to support portfolio and allocation decisions made through a more formal treasury management process, either manually or programmatically. Centrifuge is committed to supporting these efforts for the duration of this proposal’s stream.\n\nOutside of US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes in the future:\n\n| Bucket| Description | Target Return | Liquidity\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Liquid | Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds| 5-6% | Daily\n| Preservation | Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc. | 6-8% | 3-6 months\n| Acceleration | Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets | 8-20% | 3-24mo |\n\n#### **Summary Process**\nIn summary, the following process will be executed through this proposal:\n1. Acquire Caymans Legal Counsel\n1. Conduct initial legal research and analysis alongside counsel, share to forum\n1. Post proposed legal documents and legal arrangement to forum, host community call, gather and implement community feedback. Arrangement will include explicit processes for management of the foundation company (i.e. investments and redemptions).\n1. DAO approval of legal implementation\n1. Foundation company onboards to Anemoy LTF\n1. DAO proposal request for 1m of USDC investment into Anemoy LTF\n\n\n**Estimated Timeline & Project Phases**\n\n\n| Activity | Description | Est. Time |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Legal setup | Creation of Foundation Company, passing of DAO resolutions to start deployment into RWAs | 1-2 months\n| Initial Deployment | DAO instructs Foundation to deploy $1M into a US Treasuries Fund and transfers $1M in USDC Stablecoins into the Anemoy LTF | 2-3mo\n| Scaling up / Ongoing Operation | DAO can vote on increase allocation to Prime and direct investments towards a variety of liquid lower yielding and more longer term investments at any time | After 3mo\n\n#### **Fees**\nWhile there are some legal setup costs that have to be covered by the DAO upfront we limit these as much as possible.\n\nEven at a conservative deployment of just $2M and a portfolio return equal to current US Treasury yields Aave should break-even within the first 6mo and start generating revenue for the DAO thereafter.\n\nThe legal work will be useful far beyond this initial proposal and can be the basis on which Aave onboards RWAs into GHO.\n\n**Fees**\n| Fee | Amount | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Legal Setup | up to 50,000 USDC | To be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Aave DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the Aave treasury.\n|Portfolio Fee | 0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M | Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintaining the portfolio\n|Aave Reward | 500 stkAave streamed over 2 years into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first 1M UDSC Deployment into Centrifuge Prime |To cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.\n\n### **Summary of changes & discussion with the community since the Temp Check**\n* In discussion:\n    * Provided more details on the legal framework\n    * Provided more details on the Anemoy LTF\n    * Hosted individual and group calls with active delegates and voting participants to answer questions and provide further context\n    * Hosted a public Twitter Space\n* In this ARFC:\n    * Modified the proposal to focus primarily on an initial 1m RWA investment, with further investments explicitly out of scope\n    * Specified Aave Reward to be paid out only upon deployment of the initial investment\n    * Further explanation of legal constructs\n    * Further explanation on use of funds\n    * Defined a more detailed and explicit process for the establishment of the legal framework\n    * Defined a more detailed and explicit process for the initial 1m investment\n    * Breakout of proposal delivery steps and phase\n### **Additional Resources**\n* [Temp Check Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-treasury-proposal-for-rwa-allocation/14381)\n* [Further Discussion and Q&A](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n* [Centrifuge Prime Announcement](https://medium.com/centrifuge/introducing-centrifuge-prime-real-yields-real-defi-b97a0e767f18)\n* [A Discussion on a GHO Real World Asset Facilitator](https://governance.aave.com/t/a-discussion-on-a-gho-real-world-asset-facilitator/11908/5)\n### **Disclaimer:**\nThis proposal is written by a member of the k/factory team, a core contributor to the Centrifuge protocol.\n### **Next Steps:**\nUpon approval, Centrifuge will work with the DAO to implement and execute the AIP.\n### **Copyright:**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Funding Update\nauthor: \n@TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @scottincrypto \n@r3genFinance - @Elliott_r3gen, @Pepperoni_Jo3_r3gen\ncreated: 2023-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
