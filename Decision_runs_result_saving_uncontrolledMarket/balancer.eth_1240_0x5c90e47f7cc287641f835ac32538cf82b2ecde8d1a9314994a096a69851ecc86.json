        "body": "**A Stable and Autonomous DeFi Ecosystem**\n\n**SUMMARY/TLDR;**\nDUCATA requests to join the Balancer Partnership Program and requests an exception to the open-source license, similar to Gyroscope, to protect the DUCA Reflexivity Protocol. DUCATA’s innovative protocol aims to provide stability and liquidity through protocol-owned liquidity, leveraging parts of Balancer’s V2 code. The partnership will benefit Balancer by showcasing its capabilities and supporting financial innovation as well as monetary compensation and DUCATA in reducing development time and leveraging Balancer’s proven technology. DUCATA is committed to a transition towards full decentralisation and proposes a licensing fee to support Balancer’s development. With your support, we can build a more stable and autonomous DeFi ecosystem.\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, the Partnership Program will still be subject to successful due diligence and mutual assent to terms in a licensing agreement. \n\n---\n\nThe DUCA Protocol operates on a unique model where value is derived from market perceptions and demand-supply dynamics, independent of external collateral. This approach uses reflexivity to maintain a dynamic balance between market demand and protocol supply, fostering stability even amidst volatility. DUCATA’s goal is to solve the stablecoin trilemma and create the first viable form of **Programmatic Money** with the DUCA Reflexivity Protocol.\n\n**STABILITY THROUGH INNOVATION**\nThe DUCA Reflexivity Protocol ensures continuous capital flow throughout the system, not by pegging to a fixed FIAT value but by maintaining liquidity under all market conditions. This is achieved through protocol-owned liquidity, made possible by Balancer’s infrastructure, ensuring stability and reducing dependency on external liquidity providers.\n\n**WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT**\nTo maintain the integrity and operational autonomy of the DUCA Protocol, we require an exception to Balancer’s open-source license. This exception is vital to protect our unique business model and prevent unauthorised copies that could undermine our efforts and the benefits we aim to deliver. We understand the importance of open-source principles. This exception is likely a temporary measure to ensure the protocol’s integrity, with a clear roadmap towards full decentralisation where the community will decide on the DUCA protocol’s software status.\n\nBecause we believe in commitment to our collaboration with the Balancer Community, we commit to a payment for a licensing fee to use the Balancer V2 code for the DUCA Reflexivity Protocol. As a usual transaction-based fee would compromise the unique mechanism of DUCATA, we propose to pay a periodical continuous fixed technical licensing fee to Balancer. This fee will help support the continued development and maintenance of Balancer’s infrastructure, which is crucial to the success of the DUCA Protocol. We propose the following annual license fee structure:\n\n* An annual flat fee of 250K per year for unlimited deployment, also paid in equal monthly amounts\n\nDUCATA aims to launch on the Arbitrum Layer 2 with a first expansion on Ethereum Main.\n\n**BENEFITS TO THE BALANCER COMMUNITY:**\n1. Protocol-Owned Liquidity: The DUCA Reflexivity Protocol relies on protocol-owned liquidity, made possible through Balancer’s infrastructure. This ensures a stable and reliable liquidity source, reducing dependency on external liquidity providers. A unique application of the Balancer code-base that will showcase and further propel the innovations possible.\n2. Supporting Innovation: This collaboration is a cornerstone for creating a new financial system. By integrating DUCATA, Balancer becomes part of the foundation for a new, innovative approach to DeFi and a new form of money: Programmatic Money. A fully on-chain, crypto-native and autonomous form of money that protects purchasing power and generates sustainable yield.\n3. Promoting Ecosystem Growth: The success of DUCATA and its unique stability mechanisms will enhance the reputation of Balancer as a platform that supports pioneering projects. Just as Balancer’s collaboration with CoW demonstrated significant benefits, we foresee similar or greater success with the DUCATA partnership, driving innovation and growth.\n\n**OUR COMMITMENT TO THE DEFI ETHOS AND BALANCER**\nWhile our immediate need is to protect the protocol through a proprietary license, we are committed to a gradual transition towards a more open and decentralized approach. Our long-term vision includes launching a DAO, and ensuring that all future decisions, including licensing, are governed by the community.\n\nDUCATA agrees to protect the resiliency of the DAO and promote its growth by adhering to basic ecosystem standards.\n\n1.

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/334)\n\nAuthored by: @gareth & @Tristan345\n\n# Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nThis proposal deals with the Product Development element housed in the OpCo. The initial discussion is at [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Product should be considered as a part of this proposal. This proposal has been adapted to incorporate feedback from that forum discussion and includes more details around the evolution from Front-end and Design to a more holistic Product model. In particular, a Product Vision section has been added and the Goals section has been updated to align our work more closely with protocol objectives. The proposal period has been reduced from 12 months to 9 months, and the budget has been tightened.\n\nFor reference, the Administrative and Operations element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923).\n\nThe revised proposal for Product seeks approval for 723,525 USDC, compared with 1,139,544 USDC for the previous version. The table below shows the bridge between the previous proposal budget and the revised proposal. Reducing the period to 9 months cut the forecast by 316k USDC down to 824k USDC. This also reduces the BAL request from 38,020.83 BAL to 28,958.33 BAL. We have further trimmed the proposal by 100k USDC to a final figure of 724k USDC.\n\n \n![bip351-1.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvwwaoop35udm3bqga4nnd6vir45n4kfwcymhnwe5t7bw3mxmri)\n    \n\nThe $100k reduction for the 9-month period comprises:\n\n* Dropping the FX buffer for non-USD payroll from 5% to 3%. Note that I have updated the FX rates from the mid buy/sell on xe.com to the rate used by the payroll provider in June, which moves against us slightly.\n* Cutting the allowance for unconfirmed increases in January of up to 5% down to 0%.\n* Cutting the payroll buffer for variances from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working, and hardware to zero.\n* Cutting the budget for TRM API calls of $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.\n\n# Product Development Workstream\n\nThis section has been removed from snapshot to adhere to the max. Character limit. Read about the full details on the forum.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nNine months - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through March 2024 (Q1 FY24) divided into three quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these three quarters. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be available to the DAO, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal.\n\nWe note that the Product team are employees/contractors under OpCo. Should DAO Governance vote to restructure the Product team, for example, change who maintains the front-end or for OpCo to cease hosting the front-end, OpCo policy is to provide staff severance equal to the requirements of local labour law in their jurisdiction, subject to a minimum of one month’s notice.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![bip351-2.png](ipfs://bafkreidscjaz2kkqlxc43hzv2orkewcycoswtzve5p7uxbje2ij5ndxrla)\n    \n\nA breakdown of the Product Dev People costs is here:\n\n \n![bip351-3.png](ipfs://bafkreihnvr76puowmubfmhlobuiegc5m5ponjpckhmmttdcdicqoch5ksi)\n    \n\n### Requests for USDC:\n\nThe OpCo holds funds saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3 FY23. We propose that USDC funding needs for Product be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the nine months of the Product proposal.\n\nQ3 FY23 - USDC 240,744 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ4 FY23 - USDC 241,975 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ1 FY24 - USDC 240,775 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nQ3 FY23 - 28,958.33 BAL - for transfer after the snapshot vote, if successful.\n\n### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe projected spend associated with this proposal can be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb from year 1, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.\n\nFor objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 12.3% of combined current unallocated funds at OpCo, and current DAO Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).\n\n### People Costs - Product\n\nPeople Costs are comprised of remuneration and employment costs for the developers. Remuneration is currently denominated in USD, AUD, GBP, and EUR. Exchange rate fluctuations against the US Dollar will impact the actual results. We have built a 3% buffer on FX rates.\n\nThere is also a buffer to cover small unexpected variances in employment costs. As mentioned, this has been cut from 10% to 1%, which includes cutting staff allowances for phone, internet, co-working and hardware to zero. Any unused amounts will either be rolled into the next funding proposal or returned to the DAO.\n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting 28,958.33 BAL for the nine-month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. These BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 4-year vesting period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff, or return to the DAO Treasury.\n\n### Non-People Costs - Product\n\nNon-People Costs Product consists of software subscriptions to front-end development tools and TRM. These costs have reduced significantly from year one. New additions to the cost structure relate to the design element, proposed to be housed in OpCo from 1 August 2023.\n\nAlchemy is the largest line item at $2,945 per month or $35,340 for the period. The TRM annual subscription runs until May 2024. The annual renewal (est $30k) is outside the period of this proposal and is therefore excluded. In addition, the team is cutting the budget for TRM API calls from $20k to $0. The team is working on a lower-cost in-house solution to be implemented ASAP.\n\nThese and the other software costs depend on certain variables, including, for example, the number of users, log-ins, number of entities in the community that have access, and service calls. Some are billed monthly and others quarterly or annually, hence the changes in costs from one quarter to the next. We have estimated these figures using the best information available as of now, and recognise there will likely be variances during the year as more accurate data becomes available and actual costs become known. The team continues to monitor the usage of these services in order to reduce fees, and where possible negotiate more favourable rates - noting that material negotiations were undertaken in year one that we continue to reap the benefits of.\n\n# ETH Address to Receive BAL:\n\n0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693, a multisig controlled by the Balancer OpCo.\n\n# Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the BalancerDAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.",

        "body": "Authored by: Tristan\n\n# Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the [Balancer Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development. This proposal deals with the Administrative and Operational (Admin & Ops) element of the OpCo. It has been discussed in detail in this [draft BIP for year 2 funding](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882) and the comments there related to Admin & Ops should be considered as a part of this proposal.\n\nThe Product Development element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal.\n\n## Administrative & Operations\n\nServing as the operating entity with which third-party Service Providers to the Balancer DAO will contract, submit invoices to, and from which they will be paid whether that be in fiat or in tokens. This role is integral to the decentralised operations of the Balancer ecosystem, and in practice supports the healthy long term functioning of the DAO and the Balancer Protocol, and helps the DAO achieve its goals.\n\nThe Balancer OpCo will operate under the direction of the Balancer Foundation, which will oversee / have responsibility for governance, corporate administration and operations. This includes hosting and managing software subscriptions and login credentials for the OpCo team and certain ecosystem-wide platforms and social media accounts. An addition for year two is in-house Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that the Ecosystem Council proposes be retained by OpCo as a new addition to the OpCo budget. As a reminder, the Foundation operates under the governance of the DAO.\n\nA little more on GRC: given their experience with the Balancer Ecosystem, we are proposing Warburton continue this role. Hours are reduced under this proposed budget. In terms of scope, Warburton will provide GRC advice to support the [Balancer Ecosystem Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409) which includes major service providers (SPs). Warburton will provide reporting to the Ecosystem Council as requested and protect confidentiality so Balancer has the ability to defend itself from unnecessary disclosure in litigation or government inquiries.\n\nGRC services will be focused on protecting the resiliency, and facilitating the growth, of the ecosystem through the Council members (and major SPs). GRC efforts will protect Balancer by focusing on further decentralization strategy and implementation, US regulatory risks and Balancer objectives to understand and proactively protect against potential threats from legal/regulatory changes. GRC will also include keeping the Ecosystem Council current on matters of regulatory changes and sentiment, monitoring the GRC program including review of marketing/comms, conflicts of interest, VASP, sanctions and exemptions/exclusions from other evolving global requirements, assessment and negotiation of material contracts for disclosed council members and SPs and management of regulatory inquiries, investigations and/or litigation and strategy for Ecosystem Council with external counsel as needed. GRC will be handled “in-house” to extent practical to minimize external counsel costs and time. Please note that this is an internal facing role that will report to the Ecosystem Council including OpCo, not directly to the DAO. The scope of hours may be expanded to cover needs as pre-approved by OpCo. Warburton would operate on a 30-day notice period.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 1 (or link to your own):\n\nYes.\n\n## Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines 3 1:\n\nYes.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget:\n\nOne year - July 2023 (Q3 FY23) through June 2024 (Q2 FY24) divided into four quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Community Hall calls and via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be returned to the Balancer Treasury, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal or other SPs.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![opco1.png](ipfs://bafkreiftgnzjubhz7bobic73bm46y7tsnkazaj6dxrupm53gpq4ctzf4x4)\n    \n\n### Requests for USDC transfers:\n\nThe OpCo holds funds due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and Orb vs their original budgets in year 1. Estimated savings at the OpCo in year one have been partially allocated to fund the [Foundation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-281-year-two-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/4713) for Q3 FY23. The final savings figure will be known in Q3. We propose that USDC funding needs for OpCo be drawn from these funds, which are estimated to cover the twelve months of the OpCo budget based on current information.\n\nQ3 FY23 - USDC 76,379 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ4 FY23 - USDC 55,979 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ1 FY24 - USDC 61,991 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\nQ2 FY24 - USDC 55,989 - cover with funds held at OpCo\n\n### Request for BAL transfer:\n\nAdmin & Ops has no BAL requirements.\n\n### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe projected spend associated with this proposal (and that of the Product Development Team for a possible 9-month proposal) can both be covered by projected savings at OpCo and Orb, since we now have more recent data on those projections. Thus OpCo does not require any funding from the DAO Treasury to fund this proposal.\n\nFor objective comparison, the Treasury currently holds [~4.5M in USDC](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/year-2-sp-funding-impact-analysis/4921). OpCo holds ~1.4M in unallocated USDC (resulting from the savings mentioned), together ~5.9M in USDC. Funding this proposal for the year would cost around 4% of combined current unallocated OpCo funds and current Treasury USDC (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).\n\n### Non-People Costs - Operations & Administration\n\nThe main items in this section are legal and compliance costs (more below), monthly bookkeeping service (we continue to perform the “CFO” element in house for the foreseeable future in order to keep costs down). We have included a $20,000 estimate in Q3 for Directors and Officers insurance - actual costs could be materially different. Software subscriptions included here are for operations (G-suite, QBO) and ecosystem-wide services such as Dune Analytics, Discourse, Slack, Notion and Asana. Q3 2023 includes a one-off amount of $10,000 in case a deposit is required for a new bank account.\n\nThe largest increase relates to in-house Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that the Ecosystem Council proposes be retained by OpCo as a new addition to the OpCo budget, effective 1 August, 2023. As mentioned, we are proposing Warburton continue this role. Hours are reduced under this budget compared with year one, to a fixed monthly fee of $10,500, or $115,500 for 11 months. If this needs to be revisited it will be dealt with in a future proposal.\n\nThe total amount sought for Non-people costs, Operations and Administration is USDC 250,338. Broken down by category:\n\n* Administrative costs: USDC 11,800 - Registered Office/Agent, Registrar of Companies Fees, Annual Compliance Services, Bank fees, Gas fees, hardware wallet if needed.\n\n* Directors’ and Officers’ insurance: USDC 20,000 (estimate)\n\n* Establishment of new banks account(s): USDC 10,000 (estimate)\n\n* Internal GRC - total for the year (11 months in this case) USDC 115,500. This represents the minimum internal GRC support required for the items mentioned in the proposal - that is - the day-to-day of the operations. To keep the budget lean, we have removed the proposed buffer budget that was in the previous draft. \n\nThe fixed part of the proposed GRC amount represents 20 hours per month (roughly 5 hours per week) at USCC 525 per hour. This is the USDC 10.5k per month. For baseline, Warburton is currently contracted to Balancer at 20 hours per week (not through OpCo) and is fully occupied. This budget is a 75% reduction in time, and therefore yet to be seen how it works. We have edited this proposal to remove the buffer, and will raise a specific proposal should the need arise on a specific matter.\n\nThere is a cost benefit of having someone experienced that can cover multiple issues, jurisdictions, entities and topics - for illustration one person’s hourly rates vs having multiple specialists and having two or more lawyers on a call, all charging per hour. With this proposed arrangement, GRC would support the Foundation, OpCo, B Labs, Beets, Maxis and other members of Ecosystem Council as well as major SPs. This resource would not just be dedicated to providing services to one entity.\n\n* The estimate for external GRC is USDC 24,000 for the year. \n\n* Bookkeeping / Accounting services estimated at USDC 24,000 for the year (USDC 2,000 per month). This also is a very low budget given industry comparables, but we are hopeful of achieving this.\n\n* Software services for the Ecosystem and OpCo administration USDC 45,038\n\n# ETH Address to Receive Funds:\n\nNot necessary as this proposal can be covered by funds currently held at the Balancer OpCo.\n\n# Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this is internal / for the OpCo itself.",
