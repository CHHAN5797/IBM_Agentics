Created to improve accessibility & support decentralization of Ethereum by allowing anyone to spin up a validator with just a 4 ETH bond (the lowest in the industry and 80% lower than solo staking), ETHx is currently at [$500M+ TVL (130K ETH)](https://dune.com/stader_labs/ethx-general-metrics) across [4,000+ validators spread over 250+ Node Operators](https://dune.com/stader_labs/node-operator-dashboard)\n\n> stETH is a rebase token by Lido that also represents staked ether but instead of the exchange rate accumulation method, the staking rewards are given as extra stETH. Effectively, stETH always stays pegged 1:1 with ETH and stETH token balances are updated when the oracle reports the change in the total (initial deposit + staking rewards) every day. wstETH is the wrapped version of regular stETH which allows for stETH accumulation in the contract and turns the rebase model of stETH into the C-token model of other LSTs\n\n## Motivation\n\n> As an LST player, Stader is always on the lookout for more avenues to improve the liquidity depth in the market and intends to expand its current set of Balancer pools. This move is geared towards improving the retail traction in LPs while enhancing the trading experience\n\n## Specifications\n \n1. **Governance:** Stader’s governance is led by the Stader DAO - a wide variety of $SD holders who participate in key decisions pertaining to the protocol. Here are the [Stader Governance Forum](https://forum.staderlabs.com/?_gl=1*3ops13*_ga*ODUwODI0OTEyLjE2NDkzMzkzOTE.*_ga_RJZMMEBJQ5*MTY4ODM5NDk2Mi4xNDMuMC4xNjg4Mzk0OTYyLjAuMC4w) & [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/staderdao.eth#/staderdao.eth)\n\n   ETHx has an Oracle Node Operator Genesis Committee of 7 distinguished community members composed of top validators and esteemed Ethereum community members. You can learn more about the ETHx ONO committee[ here](https://snapshot.org/#/staderdao.eth/proposal/0x704905672648882c229480d501ab7d59da94ade47762eda163e7a3919082b044)    \n\n2. **Oracles:** \n\n   * [ETHx Rate Provider](https://etherscan.io/address/0xED65C5085a18Fa160Af0313E60dcc7905E944Dc7) - Already [reviewed by Balancer](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/ETHxRateProvider.md) in the past\n   * [wstETH Rate Provider](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768#code)\n\n3. **Audits:** Stader’s audit reports from Sigma Prime, Halborn & Code4rena can be found [here](https://staderlabs.gitbook.io/ethereum/ethx-security/audit-reports)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Stader is a non-custodial & decentralized liquid staking solution based on DAO governance. $SD is Stader’s native governance token. ETHx is based on the foundation of decentralizing Ethereum with permissionless node operators getting the majority of the TVL\n\n   The ETHx contract upgrades are managed by Admin time-lock contract with a 6 on 9 Multi sig (2 Stader members and 7 external members) as the proposer. Composition of the committee can be found [here](https://www.staderlabs.com/blogs/ethereum/staders-ethx-now-live-on-mainnet/)\n\n   You can learn more about how Stader envisions embracing the path of decentralization [here](https://blog.staderlabs.com/embracing-decentralization-for-ethx-5f863704b07)\n\n5. **Market History:** ETHx, like all of Stader’s prior LSTs went live with redemptions enabled from Day 1. So, the ETH is not locked and can always be redeemed by unstaking & withdrawing on Stader Dapp anytime which ensures the peg at all times and can be observed [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stader-ethx)\n \n6. **Value:** This is a Core Pool which will generate revenue for the DAO via the ETHx yield and through swap fees once the pool scales to a considerable TVL that can drive substantial trading volumes\n \n## Technical Specifications\n\n* **[Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xb91159aa527d4769cb9faf3e4adb760c7e8c8ea700000000000000000000067c)**\n* **[Pool Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb91159aa527d4769cb9faf3e4adb760c7e8c8ea7)**\n* **[Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0xAC08fde28aa2D123B61a5dB3074cAF72760FfeEB)**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n* **gauge(address):** `0xAC08fde28aa2D123B61a5dB3074cAF72760FfeEB`\n* **gaugeType(string):** `Ethereum`",

They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * wstETH is a wrapped version of regular stETH, while wETH is a wrapped version of Ethereum.\n> * swETH is an ERC-20 token that represents a user’s staked ETH in the Ethereum blockchain inclusive of any accrued rewards and penalties from the consensus layer, and MEV and ‘tips’ from the execution layer. The amount of swETH held will not change over a period of time but the underlying value of the token will increase as the rewards accrue on chain. - [Swell](https://docs.swellnetwork.io/swell/system-design/staking-with-sweth/sweth-token)\n> * The E-CLP uses an internal conversion to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> **We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles:** Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds:** The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n> \n> For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs view: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n> \n> E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).\n\n## Specifications\n\n> ### Governance\n> \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n> ### Oracles\n> \n> * rateProvider0 (for wstETH): [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768#code)\n> * rateProvider1 (for swETH): [0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n> ### Audits\n> \n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n> ### Centralization vectors\n> \n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n> ### Market History\n> \n> C.f. contracts.\n\n> ### Value\n> \n> As per “Motivation”. Other Ethereum Balancer pools with these assets exist, but none of them feature asymmetrically concentrated liquidity. Asymmetric concentrated liquidity for these assets could become a substantial driver of trading volume and total value locked.\n\n> ### Contracts\n> \n> * swETH/wstETH E-CLP: [0x127ECc2318d002664cc4515C9f2B22B09b6aea85](https://etherscan.io/address/0x127ecc2318d002664cc4515c9f2b22b09b6aea85#readContract)\n> \n> * Mainnet gauge: [0x17748Aa07A6a1Be2ACE8bCC546919C006B40De34](https://etherscan.io/address/0x17748Aa07A6a1Be2ACE8bCC546919C006B40De34)\n\nSpecifcation:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x17748Aa07A6a1Be2ACE8bCC546919C006B40De34`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/915\n\n**Summary:**\n> * This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for WETH/wstETH on Polygon zkEVM.\n> * The underlying pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IAVN7mDiPt4teeuBUMqi0KJdZ2aiRWwGAxRhJU75TB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> * Lido’s wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * WETH is an ERC-20 version of ETH. - [WETH](https://weth.io/)\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n>\n> * Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n>\n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. A similar E-CLP to the one mentioned in this proposal has been recently deployed on Arbitrum. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\n> The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n**Oracles:**\n> * rateProvider0 (for WETH): 0x00\n> * rateProvider1 (for wstETH): [0x8dd590Ebb702C21A41289A0a69B0C6F74BdeCE75](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x8dd590Ebb702C21A41289A0a69B0C6F74BdeCE75)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n**Audits:**\n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports) (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n**Market History:** \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n \n**Value:** As per “Motivation”. \n\n**Contracts**\n> * WETH/wstETH E-CLP: [0xe58cD0C79CDff6252476b3445BEE1400503e0aE0](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0xe58cd0c79cdff6252476b3445bee1400503e0ae0)\n> * Childchain gauge on Polygon zkEVM: [0x8dd928a3Aa0274bBA3b42DD9F41756AaF1e78b2f](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x8dd928a3Aa0274bBA3b42DD9F41756AaF1e78b2f)\n> * Polygon zkEVM root gauge on Ethereum: [0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F)\n\n**Technical specification**\n> The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n> gauge(address): `0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F` \n> gaugeType(string): `PolygonZkEvm`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/489\n\n> # Proposal by Gyroscope for a wstETH/WETH E-CLP on mainnet\n\n> ## Summary\n> \n> * **This is a proposal to enable a 10% capped Balancer gauge for a wstETH/WETH pool on Balancer Ethereum.**\n> * **The pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP)**. E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception**. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n> * T**he pool has already been launched [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf01b0684C98CD7aDA480BFDF6e43876422fa1Fc1#code).**\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * Lido's wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * WETH is a wrapper-token and an ERC-20 token representing ETH at a 1:1 ratio.\n> * The E-CLP uses an [internal conversion](https://github.com/gyrostable/vaults/blob/main/contracts/eclp/GyroECLPPool.sol#L723) to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> * We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency compared to the largest, existing [StableSwap pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x32296969ef14eb0c6d29669c550d4a0449130230000200000000000000000080). The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\n> * *The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are illustrated by the recently deployed stMATIC/wMATIC E-CLP. The below box plot shows stMATIC/wMATIC liquidity utilisation. The stacked area chart shows how the E-CLP already reached up to 55% of the total market share of stMATIC on Polygon soon after inception, with only a fraction of total TVL.*\n> \n>  ![gyro1.png](ipfs://bafkreifpe3brj7btgkabof7if2zrm2huyd62xjky223schjnnkzo5d6fia)\n> \n>  ![gyro2.png](ipfs://bafybeifiprubxky4vdikxilkbt5joms4aaihk2b2r25jruimh6jb6xf6bu)\n> \n> * E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).\n\n> ## Specifications\n> \n> > * **Governance**\n> > \n> >   The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n> > * **Oracles**\n> > \n> >   rateProvider0 (for wstETH): [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768)\n> > \n> >   rateProvider1 (for WETH): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n> > \n> >   (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n> >*  **Audits**\n> > \n> >    Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports) (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports).
