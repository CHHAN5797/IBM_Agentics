The protocol's TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.\nThe Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.\nThis has allowed the Aave DAO not only to \"cover its own bills\" but also has built [a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury).\n\n \n![treasury.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihrskqratcejxrmldlzopv4lj42esks3cgel2kugnd3ijzlt4leui)\n    \n\nAdditionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol's net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH & ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main & new markets.\n\nWith the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol's maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.\n\nThis journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.\n\nTo ensure the DAO's long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.\n\n## Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift\n\nThe Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.\n\nFortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of \"cash\" DAO treasury funds.\n\nHowever, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.\n\nWith both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:\n\n1. The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.\n2. The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.\n\nWhile it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.\n\nTherefore, Umbrella proposes:\n\n1. Segregation of coverage\n2. Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity\n\nFrom now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.\n\nUmbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role & benefits of the AAVE assets & tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey\n\nAs an initial and immediate step:\n\nWe propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.\n\nWith this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.\n\nGHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets' debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.\n\nHowever, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.\n\nSafety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO <> GHO exchange rate, but it's a risk they willingly accepted by staking.\n\nExample: If there's 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).\n\nThis paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.\n\nThis will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.\n\nThese changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.\n\nWe propose adopting the following:\n\n### Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:\n\n1. The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.\n2. The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.\n3. The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.\n4. Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol \"local\" net excess revenue.\n\n\n### StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey\n\nGHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.\n\nCurrently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.\n\nWe propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.\n\nThe Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.\n\nThis will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a \"base yield\" paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an \"Airdrop\" yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining \"boosts\" of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable \"base yield\" for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.\n\nIn practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.\n\nThis will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.\n\n## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.\n\nAAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it's simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.\n\n### End the \"Seize and Sell\" Doctrine\n\nThe \"seize and sell\" doctrine is dangerous as it's inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.\n\nAdditionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.\n\nLastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.\n\nWe propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.\n\n### StkBPT Redefinition\n\nThe Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE's secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.\n\nWhile the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.\n\nThe DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.\n\nWe propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a \"Buy & Distribute\" program funded by the protocol's excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.\n\nThe ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.\n\nThis will increase the Safety Module's budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.\n\nIn this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.\n\n### Introduction of Anti-GHO\n\nCreating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.\n\nWe propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.\n\nThe users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user's will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.\n\nAnti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:\n\n1. Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt \"for free.\"\n \n![burn anti gho mint.png](ipfs://bafkreifvldjg2ivjc3x7li4hmv4v4bde5xii6p6vwnlm6cdh62zgtlwv5m)\n    \n\n2. Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.\n\n \n![holders stkaave.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibylsxdbvqvwllrvmkd3x6b7e6dqcvuo6tnbevzz5g7jppb2hjp7a)\n    \n\n\nBoth special-purpose facilitators' \"debt\" will be regularly \"cleared\" by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.\n\nThis new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.\n\n### Closing the LEND chapter\n\nNearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.\nAfter a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.\n\nWe consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.\n\n## Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics\n\nThe Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.\n\nAdditionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.\n\nThe paradigm shift to \"seize and burn\" instead of the current \"seize and sell\" increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.\n\nThis is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.\n\nMost of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.\n\nTherefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.\n\nThis allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.\nBecause debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.\n\nTo cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.\n\naTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.\n\nUmbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.\n\nDetails and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk & Finance teams.\n\nWe’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.\n\n### Activate a \"Buy & Distribute\" Program\n\nWith the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.\n\nIn terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a \"Buy & Distribute\" program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.\n\nThere's little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it's a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.\n\nIt is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.\n\nRewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.\n\nWe propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the \"Buy & Distribute\" program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program \n\nFor an easier understanding of the new AAVEnomics vision, please consider the following visual representation:\n\n \n![visual representation.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigfqm7tms5yc2homzrgar6ikt6bbplco4cejmqg5i7jqngalmm2eq)\n    \n\n## “Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave\n\nAave's Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module. With the Umbrella upgrade, we expect the efficient coverage to increase significantly compared to the current situation, from a theoretical $100m to likely billions of mid-terms.\n\nThe Aave DAO can mobilize and monetize this coverage beyond the Aave protocol. The Aave DAO service providers are risk experts who can give valuable coverage recommendations to the Aave governance.\n\nThe Umbrella multi-token incentives controller allows for rewards in several tokens, and we believe this cost-efficient coverage of already existing significant liquidity will be of high interest for third-party protocols and networks, as shown by the high interest of the “Restaking” DeFi vertical.\n\nWhile the journey to maturity on this vertical is still long, the ACI wanted to share this mid-term vision to the community of a potential new journey for protocol revenue and Umbrella Stakers Yield.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Milestones and Trigger Conditions\n\nWhile the Aave protocol's net excess revenues are at an all-time high, it would be reckless to implement significant new budget spending without considering the protocol's long-term sustainability.\nFrom a user experience perspective, a too-ambitious distribution schedule being forced to halt due to more adverse revenue collection conditions will lead to massive and unwanted frustration.\nThe Aave DAO has always been a conservative actor and has always prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term yield.\n\nWe suggest considering the following elements as key data points to execute changes in Safety Modules in steps:\n\n- Aave Collector net holdings\n- Service providers' recurring budget\n- Merit and ALC program recurring budgets\n- GHO supply\n- GHO 30-day average revenue\n- Protocol 30-day average revenue\n\nThe ACI Proposes this vision to be implemented in 3 differents ARFCs to be sequentially proposed alongside reaching set milestones, we welcome governance feedback on this implementation Journey.\n\n## Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO\n\nAdoption of the Following Doctrine:\n\n1.

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] GHO Aave Savings Upgrade\n\n---\n\n**title: [TEMP CHECK] GHO Aave Savings Upgrade**\n**author: @TokenLogic @ACI**\n**created: 2025-03-04**\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks governance feedback and consensus for creating sGHO and defining the Aave Savings Rate (ASR).\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave's GHO stablecoin is growing strongly during 2025 and is the [20th largest stablecoin](https://defillama.com/stablecoins). Whilst growth to date has been strong, growing from 200M to over 300M presents a different set of challenges requiring a different approach.\n\nTo date, stkGHO launched by @ACI, rewards users for contributing to the protocol's security, has been instrumental to GHO's growth journey and currently represents 67% of GHO's circulating supply. After the Umbrella upgrade, stkGHO will remain vital to Aave Protocol's security and is expected to transition towards a size reflective of the protocol's security needs.\n\nBy sizing stkGHO to reflect the Aave Protocol's security needs, this creates an opportunity for Aave to offer a variety of risk profile yield products. This presents an opportunity for the Aave DAO to introduce a new low risk profile saving product that is expected to lead the next chapter of GHO's growth and adoption.\n\nIntroducing sGHO, a low risk savings product that rewards users for staking GHO by earning the Aave Savings Rate (ASR), that compounds over time.\n\n# sGHO\n\nBy depositing GHO into sGHO, users will earn the Aave Savings Rate by holding an ERC-20 receipt token accruing value over time which is easily integrated with other protocols.\n\nsGHO is to be sustained from revenue generated by Aave Protocol and is specifically designed to have the lowest risk profile of Aave DAO's yield product offering.\n\nThe below outlines key benefits of sGHO's design:\n\n* Interest compounding Aave Savings Rate;\n* No rehypothecation providing instance liquidity;\n* Minimal smart contract risk surface area; and,\n* No Deposit or Withdrawal Fees.\n\nA configurable Aave Savings Rate provides the DAO with sufficient flexibility to offer either a fixed or variable savings rate that moves with the broader market conditions.\n\n## Re-hypothecation\n\nTo minimise risk, deposited GHO will remain in the sGHO contract and shall not be deployed to generated yield. This ensures liquidity is always available for users to withdraw and users are not exposed to any protocol risk.\n\nWhilst depositing GHO held within sGHO appears to be the most capital efficient path, this introduces some exit liquidity risks whereby GHO deposited into a protocol can be borrowed by another user. By using a facilitator to Mint and deposit GHO into the yield source, the same capital efficiency upside can be acheived in a more controlled manner.\n\n## Facilitator\n\nWith sGHO expected to create substantial demand for GHO, facilitators are to provide liquidity for user to access GHO. stataGSMs are to provide GHO liquidity via aggregators to avoid GHO deviating from peg whilst other facilitators support GHO being borrowed into circulating supply.\n\nNew Facilitator(s) can Mint and deploy GHO to earn yield. In doing so, rather than deploying GHO held within the sGHO contract, GHO can be Minted and deployed in a controlled manner by the Gho Stewards. This approach preserves the utilisation of liquidity within reserves enabling it to be optimised for achieving a intended borrow rate and maintaining the peg.\n\nFurthermore, Minting GHO via a facilitator increases GHO circulating supply when borrowed. Overal, this approach is similar to how the Gho Stewards manage GHO and how Sky manages USDS on the Prime instance.\n\nThe process of depoloying any additional GHO facilitator(s) is controlled by DAO governance and will be handled separately to this proposal.\n\n## Supply Cap\n\nWith each unit of sGHO being minted, the Aave DAO provides a defined amount of yield that extends the DAOs financial outlay. In isolation, as the portion of GHO held by sGHO increases, the revenue derived from GHO is distributed across the larger sGHO holding base results in either the Aave Savings Rate being revised lower, or requiring additional funding to sustain the savings rate.\n\nTo facilitate processing large withdrawals from sGHO and users exchanging GHO to another asset, DEX liquidity and GSM holding balances are key to sustaining the peg. With these interwoven co-dependencies in place, a Supply Cap on sGHO is proposed. The sGHO `Supply Cap` will be maintained by the Gho Stewards.\n\n## Fees\n\nTo enhance the user experience, there are no deposit or withdrawal fees applied to sGHO. Being a yield product, creating friction via fees would act to reduce the appeal of the offering placing sGHO at a disadvantage to similar offerings available in the market.\n\n# Introductin Aave Savings Rate\n\nBefore reading on, a brief recap of some key terms referenced within.\n\ni) `Deposit Yield` = `Incentive Yield` + `Native Yield`\n\nWhere,\n\n`Incentive Yield` = Yield derived from incentives, commonly referred to as LM rewards.\n`Native Yield` = Yield derived from fees native to Aave Protocol.\n`Deposit Yield` = Total Yield user receives.\n\nAcross Aave Protocol there are two dominant stablecoins, USDC by Circle and USDT by Tether. USDT is the largest, with an emerging trend of some networks preferring to favour one stablecoin over another. Two fast growing networks, Base and Sonic both exhibit a clear bias for USDC over USDT, of which Base has generated substantial growth for Aave Protocol in recent months.\n\nWhen comparing the Native Yield of USDC and USDT across variaous instances Aave Protocol, USDC was found to exhibit a less volatile and more consistent Native Yield relative to USDT. USDC offers both strong market correlation and lower volaility relative to USDT, both are favourable qaulities for deriving a market correlated savings rate.\n\nThe chart below shows USDT and USDC Native yield across Core instances on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base and Optimism.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 19.11.02](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1tM3LGc1l.png)\n\nWhen specifically comparing USDT to USDC, the chart below provides a clear visual reflecting USDCs smoother Native yield profile relative to USDT.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 19.15.58](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1AOhUMqyx.png)\n\nThe Core instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum offers the deepest USDC liquidity and for this reason, the Aave Savings Rate incorporated the USDC Native Yield Rate from the Core instance on Etheruem as its preferred `Index Rate` .\n\nThe Aave Savings Rate definition:\n\n`Aave Savings Rate` = `Amp` x `Index Rate` + `Premium`\n\nWhere,\n\n`Index Rate` = Representative of market conditions\n`Amp` = Amplification Factor\n`Premium` = Nominal Amount\n\nA linear function provides sufficient flexibility to curate the yield to be either variable or fixed and to change the `Index Rate` to which the Aave Savings Rate is correlated to. The `Amp` can be adjusted to offset periods of low USDC utilisation, whilst the `Premium` allows for a discrete amount of extra relative yield to be applied.\n\nWhilst the Aave Savings Rate is expected to exceed the GHO Borrow Rate, the differential is to be managed such that it encourages adoption whilst being insufficent to promote arbitrage.\n\n# Beyond 200M GHO Growth Phase\n\nsGHO is the next step towards realising GHO's longer term growth potential, and with a very well capitalised balance sheet, Aave can accelerate the next chapter of GHO's growth potential.\n\nThe introduction of the Aave Savings Rate is expected to stimulate demand for GHO that will initially improve the peg and then lead to new GHO entering circulating supply via the stataToken GSMs. During the early growth phase for GHO, significant traction was achieved by aggressively incentivising growth and then tapering rewards to retain the growth.\n\nAave DAO is in a very fortunate financial position that is supportive of pursuing an aggressive growth strategy that captures the upside during what is a depressed yield market relative to late Q4, 2024. Launching sGHO with a premium to other similar savings products is expected to lead to significant growth whilst balancing the yield profile as to not overly encourage arbitraging the GHO Borrow Rate and Aave Savings Rate.\n\nThe chart below shows sUSDe, SSR, USDC Native Yield and USDS Deposit Yield on Core instance.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-02 at 16.08.50](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJloMWzjyl.png)\n\nIn terms of risk profile, sGHO is most similar to sUSDS offering from the Sky Ecosystem. For sGHO to compete, given its relative size, a premium would be required to attract meaningful amounts of capital. The USDS Deposit Yield realtive to the SSR highlights the premium for introducing Aave Protocol risk and the utility of being collateral.\n\nOn a risk adjusted basis, the Aave Savings Rate used for sGHO would fall somewhere between the SSR and USDS Deposit Yield on Aave from a competition for capital perspective.\n\nFurther details on the precise Aave Savings Rate to be used when sGHO launches will be provided in the ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\n# Sustainability\n\nDuring the expansion phase, the Aave Savings Rate is expected to present an appealing interest rate that exceeds the GHO Borrow Rate and the Native Rate of the assets held within the stataGSMs. Especially during the early growth stage, the overal economic balance of GHO revenue and costs is going to be heavily shaped by the proportion of GHO's circulating supply deposited in sGHO.\n\nThe below highlights current and near term GHO revenue sources:\n\n* GHO Borrowed via Core instance;\n* stataToken GSM holdings; and,\n* Facilitator liquidity deposits.\n\nBorrowing GHO that has been minted by a facilitor, generates revenue for the DAO through either Borrow Interest like on Core or Native Yield plus Reserve Factor fees as on Prime.\n\n## stkGHO\n\nLonger term, right sizing stkGHO reflecting the Aave Protocol's security needs, is expected to free up budget contributing to sustaining sGHO. Allocating budget from stkGHO to sGHO is exected to reduce per unit of GHO staked spend and lead to an increase in the circulating supply of GHO. This transition is expected to materially impact GHO's revenue upside.\n\nDetails relating to the optimal yield and amount of stkGHO are presented in the Umbrella forum post.\n\n## stataGSM\n\nThe rollout of stataGSMs across Ethereum, Arbitrum and Base is expected to improve the DAO's revenue streams with currently idle capital being deployed to earn yield for the Aave DAO. On Arbitrum and Base, the GSMs will provide users with the ability to `Transafer` GHO into circulating Suppy.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal is to be further refined at the ARFC stage, the following summarises the key characteristics of sGHO:\n\n* No Re-Hypothecation minimising smart contract risk;\n* Facilitators are to be used to Mint and Deploy GHO for yield;\n* No Deposit & Withdrawal Fees promoting frictionless user experience;\n* Introduce a Supply Cap to limit DAO's financial exposure; and,\n* Aave Savings Rate set by GHO Stewards determines sGHO yield;\n\nExecution and implementation is to be a collaboration between by Aave DAO service providers.\n\nThe Aave Savings Rate, budget and sGHO paramaters are to be finalised during the ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe TokenLogic team extends its sincere gratitude to all Aave service providers, delegates, and community members who contributed to this proposal’s peer review. Your expertise and insights have been invaluable in refining and strengthening this TEMP CHECK.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the [ARFC] stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "![Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 11.49.57](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rytN7ZMH6.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces @TokenLogic and @Karpatkey as the DAO’s Financial Service Provider for an initial period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 400k GHO. The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:\n\n* Treasury Management;\n* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and\n* Safety Module.\n\nThe combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Treasury Management\n\nAave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.\n\n![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI \"Chart\")\n\nIn spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.\n\n### Portfolio Volatility\n\nA significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.\n\n![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA \"Chart\")\n\n### Asset Dispersion\n\nTreasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)\n\nThe DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.\n\n### Runway\n\nAccording to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.\n\n|Category|Budget $k|Duration (mths)|Annualized Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Security¹|$1,500|6|$3,000|\n|[Risk Management](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194/8)|$1,600|12|$1,600|\n|Bug Bounty|$1,000|12|$1,000|\n|Gov.

Certora only.\n2. AGD figures based on discussions with the team.\n\nWhile there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.\n\n![|669x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Aq6xqeeq_hr2ObgV9PFBiQrn6BFRk718dJywySHO4U7jRyUXSsMDyl7CdMhdf1cGOht1143KdBZy4mEagWkrum9CBeapl2HnDnSFfRbFNaPB4-3pZH0veEu8nMoo2cAw3-uohJYNq8s8zKUn-J45spg \"Chart\")\n\nWith the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.\n\n## GHO Development\n\nAave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.\n\nAiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.\n\nWith an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).\n\n![|690x391](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7UXzX05dWaMixQmE4B-lkjHuv4-fu2jIFs8bn03_gLYG8hjpIm2mPHK4uhWVcyetMgZPUlWekoavWr1pfc43F15YuXkIZPy1r1K71mtU6WxdBl4rdzw4zMiABAUsHgRDP4d-BdkW_E-EcFgA1qArif0)\n\n![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)\n\nAs demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.\n\nFor the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:\n\n### Peg Mechanisms\n\nThere's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.\n\n### Demand\n\nThe second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.\n\n![|654x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0K9JhuF5N6ScUkxYuGisZNp4S0IQ0qfc1ZvnW59aTIzisXhXB-4w5PX_2pzyTKs9sOlZkPikzm2IPx-uC_B366JsFOyHrmVqFYdLfmef0fBEaXquwkH-f48RAzVfmM9AqARhdcJ_EIQn7IrxaMv2fU0)\n\nCurrently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.\n\n![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)\n\nIf a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.\n\nFurthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.\n\n![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)\n\nThe daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.\n\n## Why Partnering?\n\nAll of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.\n\nThere hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:\n\n* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and\n* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.\n\nThe combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.\n\n### TokenLogic\n\nWe are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.\n\nOur dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.\n\n### karpatkey\n\nkarpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.\n\nAs DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.\n\nIn addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.\n\nWe now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling\n\nWe aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s \"shortExecutor\". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n## Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;\n* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and\n* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.\n\nDo note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\nAs it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.\n\n## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee\n\nThis expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.\n  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.\n  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",

AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.\n\nFigures and calculations based on asset prices have been updated from the TEMP CHECK to reflect the current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThroughout the previous proposal, AGD has:\n\nAwarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.\n\nEngaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.\n\nProliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.\n\nExercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.\n\nThis proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:\n\nIncreasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.\n\n# Specification\n\n*History*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia5rsf2qn7obbf2y5fs6uzqdbhz74wrvh32yys76jc5a7ks2guuay)\n    \nSince its inception in May 2021 to September 2023, AGD has awarded $4,852,753 across 249 grants.\n\nFrom the last AGD proposal in January 2023 to now, AGD has awarded 50 grants and awarded 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties across four different hackathons.\n\n*Note: All $ cost amounts are calculated at time of payment, pre/post token value fluctuations are not included unless otherwise specified. Pending payments are not included.\n\nThis is the fifth proposal for AGD:\n\n- The initial proposal launched AGD in May 2021 with $1 million of total funding over two quarters.\n\n- The second proposal was executed at the end of December 2021 and funded AGD for three months with $2 million of funding.\n\n- The third proposal was executed at the end of May 2022 and funded AGD for six months with $3 million per quarter.\n\n- The fourth proposal was executed at the end of January 2023 and funded AGD for six months with $1.625 million per quarter.\n\n*Mission*\n\nAGD is a community-led grants program that supports the growth of the Aave ecosystem by:\n\n(1) Funding innovative projects backed by strong teams with creative ideas that benefit and strengthen the Aave ecosystem through products and initiatives which:\n\nIncrease TVL or other protocol metrics\n\nExpand the capabilities of the platform and utility of Aave\n\nEmpower the community with accessible and novel insights\n\nEngage new users and enhance retention of current users\n\nGrow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity\n\nAND\n\n(2) Fostering a strong and inclusive culture around Aave. Aave’s culture leads to:\n\nAttracting and retaining the best contributors, and\n\nEncouraging the development of new and creative solutions to key areas in the Aave protocol and Aave DAO.\n\n*Metrics*\n\nGrants Provided:\n\nMay 2021 - September 2023: 249 grants worth $4,845,753\n\nJan 2023 - September 2023: 50 grants worth $885,020\n\nBreakdown of grants by category:\n\nCategory - $cumulative cost - number approved\n\nApplications and integrations - $2,664,556 - 108 grants\n\nCode audits - $82,000 - 3 grants\n\nCommittees & DAOs that serve Aave’s ecosystem - $703,780 - 18 grants\n\nCommunity (marketing and educational) - $698,550 - 52 grants\n\nDeveloper tooling - $415,000 - 13 grants\n\nEvents / Hackathons / Sponsorships - $185,000 - 14 grants\n\nOther - $294,900 - 12 grants\n\nProtocol development - $474,200 - 21 grants\n\nStatus of all Grant Projects Awarded:\n\nComplete/Live - 67.6%\n\nIn-progress - 24.8%\n\nInactive - 7.6%\n\nGrowth in Community Engagement Since Last Renewal Proposal (Jan 2023):\n\nSubstack subscribers: 1,748 → 1,805 (+ 3%)\n\nTwitter followers: 13,300 → 13,400 (+ 0.75%)\n\nTelegram members: 643 → 719 (+ 12%)\n\nLens followers: 2,828 → 8,801 (+ 211%)\n\nMirror subscribers: 169 → 546 (+ 223%)\n\nKey Stats Since Inception:\n\nParticipated in 14 hackathons, awarding $150,000 in Aave and GHO specific bounties to 58 teams.\n\nMany of these teams have continued building or contributing to Aave and GHO, including five projects that went on to receive grants.\nAchieved a Net Promoter Score, a measurement to gauge the experience of grantees, of 83 based on 77 responses.\n\nAverage response to “How likely are you to recommend AGD?” is 4.8/5.\nProcessed 1,944 applications with an average turnaround time from application submission to grant decision of 9.6 days, shrinking over time.\n\nConsistently accepted applications and awarded grants to builders:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihbznvdfekheqtlzcv5vr73dy2zmc7mgrgpxamdmgdywfcmlltrbi)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiakp7rcss6vcay3t2qtb6ltmn3svlhu2bzg3gkzx3jtcqfjlfdrze)\n    \n*Since the Last Proposal*\n\nThe community has been kept up to date with AGD’s activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates, the Halfway Update, and through AGD being added to Llama’s treasury dashboard 1. The AGD website houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.\n\nThe GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.\n\n*AGD Budget*\n\nAGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,435,042. Please note: despite continuing to operate and distribute grants, the dollar value of the treasury has remained relatively flat since the TEMP CHECK due to the appreciation of AAVE and OP.\n\nPart of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihoc2iwk36ta6fqi2btkb3dsms2jteldin2w3l7w5acdxuczgon34)\n\nHere is AGD’s spend over the course of the previous proposal:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihafvtfdgespbdluqm6uv5kj2fbitjoutolsqorktozffh4tshhta)\n\n*Other Initiatives*\n\n- Increasing Grantee Accountability. There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently Defi Simulator, Projection Finance, and Aave Alarm) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.\n\n- ‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs). A pilot project has been introduced to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.\n\n- AGD Operations and Best Practices. Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiefrkqq5lsl3na4sm7hhxnwaqozsxmhvt67edyvm6sdms3iz44pke)\n\n*Grantee Highlights*\n\nSince AGD’s last proposal to September 2023, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeic5lh6oay26aff4iuyetkhxlv6uxktk73qgcbhvbv6lhvzktvtjry)\n\nHere are some recent highlights from grantees:\n\nDullahan\n\nDesigned and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and reached over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.\n\nSommelier Finance\n\nEnables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.\n\nAAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools\n\nExpands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.\n\nOther applications include: DeFi Simulator, Aave Alarm, Projection Finance and Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard.\n\nIntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO 1\n\nHelps the community understand GHO’s activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.\n\nXenophon Labs\n\nPerformed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year\n\nButter\n\nFacilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.\n\nFlexible aToken Voting ScopeLift\n\nUnlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.\n\nAwesomeQA\n\nStreamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.\n\n*Operational Focuses for this Proposal*\n\nThe path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:\n\nFinish Establishing Legal Entity\n\nEstablishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.\n\nAGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.\n\nRevamping Review Committee\n\nAGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. One idea AGD will explore is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.\n\nAGD and Service Provider Alignment\n\nWith the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.\n\nMeasuring Impact\n\nAGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as Spindl to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.\n\nStarting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.\n\n*People*\n\nAGD now has ten members.\n\nLead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.\n\nReview Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:\n\nCorbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys\n\nCalvin Chu - Impossible Finance\n\nFrancis Gowen - Flipside Crypto\n\nLawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics\n\nKakashi - Symphony\n\nAndrew Allen - Coinbase\n\nDavid Truong - x23.ai, ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev\n\nOperations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.\n\nAnalyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.\n\nCompensation:\n\nLead: $9k/month\n\nReview committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week\n\nReviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.\nAnalyst: $5k/month\n\nOperations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month\n\nDesigner and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements\n\nThe roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.\n\n*Proposed Budgets*\n\nThis proposal’s total budget will be split between a Grants Budget and an Operations Budget. In total across budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:\n\n$328,000 increase in AGD’s GHO allowance\nThis would make AGD’s treasury, including allowances: 72.2% in stables, 18.7% in AAVE, and 9% in OP\n\n$292,000 that was previously allocated to ‘Digital Marketing’ spend has been reallocated to this budget.\n\nNotably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to swap AGD’s DAI allowance with GHO. AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.\n\n*Grants Budget*\n\nCarry Forward\tAsk\tTokens for Ask\nDeveloper Grants\t$614,980\t$300,000\tStables\n$133,000\t$0\tOP\nGrants Total Budgeted Cost\t$747,980\t$300,000\t\nThe OP is based on the 100,000 OP allocated to AGD during the previous proposal.\n\nAGD will introduce a new $20k max grant size for all grants and double down on kickstarting the growth of new teams building on top of Aave and GHO.\n\n*Operations Budget*\n\nCarry Forward\tAsk\tTokens for Ask\nCompensation\t$20,150\t$300,000\tStables\nMaintenance: Tooling, subscriptions, gas reimbursements\t$526\t$20,000\tStables\nLegal Buffer\t$69,984\t$0\t\nOperations Total Budgeted Cost\t$90,660\t$320,000\t\nIncreasing the overall amount allocated to operations, especially compensation, is necessary for AGD to grow its resources and operate more independently.\n    \n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis TEMP CHECK is powered by Skywards.\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not received any form of compensation from AGD for creating this proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Safety Module Upgrade Part III - Enable gauges on BPT in Safety Module (smBPT)\ndiscussions: https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-safety-module-upgrade-part-iii-enable-gauges-on-bpt-in-safety-module-smbpt/12750\nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @dydymoon & @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-04-13\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents the community with an opportunity to improve the capital efficiency of the Safety Module (SM) by enabling deposits to earn yield from other protocols and discuss the smBPT gauges proposal.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe previous proposal presented the community with the opportunity to include LP positions in the SM. Those same LP positions can be deposited into other protocols to earn yield without the prospect of being slashed. These alternative investment options create an opportunity cost and act as a minimum APY hurdle rate when considering investing in Aave’s SM.\n\nThis publication presents an opportunity to enable participants in the Aave SM to earn rewards from other protocols whilst providing a backstop to Aave. The inclusion of GHO pools further helps provide sustained liquidity in the market and generate revenue for Aave through GHO’s borrow rate.\n\nThis introduces the prospect of increasing the sustainability of the SM by enabling rewards to scale with TVL over time which is currently solely dependent upon AAVE’s price correlation with the SM’s TVL given the fixed distribution limitation.\n\nThis proposal will discuss the differences between “classic” gauges and specific ones (“smBPT gauges”) as outlined in the [intro post](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029/6?u=dydymoon), and will introduce the strategy.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for ‘Balancer Pool Token’) for a time duration up to 1 year. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nBalancer token emission is currently at 121,930 BAL/week and decreases linearly each year.\n\nveBAL holders can vote each week to redirect part of these incentives to the pool of their choice.\n\nAt the time of writing, 1 veBAL can redirect 0.01187 BAL /veBAL vote/week ($0.0851).\n\nBy using the voting power & voting incentives, it is possible to either leverage better rewards for the similar $$ cost or similar APR rewards with reduced cost. Our calculations are based on delivering a similar APR to users whilst reducing the overall dollar spend on the SM.\n\nLike Curve, the APR of liquidity pools staked on Balancer (BPT-XX-gauge) can be boosted up 2.5x depending on several parameters, such as veBAL boost holdings, value deposited, total TVL of the pool etc. However, having the max boost requires a huge amount of veBAL, which most projects don’t have.\n\nWhile they can still buy boosts on Marketplace like Warden, it can be expensive and potentially limitate the strategy profitability. However, there are projects accumulating a considerable amount of veTokens to mutualize the boost, improving the yield for depositors.\n\nAura Finance is the biggest on the Balancer ecosystem with [27% of the veBAL held by the protocol](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/balancer). These holdings are utilized to boost the users deposits (Most of the pools are currently boosted ~1.4x).\n\nIt’s important to note that 25% of all BAL earned on Aura are captured by the protocol, which distributes AURA rewards in return, the Aura Finance governance token. More details on the AURA distribution can be found [here](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/distribution).\n\nThe AURA token can be locked for 4 months for vlAURA without decay on the voting power, which allows to participate on Aura Governance, Balancer gauges votes as it controls the underlying veBAL voting power, and can receive rewards in auraBAL & vote incentives. At this time, 1 vlAURA controls 0.2081 veBAL. Once a gauge is voted on Balancer, the pool is added on Aura Finance in the following days.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to consider staking the LPs deposited in the SM on Aura Finance, to receive BAL + AURA rewards distributed to SM depositors. However, there are different possibilities to reach this goal:\n\n## “Classic” gauges mechanism\n\nAfter a liquidity pool is created, an application is shared on the respective communities governance forum to create a gauge. Upon creation, users are able to deposit their LPs into the gauges to earn rewards.\n\nProjects like Aura Finance receive the BPTs, deposit them into the Balancer gauge and retain a portion of the BAL emission in exchange of their own governance token. Users receive an elevated yield to reward users for the additional smart contract risk and premium for replacing BAL with AURA. Aave could deploy contracts within the SM that extends this concept and enable users to receive Aura Finance and Balancer rewards.\n\nMost projects are proposing to enable the gauge on the BPT assets. This works quite well because they are creating vote incentives (often with their native token) to acquire votes in veBAL & wrappers, directing more rewards to the pool, making it attractive for the community to deposit liquidity.\n\nHowever, if Aave’s SM was to accept the BPT directly and not deposit the BPT into the Balancer Gauge. Any users could deposit & stake their BPT to receive BPT-gauge without depositing in the SM, allowing them to bypass the SM lock period and cooldown to receive the same incentives as SM depositors, so classic gauges invalidates the strategy\n\nThis would create a huge dilution for Aave, which is a large issue when the liquidity also doubles as protocol insurance. If Aave was to offer the same APR as Aura Finance there is no incentive for users to take on the additional shortfall and cool down period lock up risk/opportunity cost.\n\nIn Part IV, the SM upgrade proposal will consider using 75% of the current incentives budget for volatile & stable BPTs categories. That’s 825 AAVE/ day that could either be used to incentivize the pools directly (Not recommended to keep doing liquidity mining for all categories) or to create vote incentives for the associated gauges driving a higher rewards value to the pools.\n\nThis method can still be used for main liquidity pools outside of the SM, but to keep the proposed strategy profitable for Aave, an alternative could be what this publication will refer to as “smBPT gauges” which is a suggestion from Solarcurve.\n\n## “smBPT gauges mechanism”\n\nThe method requires implementing a wrapper in the safety module. The SM contract receives BPT from users, and deposits in the wrapper contract which would mint smBPT received by the SM.\n\nInstead of enabling gauges that accept the BPT, Balancer can approve BAL emissions to gauges which accept the smBPT. Users would have the option to deposit the BPT into Aave’s SM to mint smBPT which will be deposited on Aura Finance which then deposits the smBPT into the Balancer gauge.\n\nThis means that any users could deposit liquidity and receive the trading fees on the underlying Balancer pools, but only users who stake their BPT in the SM would be eligible to gauge rewards.\n\nIf the smBPT gauges are approved by the Balancer DAO, Aura Finance will implement the pools associated with these gauges. The gauges will only accept smBPT. This eliminates the opportunity cost as users can not deposit into Aura Finance or Balancer’s gauge directly and avoid the slashing plus cool down risk. Considering that the SM would mint the smBPT internally, it would be the only contract available to stake on this gauge.\n\nOnce deposited, the SM contract would receive “aurasmBPT-gauge” and mint “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” distributed to the initial BPT depositors.\n\nIf a user wants to withdraw from the SM, he would activate the cooldown period. The SM contract would then burn the “aurasmBPT-gauge” by unstaking from Aura Finance to receive smBPT. It would then unlock and distribute the BPT as well as burn the smBPT and “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” once the withdrawal is done.\n\nAt this point, and while several aspects of the proposals have been updated since the strategy introduction post, this chart should help understand and visualize the overall strategy described.\n\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreih2bqouhr75txq5jog2gi4xdstlorn7wb3qdhjkzhlmhem6ojn7ey)\n    \nConsidering that the veBAL voting power held by Aave is not enough to sustain these pools with good TVL, the goal is to use part of the SM rewards budget as votes incentives.\n\nThe part IV of this proposal will focus on incentives management updates and details on estimations made, while the part V will be mostly about further considerations.\n\n## smBPT Risks\n\nTo implement interoperability and integrate different protocols, several changes are needed, which will result in the upgraded SM contracts having greater smart contract risk than in the current implementation. Introducing smBPT to the SM creates additional Balancer gauge and Aura smart contract risk exposure.\n\nThe current ABPT integration demonstrates the community's willingness to have exposure to the Balancer protocol within the SM. Aave further demonstrated confidence in the Balancer <> Aave partnership via the token swap performed during 2022. Since then, Balancer has launched several liquidity pools which deposit funds in Aave v3 across several networks. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAave and Balancer have been working together since the launch of the Safety Module. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAura Finance is a protocol built on top of the[ Balancer system](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) to provide maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and BAL stakers (into[ veBAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512)) through social aggregation of BAL deposits and Aura’s native token.
