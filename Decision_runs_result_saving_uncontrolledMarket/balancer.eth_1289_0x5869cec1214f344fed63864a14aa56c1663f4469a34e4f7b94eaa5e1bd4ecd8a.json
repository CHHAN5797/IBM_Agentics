The reason we're requesting it for mainnet is so we can add 3rd party rewards in cases where the gauge will not likely be added to the veBAL voting system. \n\nIt's preferable to add 3rd party rewards through Aura when the gauge will be or is already in the voting system because it speeds up the process of \"ramping up\" emissions on the Aura side. Without BAL emissions there's no need to direct users to Aura and involve Aura governance.\n\n### Specification\n\nThe DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` with the following inputs:\n\nrole: `0x3bf29175652a3f0fac5abb715d0b7fe2e7b597e2e2eff555dac6b21a20a7c83e`\n\nwhich corresponds to the role for calling `add_reward` verifiable [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-deployments/blob/master/action-ids/mainnet/action-ids.json#L714C41-L714C107)\n\naccount: `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`\n\nwhich corresponds to the Balancer Maxi LM Multisig",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1079\n\n**Summary**\n\n>Proposal to add gauge support for the 50WAR-50WETH pool on Mainnet.\n\n**Abstract**\n\n>Our proposal aims to create on chain liquidity for WAR and introduce the first and only WAR/WETH pool on mainnet.\n\n**Protocol description**\n\n>Paladin is a DeFi ecosystem focused on governance protocols and markets, designed to unlock the value of governance. It aims to enable every DeFi stakeholder to participate in governance as they wish, building solutions around governance power. These solutions are designed to strengthen the underlying DeFi protocol by leveraging the token’s voting power or utility while creating value for token holders.\n\n>Paladin’s flagship product, Quest v2, introduces a pioneering method for boosting voting incentives across various DEXs including Balancer and Aura.\n\n>The Autovoter by Paladin optimizes voting incentives for holders of vlCVX, vlAURA, and vlLIQ, offering some of the most competitive yields available for governance tokens.\n\n>Warlord, a novel governance index, allows users to leverage vote incentives within the Convex and Aura ecosystems while automatically managing CVX and AURA positions.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n>-Website: [https://www.paladin.vote/\n](https://www.paladin.vote/)-Documentation: [https://doc.paladin.vote/\n](https://doc.paladin.vote/)-Github Page: [Paladin Finance\n](https://github.com/PaladinFinance/)-Twitter: [https://twitter.com/Paladin_vote\n](https://twitter.com/Paladin_vote)\n\n**Motivation**\n\n>WAR, the first governance index token, comprises Convex (CVX) and Aura (AURA), which are vote-locked to generate yield. Previously, the only way to mint WAR was by depositing CVX, AURA, or both, with users receiving WAR directly upon minting. To earn rewards and vote incentive yield, users had to stake their WAR. With the introduction of this Balancer pool, WAR will now be tradable on-chain, offering several advantages. Firstly, it provides a new income stream for those who wish to provide liquidity, and it boosts the yield for those who stake their WAR as the staked ratio decreases. Additionally, offering on-chain liquidity allows users to exit Warlord without waiting in the redeem queue, which can take several weeks depending on the unlock schedule of the vote-locked tokens.\n\n>To provide immediate WAR liquidity, Paladin will use its Aura voting power as well as voting incentives since DEX liquidity for PAL ever since its inception and plans to keep using governance power and PAL bribes with this new pool.\n\n**Specifications**\n\n1. **Governance**: The current Governance of Paladin is composed of a Forum to discuss Proposals, a Snapshot space to vote, and the execution of a vote is currently handled by a Community Multisig where the members are elected through the DAO voting process. The DAO has voted to switch governance to an Optimistic Council ([PIP-23](https://gov.paladin.vote/t/pip-23-switch-governance-to-an-optimistic-council/554/4))\n2. **Oracles**: The protocol does not use Oracles.\n3. **Audits**: You can find all the audits of the current products [here](https://doc.paladin.vote/deployed-contracts/audits).\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Treasury is managed by multi sigs\n5. **Market History:** WAR has not market history because it was only possible to acquire some war through a minting process.\n\n**Pool details :**\n\nPool : https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x5002eb99f569405987d56e53cec01fbb5da28968000200000000000000000696\nGauge w 2% cap: https://etherscan.io/address/0x07b914F3C6031D5499ac5bE828016b115fc68825#readContract\n\n**Existing Gauges Killing:**\n\nAs an additional measure, Paladin proposes to eliminate all remaining PAL gauges on the mainnet as part of this proposal. Currently, there are two idle gauges left on the mainnet.

This will begin the steps of Balancer getting a stronger foothold on the network, permitting vote incentives on pools, and leading to the core pool model being carried out as well. \n\n### Technical Specification:\n\n#### [Setting Gauge Factories (Mainnet) Specification Part A:](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/public/safe/safe-apps/simulator/fdac79e4-9a1a-4d73-9160-2d91e91a3ce4)\n\nThe DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the Authorizer `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` calling grantRoles passing roles (bytes32) as `0x3f44776af02a9227991da37715b44e45db40735e216b3ab33144859bb6737166` , `0x2960d085c4c968d7cad55c0da3f97014525b948fdce990ecaef4e832b5f0b151` and account (address): `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f`.

Since Aura launched one year ago, it has played a vital role in the Balancer ecosystem. Aura is now expanding to Arbitrum and other L2s to further support Balancer.\n\n# Motivation:\n\n> The synergies between Balancer and Aura are widely known. Aura is expanding to Arbitrum to support Balancer liquidity on L2s. auraBAL is the liquid wrap of veBAL. The approval of this gauge for the 55/45 auraBAL/wstETH pool will set up a successful launch on Arbitrum and provide liquidity for auraBAL. The 55/45 weight of the pool will facilitate trading and help generate more trading fees and wstETH yield for liquidity providers and the Balancer protocol, along with other core pools on Arbitrum.\n> \n> A summary and description of Aura’s intended Arbitrum deployment can be found in [[AIP-31] Arbitrum Deployment](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-31-arbitrum-deployment/504).\n> \n> The auraBAL tokens bridged to Arbitrum can be deposited into the Arbitrum auraBAL vault and benefit from auto compounding rewards, similar to Mainnet.\n> \n> All auraBAL deposited into the mainnet bridge contract (AuraBalProxyOFT) will be staked in the mainnet auraBAL vault earning yield. This yield will be periodically harvested and distributed to the sidechains. This enables an opportunity for a leverage APR based on a ratio of bridged to staked auraBAL on those supporting chains.\n\n# Specifications:\n\n > ## 1. Governance - \n> Aura is governed by the vlAura community with Snapshot as its voting platform. Aura recently adopted [AIP-27](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-27-implement-weighted-voting-for-aura/469) to enable weighted veBAL voting following Balancer’s adoption of [BIP-300](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-300-change-snapshot-to-weighted-voting/4771). It’s in the process of [expanding its delegate base](https://forum.aura.finance/t/information-about-delegates/488).\n>\n     >    * Treasury multisig (4/7): [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/eth:0xfc78f8e1Af80A3bF5A1783BB59eD2d1b10f78cA9/home)\n   > \n   > \n   >    * Protocol multisig (4/7): [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x5feA4413E3Cc5Cf3A29a49dB41ac0c24850417a0)\n> \n> \n>    * [Protocol multisig rights](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/governance/multisig-rights)\n> \n> \n>    * [Protocol and treasury multisig composition](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/governance/multisig-composition) and see [AIP-8 ](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-8-multi-sig-best-practices-framework/142)and [AIP-16](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-16-multisig-performances-updates/220)\n> \n> ## 2. Oracles - \n>  Aura does not rely on external oracles.\n> ## 3. Audits: \n> See https://docs.aura.finance/security.\n> \n> ## 4. Centralization vectors:\n> Aura is a non-custodial, non-pausable platform. The only centralization vectors pertain to off-chain Snapshot voting and the two 4/7 multisigs.\n> \n> ## 5. Market History - \n> auraBAL is now a year old. auraBAL’s main liquidity is on Balancer on Ethereum. The two pools, auraBAL Stable (50/50 auraBAL/80BAL20wETH) and 33 auraBAL (33/33/33 graviAURA, auraBAL, wETH), currently have over $22,000,000 of combined liquidity. These two will still exist on Mainnet, while this pool will serve as the primary source of liquidity for auraBAL on Arbitrum.\n>\n>    * auraBAL’s historic performance in relation to 80BAL20wETH is available at https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/balancer.\n> ## 6. Value - \n> Arbitrum already has over $11mm in wstETH/wETH liquidity that will promote swapping between auraBAL, wETH, and wstETH. In addition to providing aurabAL liquidity on Arbitrum, pairing auraBAL with wstETH 55/45 should help to further enhance the core pool incentives on Arbitrum. \n>    * A separate Temp Check will soon be posted to the Aura forum and will be contingent on this BIP passing Balancer governance. The Temp Check/AIP will seek to modify [AIP-26](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-26-optimize-aura-eth-and-aurabal-stable-incentives-to-maximize-protocol-benefit/463) by re-allocating from that AIP's prior allocations, for at leaset 10 gauge cycles, each of  ~7.5k of Aura, to be used for this pool in the manner authorized by the AIP (and on HH's Aura market on Arbitrum once launched by HH), with the remaining Aura for each cycle to be used per the parameters of AIP-26.\n\n> \n> [Pool link](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc7fa3a3527435720f0e2a4c1378335324dd4f9b3000200000000000000000459)\n> \n> [Gauge address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x175407b4710b5a1cb67a37c76859f17fb2ff6672): `0x175407b4710b5A1cB67a37C76859F17fb2ff6672`\n> \n> \n> Subject to 2% emission cap.\n\n> **Transaction Specification:**\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x175407b4710b5A1cB67a37C76859F17fb2ff6672`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

This proposal contains four pools which are being migrated from their old gauges to new ones. The primary purpose of migrating the gauges is to utilize the Aave v3 market underneath, and also to move gauges from any pools in recovery mode to new implementations. These new gauges use the same cap percentage as the previous implementations and are compatible with the layer zero technology for cross chain boosts once the technology goes live, meaning no need to migrate these gauges in the near future. New pool gauges will be activated upon the vote passing, and gauges proposed to be killed will be executed 3 weeks from the passing of this proposal, in the case that it does. \n\nWe will be coordinating with the various bribe marketplaces to ensure all future voting incentives only go towards the new gauges. The old pools listed below will no longer have core pool status. All of the migrated pools will be restored as “core pools” under BIP-19. If a pool was not a core pool before this post, it will not become a core pool now. \n\n## Pools being migrated:\n\nOriginal deployment → New pool address\n\n[wstETH/USDC](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x178e029173417b1f9c8bc16dcec6f697bc323746000200000000000000000158) → [wstETH-BPT/bbaUSD](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x9fb7d6dcac7b6aa20108bad226c35b85a9e31b63000200000000000000000412) (Arbitrum)\n[BRZ/jBRL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xe22483774bd8611be2ad2f4194078dac9159f4ba0000000000000000000008f0) → [BRZ/jBRL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xe19ed40a47f9b0cea4ca6d372df66107758913ec000000000000000000000b41) (Polygon)\n[BRZ/jBRL / bbamUSD v2](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x4a0b73f0d13ff6d43e304a174697e3d5cfd310a400020000000000000000091c) → [BRZ/jBRL / bbamUSD v3](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xe78b25c06db117fdf8f98583cdaaa6c92b79e917000000000000000000000b2b) (Polygon)\n[frxETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x5dee84ffa2dc27419ba7b3419d7146e53e4f7ded000200000000000000000a4e) → [frxETH / bb-a-WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0xd00f9ca46ce0e4a63067c4657986f0167b0de1e5000000000000000000000b42) (Polygon)\n\n## Transactions:\n\n*To allow time for emissions to move over and all LP’s to get the full benefit of AURA emissions this BIP will be executed in two parts.
