        "body": "TLDR;\n**The TMC recommends that the DAO votes for #3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy**\n\nThe four possible combined outcomes are:\n- **#1 Deploy Both Strategies**\n- **#2 Only Deploy ARB Strategy**\n- **#3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy**\n- **#4 Deploy Nothing**\n- **Abstain**\n\nIf no ARB is deployed (#4 Deploy Nothing, Abstain win), we will make the necessary modifications and resubmit the proposal for another vote. \n\nThe vote will be conducted via Ranked Choice Voting (RCV): Rank options; results use instant-runoff counting.\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe TMC has divided the partner selection into two groups: one for managing the stablecoin allocation—which covers converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and their ongoing management—and one for managing the ARB allocation for on-chain strategies. \n\nSpecifically, the plan is to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage those on-chain, while the remaining 10M ARB is deployed on on-chain ARB-only strategies.\n\nFurther information on the TMC mandate can be found here: [Tally | Arbitrum | Treasury Management V1.2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/111105159609719390908725919603971316574753860587890014819515615630412225940809?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4)\n\n# Shortlisted Proposals\n**Stablecoin Allocation (15M ARB Equivalent)**\n- Scope: This group covers the full process of converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and managing these assets for DAO liquidity needs.\n\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n- Gauntlet\n\n*Allocation Strategy:* The stablecoin management responsibilities will be evenly split among the three partners with a 33/33/33 distribution, ensuring diversification and balanced risk exposure while meeting the conversion and liquidity objectives.\n\n**ARB Allocation (10M ARB)**\n\n- Scope: This group is focused exclusively on deploying 10M ARB tokens into on-chain strategies designed to generate yield while safeguarding the principal.\n\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n\n*Allocation Strategy:* The on-chain ARB strategy will be managed equally by the two partners using a 50/50 split. Their proposals leverage proven DeFi protocols and ecosystem synergies to maximize risk-adjusted returns while maintaining liquidity and principal protection.\n\n\n# TMC Recommendation\nWe recommend a vote of **YES for the Stablecoin Allocation and NO for the ARB Allocation**.\n\nOur analysis shows that the stablecoin strategies presented by the selected partners meet our criteria for DAO alignment, returns, risk management, etc. \n\nWhereas the current ARB proposals lack sufficient risk management and clear operational details—resulting in low yield projections—we believe it is prudent to sit out on this allocation for now.\n\n\n# Voting Outcomes\nPlease cast your vote on each allocation separately. Your options are as follows:\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with converting 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage them via a 33/33/33 split among Karpatkey, Avantgarde & Myso, and Gauntlet.\n- **No:** Do not execute the stablecoin strategy; retain current ARB holdings without conversion.\n\n**ARB Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with deploying 10M ARB into on-chain strategies, managed in a 50/50 split between Karpatkey and Avantgarde & Myso.\n- **No:** Do not execute the on-chain strategy; hold the ARB tokens.\n\nThe four possible combined outcomes are:\n- **#1 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// YES deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n- **#2 NO, do not deploy the Stable Strategy /// YES, deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n- **#3 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy**\n- **#4 NO, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy**\n\n**We recommend that the DAO votes for #3 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n\nThe vote will be conducted via Ranked Choice Voting (RCV): Rank options; results use instant-runoff counting.\n\n*Note. The first vote corresponds to the Stablecoin Allocation and the second to the ARB Allocation.*\n\n---\n\n# Other Proposals\nDuring our review process, we evaluated several proposals that ultimately did not meet the criteria, required further clarity, or didn’t align with DAO objectives. \n\n- **AnthiasLabs x XBTO:** Their proposal did not provide adequate detail on stablecoin conversion, DAO alignment, or custody arrangements, which are critical to our objectives.\n\n- **August Digital:** While proposing a single-sided AMM strategy for both ARB yield and ARB-to-USD conversion, the proposal provided minimal details. There was no evidence of existing ARB strategies or a dedicated vault, and the timeline for necessary audits—if smart contracts are involved—was not addressed. Moreover, the risk management section appeared generic, with much of the content seemingly repurposed from other contexts.\n\n- **Bracket Labs:** The submission lacked clarity on key operational components, such as the choice of OTC counterparties or DEXes. Additionally, the rationale behind the 2% trading volume figure and the associated price impact considerations were not explained. Although a Stablecoin Vault is reportedly live, the lack of public transparency and reliance on historical yield figures from related funds (rather than the target vault) were significant concerns, compounded by high fee structures.\n\n- **WINR:** The implementation details were insufficient, leading to concerns over the alignment of risk and reward.\n\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit -- Further Clarification on Shortlisted Rationale\n\n**Stablecoin Strategies:**\nProviders like Karpatkey, Avantgarde/MYSO, and Gauntlet stood out due to their provided backtests, clear execution plans, compensation structure, and risk management frameworks.\n\nWe have high confidence in their ability to execute the conversion of 15M ARB into stablecoins with minimal slippage and market impact.\n\nAs well as deploy these assets in well-established, low-risk protocols—aligned with the intended use of funds. The shortlisted proposals target an average yield of 8% to 12% under varying market conditions while primarily holding USDC and USDT.\n\nThis is why we’re recommending a **YES** vote on the stablecoin allocation.\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit V2 \n**Below is a summary of the strategies, including fees and expected returns. Please refer to the tables for full details and note the associated risks outlined below.**\n\nNote that strategies might share the same general risks, and differences in returns may come down to how effectively the providers optimize yield under varying market conditions.\n\nThere are no guarantees or risk-sharing by the providers. As described below, fees are based on the allocation of assets to each provider and/or their performance.\n\nNote that for the Arbitrum Strategy, while both applicants use Myso they have wildly different reported return profiles (hence different risk profiles).\n\n---\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy**\n\n|Stablecoin Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Gauntlet | AAVE V3 | 8% | Free|\n|Karpatkey | Uniswap v3, Camelot v3, Balancer v2/v3, GMX, Aave v3, Compound v3, Fluid, Vertex (Perps), Pendle (Yield) | 12-20% | 0.5% management|\n|AvantGarde/MYSO | AAVE V3, Compound (core),  Pendle, Fluid, and Uni v3 (satellite) | 5-15% | 0.5% / 10% management/performance|\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Strategy**\n\n|Arbitrum Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Karpatkey | Myso | 7-20% | 0.5% mgnt|\n|Avantgarde/MYSO | Myso | 30%+ | 15% perf|\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Key Risks\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\n* **Stablecoin Risk:** The possibility of a stablecoin depegging.\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Exposure to potential hacks of the protocols used by each provider.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Funds may become locked if the lending rate reaches 100%.\n* **Optimization Risk:** The provider’s optimization might not perform as intended or may fail to beat the benchmark.\n* **Custody Risk:** Since the Foundation remains the custodian, custody risk is effectively transferred to the Foundation.\n\n### Arbitrum Strategy\n\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Inherent risk of the protocol being compromised.\n* **Asset Risk:** ARB could lose all value.\n* **Counterparty Risk:** If no counterparty is found, the strategy’s yield could drop to 0%.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Liquidity is locked for the duration of the call (30 days for monthly, 7 days for weekly).\n* **Covered Call Risks:**\n  * **Potential Conversion Risk:** If the strike price is reached, the ARB allocation may convert into stablecoins (see “Managing Potential Conversions”).\n  * **Premium Fluctuations:** Option premiums vary based on ARB’s volatility.\n  * **Secondary Market Risk:** If a covered call isn’t held to expiry, exposure to secondary market prices may result as the matched trading firm buys back the call.\n\n\n---\n\n**ARB Strategies:**\nWhen it comes to the ARB proposals, our review was less encouraging. Although there are some promising elements—for instance, Karpatkey and Avantgarde/MYSO show potential—the ARB strategies did not meet our strict criteria for transparency and risk mitigation. Our internal grading highlighted significant concerns:\n\n* **Lack of Transparency:** Key operational details—such as ARB option liquidity, allocation splits, and execution mechanisms—were either insufficiently detailed or not publicly verifiable, particularly for strategies involving off-chain fund movements.\n* **Inadequate Risk Management:** Given recent security breaches and governance failures across the industry, we believe that preserving the DAO’s capital is a priority. Without a clear risk framework, moving forward with these strategies would introduce unnecessary exposure.\n* **Trade-Offs vs. Returns:** The proposed strategies projected yields between 7% and 30%, depending on the strike price and maturity of options sold, and if the options are sold. If no counterparty is found the options strategy would yield a 0% return. Lending-based strategies offered minimal returns, around 0.16% per year which, even at our maximum allocation, would generate only $10,000–$12,000 annually at current prices. Given the scale of the allocation ($7.5M), these returns do not justify the associated risks.\n\nGiven these trade-offs, we believe the risk is not justified for an allocation of $7.5M worth of assets. Until proposals can deliver fully detailed strategies that meet our risk-adjusted return standards, it’s prudent to vote **NO** for the ARB allocation.\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Alignment Consideration:**\nA key criterion for evaluating submissions was alignment with Arbitrum. While most strategies will be executed on the Arbitrum network, not all will involve Arbitrum native protocols.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this but the main ones are the absence of proposals by Arbitrum native protocols and the fact that most liquidity on Arbitrum is on non-native protocols, making it difficult to allocate a large amount of stablecoin while retaining a competitive yield.\n\nGiven the dearth of sufficient proposals, our recommendation is to do nothing rather than something not justifiable from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n---\n# Edit 06.03.2025 V3\nFurther Clarification on the Shortlisted Rationale\n\n# TMC Clarification on ARB Strategy Decision\n\nHello everyone,\n\nFirst, we want to sincerely thank the teams at @avantgarde, @karpatkey, and Myso for taking the time to discuss their proposals in greater detail with us. We appreciate your proactive approach and the thoughtful contributions you have made, both privately and in the forum.\n\nBelow, we provide additional context on our recommendation to defer active deployment of the ARB allocation at this time, along with feedback on each proposal’s approach and risk management.\n\n# Overall Rationale for the “Hold ARB” Recommendation\n\n### Risk and Transparency\n\nWhile both teams have made significant efforts, the operational details for the ARB strategies, such as liquidity for options, counterparty arrangements, and daily/weekly execution, remain unclear. Given the large ARB allocation, this uncertainty makes us cautious.\n\n### Yield versus Complexity\n\nThe proposed yields for ARB strategies vary widely, ranging from near zero (for example, simple lending) to around 30% (for example, covered calls). However, the higher-yield strategies depend on liquidity or counterparties that may not be scalable, and the lower-yield approaches (for example, 0.16% on Aave) do not justify the additional complexity and risk.\n\n### Asset Manager Selection Considerations\n\nIt’s important to note that selecting an asset manager for alpha generation typically requires a multi-year to decade-long track record across multiple market regimes, a challenging standard, even in traditional finance. Therefore, if the core ARB strategy cannot stand on its own merits, claims of expertise should not serve as the primary selection criteria.\n\n### Prudent Governance\n\nOur mandate is to protect the DAO's treasury. Rather than forcing a strategy with an uncertain risk and reward profile, we prefer to hold ARB until more robust proposals/strategies emerge. This is a postponement rather than a permanent refusal, and we remain open to future improvements.\n\n# Feedback on Karpatkey’s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nWe appreciate Karpatkey’s detailed Risk Management Plan, which includes non-custodial architecture (Safe + Zodiac Roles Modifier), protocol whitelisting (Aave, Compound, Dolomite, Fluid, etc.), and clear maximum exposure thresholds (e.g., no more than 20–25% per protocol).\n\nThe yield estimates of ~8–12% for stablecoins appear realistic, and Karpatkey’s track record in managing other DAO treasuries (Gnosis, ENS, etc.) is well-documented.\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nKarpatkey proposes covered calls (via Myso) and deposit/borrow loops. While these ideas are valid in principle, the TMC remains concerned about the practical scalability of the options component (liquidity, strike selection, and counterparty discovery at large ARB notional sizes).\n\nThe lending-based approach offers minimal yield (~0.16% to ~4%), which does not justify the operational overhead or the added smart contract risk compared to simply holding ARB in a wallet. The covered-call approach is also sensitive to ARB price and carries risk in case of price appreciation as the cost of reimbursing the loan could exceed the value of the stablecoins used for farming. The backtest is based on a period of constant ARB price depreciation and therefore may not fully reflect this risk.\n\nAlthough Karpatkey mentions having advanced monitoring systems to respond promptly to adverse market conditions, we lack sufficient visibility into these tools to confidently recommend this approach to the DAO.\n\n# Feedback on Avantgarde’s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nThe Risk Management section shared by Avantgarde (and MYSO) highlights position-sizing constraints, lockup safeguards, and a diversified stablecoin approach. We especially appreciate the plan’s clarity on monitoring liquidity needs and the ability for the DAO to recall funds if necessary.\n\nExpected returns of 5–15% are in line with typical DeFi yields, and the approach includes established protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap.\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nSimilar to Karpatkey, Avantgarde’s ARB strategy also leans heavily on covered calls (via Myso) for yield generation. Although the theoretical upside is attractive, we lack sufficient real-world liquidity data for large ARB notional amounts. In addition to the conversion risk, the strategy presents a risk in case of a sharp ARB price increase (which again may not be accurately accounted for in backtests done over a period of relatively constant price depreciation). For instance, vaults on Ribbon and Premia also rely on selling covered calls and have recently incurred losses despite both vaults having widely different strategies, following sharp increases in the price of the underlying assets:\n\n![|279x242](upload://s9o3LomjufpoKGFCv2vNkXsIZ7e.png)![|278x242](upload://muAKCFJgbv5cgXo77WVyzhgL7CL.png)\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-ETH-C\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-WBTC-C\n\n![|624x237](upload://sZsXqwOlNY5GCyQH9FPHflXdoVZ.png)\n\nhttps://app.premia.blue/vaults/0xdc631d88dbb5eb39f5c4bf8b4e5298d098912fff\n\nWe value the team’s willingness to iterate on strike selection and maturity dates, but given current market conditions, we do not see a clear, low-risk path to consistent yields above simple “hold” alternatives.\n\n---\n\n# Reminder of Grading Criteria\nOur evaluation of proposals was based on the following key factors:\n- **25% – Experience & Track Record:** Demonstrated ability to manage treasury assets securely and effectively.\n- **25% – Risk Management:** Strength and clarity of risk mitigation measures under diverse market conditions.\n- **15% – Alignment with DAO Goals:** Consistency with the DAO’s growth objectives and ecosystem utility enhancement.\n- **15% – Expected Returns:** Realistic yield projections and sound risk-adjusted performance metrics.\n- **20% – Transparency & Reporting:** Commitment to regular, clear reporting and continuous performance monitoring.\n\n----\n\n# Timelines & Next Steps\n\nWe will move forward with a vote on Snapshot next Thursday, March 6, 2025.\n\n\n**Phase 1 – ARB Conversion & Stablecoin Management (15M ARB)**\n\n**IF Stable Strategy is Deployed*\n- Initiate a three‑month phase to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins.\n- Proceed with the deployment of low‑risk, yield‑bearing strategies for the converted stablecoins, with regular performance and risk reporting.\n\n**IF Stable Strategy is not Deployed:**\nRetain the current ARB holdings without conversion.\nNo further actions will be taken regarding stablecoin management until a new decision is reached.\n\n**Phase 2 – ARB On-Chain Strategy Deployment (10M ARB)**\n\n**IF ARB Strategy is Deployed:**\n- Deploy the 10M ARB into on-chain strategies.\n- Despite going against the TMC recommendation, we will commit to establishing a set of safe parameters for running the strategy.\n\n**IF ARB Strategy is not Deployed:**\n- Hold the ARB tokens without deploying them into on-chain strategies.\n- 3 months post Snapshot the RFP process will be held again.\n\n**Additional Next Steps for Both Allocations**\nThree months after the managers have been elected, publish a comprehensive report detailing the performance and management outcomes and re-evaluate the allocation strategy for potential adjustments.",

        "body": "# TL;DR\nThe GMC's preferred choices for the deployment of 7,500 Arbitrum DAO treasury ETH are stated below. The selected protocols include Camelot, Aave, Lido, and Fluid. If this vote receives 3% of the votable token supply in favor (or abstain) of deploying assets in accordance to the GMC's choices, the Arbitrum Foundation will begin to mobilize. \n\n# Summary [Updated on March 14, 2025]\nOn December 21 2024, the Arbitrum DAO voted in favour of establishing two committees - the Treasury Management Committee (TMC) and the Growth Management Committee (GMC), who were tasked with spearheading treasury management efforts involving 25M ARB and 7,500 ETH, respectively, within the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury.\n\nThis proposal presents GMC’s preferred allocation choices with accompanying risk assessments performed by LlamaRisk. After assessing all 45 applications, the GMC is proposing to allocate 5,000 ETH to Lido to be staked for wstETH, and deposit this 5,000 wstETH into Aave V3 on Arbitrum to act as liquidity for LST/LRT looping, and lastly, lend 2,500 ETH on Fluid to support ETH based DEX and lending liquidity.\n\n# Objectives\nAs highlighted in the original Treasury Management V1.2 proposal, the purpose of the Growth Management Committee (GMC) was to provide a path for the Arbitrum Foundation to deploy 7,500 ETH from the DAO’s treasury to achieve 2 things:\n\nGenerate low-risk yield on otherwise idle ETH\nSpur ecosystem growth\nMoreover, given this is the DAO’s first tranche of funds, we really wanted to ensure the DAO starts with a really strong and stable foundation, while securing key partnerships from the very beginning. Thus, we focused on selecting extremely high quality partners with low risk strategies that allowed the DAO’s funds to maximize its reach and impact within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# GMC’s Preferred Allocations\nTotal Allocation: 7,500 ETH\n\nNumber of Allocations: 4\n\n# Allocation 1:\n\nProtocol: Lido\n\nAllocation Amount: 5,000 ETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Deposit and stake 5,000 ETH with Lido to receive wstETH\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n3.20% ETH/stETH yield (30D Avg.)\nHighly liquid & composable receipt token that can be extended across other applications (wstETH)\n20% “Reward Share” from Lido’s Reward-Share Program, effectively giving the DAO a higher yield on our ETH deposits into Lido\n# Allocation 2:\n\nProtocol: Aave\n\nAllocation Amount: 4,200 stETH (in wstETH) [Previously 5,000 ETH]\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Supply 4,200 stETH (in wstETH) to Aave V3 on Arbitrum to encourage LRT borrowing against wstETH in collaboration with Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n3.20% ETH/stETH yield (30D Avg.) + est. Aave wstETH supply yield of 0.62% + 0.82% in wstETH deposit incentives\nAdditional incentive programs from Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp, to drive wstETH, ezETH, and rsETH deposits to Aave V3 and more generally Arbitrum. This should also hopefully increase supply rates for wstETH on Aave\nAllows the DAO to repurpose funds from Allocation 1 (wstETH) to further improve the DeFi ecosystem while accessing a higher yield\nFurther Details Regarding Incentives:\n\nIn cooperation with Lido, an incentive program to grow wstETH deposits on the Aave Arbitrum instance has been designed.\n\nThe incentive program consists of three 30-day phases, each with increasing targets and budgets to encourage sustained growth in wstETH deposits on Aave. After 90 days this program will be reassessed and may be renewed. For each phase, the reward mechanism operates in two modes:\n\nWhen deposits are below the target: Depositors earn a fixed 0.82% APY.\nWhen deposits exceed the target: The daily reward amount is distributed pro-rata among all depositors.\nThe program features a 15% Month-over-Month growth target with an expanding budget to support continued growth in wstETH deposits on the Arbitrum Aave instance.\n\nPeriod (Days)\tBudget (wstETH)\tFixed APY\tDeposit Target\tDaily Reward\n0-30\t36.23\t0.82%\t53,014.48\t1.191\n31-60\t41.66\t0.82%\t60,956.66\t1.389\n61-90\t47.91\t0.82%\t70,111.66\t1.597\nRenzo\n\nRenzo is to provide 0.30% yield in REZ to users who deposit ezETH distributed every 30 days , provided certain conditions are upheld.\n\nKelp\n\nKelp is to provide x2 KERNEL points to users who deposit rsETH. These rewards will be claimable during Kernel’s TGE. Whilst the point yield is speculative, it does provide an alternative to Renzo’s governance token derived yield.\n\nIncentives\n\nThis strategy benefits directly from the Lido wstETH deposit incentives, and will indirectly benefit from the Renzo and Kelp deposit incentives.\n\nReward Type\tValue\tRewards to who\tBenefits treasury funds?\nwstETH Deposit Rewards\t0.82% APY\twstETH depositors\tDirectly\nKERNEL Points\tx2 Points\trsETH depositors\tIndirectly\nREZ Tokens\t0.3% APY\tezETH despositors\tIndirectly\nExpected Returns\n\nBased upon our modelling of the effects of the upcoming incentive programs and some minor Aave parameter adjustments which are planned, we expect wstETH deposits to generate the following returns:\n\nSource\tYield (APY)\nLido staking rewards\t3.10%\nAave protocol yield\t0.62%\nwstETH deposit incentives\t0.82%\nTotal yield\t4.54%\n# Allocation 3:\n\nProtocol: Fluid\n\nAllocation Amount: 2,500 ETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Lend 2,500 ETH on Fluid’s Arbitrum platform\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n1%-2% native ETH yield\nSupport the growth of Fluid’s highly capital efficient DEX and lending protocol by providing ‘sticky’ ETH liquidity for users to borrow\nDue to Fluid’s design, every $1 of ETH we lend, the Arbitrum ecosystem can benefit from up to $39 in liquidity\nProvide necessary liquidity to increase caps and onboard more LSTs and LRTs to Fluid’s Arbitrum instance\n# [Added as of March 14, 2025] Allocation 4:\n\nProtocol: Camelot - Updated submission can be found here\n\nAllocation Amount: 800 stETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Deposit 800 stETH (as wstETH) as single sided liquidity into the wstETH/ETH liquidity pool on Camelot V3.\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\nEarn 2.56% APY from wstETH yield, trading fees, & xGRAIL (30D Avg.)\nAllows the DAO to repurpose funds from Allocation 1 (wstETH) to further improve sticky DeFi liquidity\nA risk Assessment (LlamaRisk) finds that risks include liquidity concentration risk and smart contract risk.\n\nNote: The decision to provide single-sided wstETH liquidity came from discussions with and detailed analysis by the Camelot team, as they are aware of the difficulties associated with the DAO and the Arbitrum Foundation actively managing a concentrated LP position. Nonetheless, the strategy still successfully improves wstETH liquidity on Camelot and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\n# Justification\nThe GMC was impressed by the quality of inbound applications from protocols across many different verticals (full list can be in a subsequent section of this post). While the GMC wanted to venture further down the risk curve in order to increase yield, help bootstrap up and coming protocols, bolster Arbitrum native/aligned protocols, among other desires, it determined that a strong/conservative foundation for the DAO’s treasury strategy made the most sense until the DAO becomes more capable of actively managing positions.\n\nFor example, many proposals included LRT-based strategies. While the GMC did want to encourage the growth of LRTs, we did not think the direct exposure to LRTs was appropriate for the first tranche of fund deployments. Instead, we chose a sector that indirectly benefits LRTs by deepening wstETH liquidity to enable LRT looping strategies. In a different example to help explain the rationale behind our preferred choices, many applications included vote-locked/escrowed tokens as a portion of the yield, but it’s difficult to envision how these reward tokens would be managed in practice. A large number of applicants requested the DAO take on leveraged positions, which would require active management to manage liquidation risk. We also received applications from centralized entities, but felt the allocation would be most beneficial for the Arbitrum ecosystem if given to protocol applications that indirectly benefit a variety of other protocols on Arbitrum.\n\nLido, Aave, and Fluid represent safe applications that achieve conservative yield and strongly support ecosystem growth. Lido has offered a strong concession in its 20% reward share to the DAO, and has proven to be an essential protocol across a number of DeFi ecosystems. Many protocols on Arbitrum would benefit from a larger supply of wstETH on the network, and by partnering with Lido, we are able to achieve this and form a long-term relationship with a protocol that has made critical contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem. Aave falls in this camp as well, it is a well-established and battle-tested player that is easy to form a treasury management strategy around, and it has exemplified product market fit across a wide variety of DeFi ecosystems. In terms of Fluid, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi protocols, with its marketshare continually trending upwards on Ethereum mainnet thanks to its capital efficient design. Fluid is already seeing strong growth on Arbitrum One, has committed to incentivizing its Arbitrum One deployment, and the GMC believes that this growth can be fueled forward by including them in the DAO’s treasury management program. Fluid’s highest-in-class LTVs will result in maximum ecosystem value add for those users wishing to take advantage of these unique opportunities too.\n\nWe want to remind all applicants that this is hopefully the first round of many future allocations. The desire is to continually reinvest ETH and stablecoin revenue into the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem to increase DAO sustainability as well as supporting Arbitrum’s ecosystem of builders. If you were not selected this round, you will be considered in future allocations assuming the DAO supports it.\n\n# Risk Assessment (Llama Risk)\nLlamaRisk has reviewed these different strategies and finds the risk inherent to each is satisfactorily mitigated to warrant the allocation. In summary, LlamaRisk have identified the following key asset risks and strategy risks:\n\nIncremental wstETH asset risks include:\n\nLiquidity for the asset is low on Arbitrum, meaning the ETH allocation will have to be staked on mainnet then bridged over using Arbitrum’s canonical bridge.\nIncremental Aave wstETH strategy risks include:\n\nArbitrum DAO may not be able to withdraw its entire position at all times due to volatility reducing market liquidity. This risk is managed by Aave’s interest rate model, with successful effects demonstrated with the level of withdrawal liquidity of Aave V3’s Arbitrum wstETH market being over 40,000 on February 4th.\nThe yield may be lower than anticipated as liquid restaking yield is lower than was expected 6 months ago, meaning limited profit for traders leveraged longing liquid restaking tokens and shorting liquid staking tokens. This is the primary use case for those looking to short wstETH, which is demonstrated by low deposit rates for wstETH on this market.\nFluid strategy risks include:\n\nFluid DAO change management processes (e.g. LTV modifications) are not clearly structured and outlined. This could lead to changes to market critical settings going into effect without all participants knowing, which may have unintended consequences.\nA high degree of trust is placed in the core team, with access controls resting in their hands over important functions such as freezing the protocol, users and market modifications. A 7/13 multisig controls these functions, which is owned by the core team. Given that many of these signers are based in India, some degree of operational risk is introduced from frequently arbitrary regulatory rulings in this jurisdiction potentially preventing their continued compliance with the protocol’s best interest. Uncertainty remains, introducing risk.\nAs with Aave, pool liquidity risk may prevent the DAO’s entire position being withdrawn in a single transaction during periods of high volatility. Also as with Aave, Fluid competently restores market liquidity quickly through its interest rate model.\nFull risk analyses, with guiding processes, are available:\n\nwstETH asset + Aave Strategy Risk Analysis\nETH asset + Fluid Risk Analysis\n# Next Steps\nIf approved by the DAO, which per the original proposal that passed on Tally requires a Snapshot vote with a simple majority of votes signaling For/Abstain with the quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply at the time of the proposal going live, the Arbitrum Foundation can begin deploying the 7,500 ETH in accordance with the processes defined in the original applications. This proposal will move to Snapshot on Thursday, March 20, 2025.\n\nIf the DAO rejects the choice of the GMC, it will take into account the feedback from the community and alter its choices and proceed to another forum post/Snapshot vote over the coming weeks.\n\n# Full list of applications\nThe entire list of submitted applications can be found here.

Please refer to the forums for the full proposal. https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-treasury-management-v1-2/26967\n\nATTENTION: AFTER ~1 MONTH OF COMMUNITY FEEDBACK AND COMMITTEE MEMBER VETTING, THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN RENAMED FROM V1.1 TO V1.2 AFTER BEING UPDATED. PLEASE REVIEW THOROUGHLY AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2024.\n\n## Abstract\n\nOn September 12th, Entropy hosted a preliminary treasury working group call (recordings available [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/6?u=entropy)) in an effort to align all of the different parties within the DAO on the optimal path forward when it comes to managing the different sections of the DAO’s balance sheet. I.e., chain profits (ETH) and tokens that have been authorized for spend but have not entered circulation yet (ARB). The primary points of contention were around ARB diversification, the need for a DAO budget before the conversation on treasury management continues forward, whether the DAO needs active treasury managers at all, infrastructure selection, and details around a treasury committee’s implementation, e.g., how many individuals/entities, are they DAO-elected or appointed, when should we target to have this committee stood up, etc. From our perspective, we did gain consensus that the DAO’s profits (ETH) in the treasury should be turned productive and that a treasury management committee of some sort should be established. However, even on these two points that most people seem to be in favor of, specific details need to be ironed out for actionable strategies to be implemented.\n\nWe believe that we have come up with a fair compromise between all of the various perspectives on these identified issues, all of which stem from the information gathered during the working group calls and conversations with delegates. The compromise suggested herein will, in our opinion, enable the DAO to move forward and initiate the required operational standards for optimizing the use of idle tokens in the treasury. Based on the feedback received on the call on September 25th (link to recording [here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/treasury-management-working-group-call/26723/7?u=swmartin)) where we presented the overarching ideas herein, we feel confident that this proposal aligns well with the treasury managers, infrastructure providers, and overall DAO sentiment towards treasury management. We are eager to gather more feedback from the community and continue iterating so this initiative can move forward.\n\n## Key Issues Treasury Management can Solve Today\n\n1. Service Provider Shortfalls: DAO-funded programs as well as service providers that have proved valuable to the DAO (the ARDC, Steakhouse’s services as a part of STEP, etc.) have run into the problem of having dollar-denominated contracts and not enough ARB to meet the agreed upon rate for services rendered.\n2. Flexible & Metrics-Driven Capital Deployment: The DAO is reliant on RWAs/Treasuries for passive yield on dollars, but has no mechanism for reallocating to onchain strategies as we enter a global rate cutting regime that could make onchain yields more attractive. The DAO also currently lacks the ability to frictionlessly assess the returns and underlying risks of comparative liquid market investments, how much of/when ARB in the treasury should be diversified, and how to optimize operating cash-like reserves.\n3. Reinvesting Sequencer Revenue: The DAO has neglected to do anything productive with its ETH holdings, which could provide the DAO leverage to fuel growth and partnerships alongside yield—consistent with the DAO’s growth-first mindset.\n\n## The Proposed Solution\n\n### TL;DR\n\n* Establish two token management tracks (Treasury and Growth) with their own 3-seat committees. Treasury Management will focus on passive yield via ARB-only onchain strategies on Arbitrum One and create a cash-like reserve alongside a management strategy to cover service provider shortfalls. Growth Management will focus on strategic partnerships by exclusively reinvesting the DAO’s ETH holdings into “ETH-backed strategies”.

Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after.

        "body": "Abstract:\nThis Arbitrum Improvement Proposal (AIP) is presented with the vision of further enhancing the Arbitrum ecosystem following the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP). Acknowledging the STIP’s instrumental role in the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem, this proposal seeks to extend its positive impact by introducing a gas rebate and trading incentive program created by Rage Trade, a native perp aggregator on Arbitrum. Through this initiative, we aspire to not only complement the milestones achieved by the STIP but also to significantly increase the influx of new traders into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMotivation:\nAs the Short Term Incentive Program (STIP) kicks off, it sets the stage for the Arbitrum ecosystem to experience amplified growth. The STIP is poised to play a pivotal role in promoting on-chain activities and reinforcing key protocols. However, there is plenty of opportunity to intensify user engagement and participation, especially when considering innovative platforms like Rage Trade.\n\nThis proposal is driven by the ambition to harness this potential, acting synergistically with the anticipated successes of the STIP. Through Rage Trade’s introduction of a gas rebate and trading incentive program, our objective is not just to elevate trading activity, but also to enhance the overall user experience, attracting and onboarding new traders to the ecosystem. This effort is geared towards empowering platforms that, in line with Arbitrum’s vision, are poised for growth but require additional support to maximize their contribution.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis proposal aligns with Arbitrum’s mission to foster a dynamic and engaged community. By allocating 100% of the grant funds to create a gas rebate and trading incentives program, Rage Trade’s platform aims to refine the user experience of traders while offering gas savings and trading incentives to stimulate a competitive yet cooperative environment.\n\nSpecifications: A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.\nRage Trade Platform:\n\nAs a prime broker and perpetual aggregator, Rage Trade unifies top decentralized perpetual exchanges across all EVM-compatible chains. It streamlines the trading experience by eliminating complexities associated with collateral and gas fund management, ensuring a faster, more efficient, and user-friendly environment for traders.\n\nGas Tank Mechanism:\n\nThe Gas Tank is a unique feature of Rage Trade that simplifies trading across different chains. Users deposit funds into their account, and a portion goes into the Gas Tank. This fund is then used to cover gas fees across various chains, eliminating the need for users to manage gas fees separately.\n\nSession-Based Trading System:\n\nRage Trade employs a session-based trading system where users create a session that lasts for a specified duration (e.g., 7 days). This system reduces the need for manual transaction signing, making the trading experience smoother and more akin to centralized exchanges.\n\nMulti-Leg Trading and Auto-Populating Bridge:\n\nThe platform allows users to create multiple trades from different chains and perps on Arbitrum, enabling them to spread risk and optimize execution. Additionally, Rage Trade handles all the bridging details, automatically selecting the best bridge or swap routes for seamless trade execution.\n\nCustom Route Selection:\n\nUsers have the option to split their orders based on various criteria such as best execution price, lowest funding fees, or routes with bonuses like emissions or airdrops. This feature provides flexibility and optimization for trade execution.\n\nAggregated Referral & Competitions:\n\nRage Trade aggregates referrals and competitions across different perp protocols, allowing users to participate in various trading competitions and referral programs through a single platform.\n\nIncentive Distribution:\n\nThe proposal involves the distribution of 1.5 million ARB tokens to incentivize trading volume on Rage Trade. The distribution will be structured to reward active traders and participants in trading competitions, fostering increased engagement and liquidity on the platform.\n\nTrading Competitions:\n\nA series of trading competitions will be organized, with ARB tokens allocated as prizes. These competitions aim to attract traders, boost trading volume, and create a vibrant trading community on Rage Trade.\n\nUser Engagement and Performance Metrics:\nRage Trade has successfully cultivated a dynamic user base, boasting 70,000 active traders who regularly engage with our platform. This robust participation is a testament to our platform’s appeal and functionality within the trading community.\n\nIn addition to our active traders, we have nurtured a strong Liquidity Provider (LP) community, with 26,000 LPs contributing to our ecosystem. This substantial number of LPs underscores our platform’s reliability and the trust placed in us by those who provide liquidity, further cementing our role as a pivotal player in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our protocol’s historical performance not only demonstrates significant growth and adoption but also highlights our consistent delivery of value to our users, traders, and liquidity providers. These metrics are indicative of our integral position within the Arbitrum ecosystem and our potential to further enhance and expand our offerings with sustained support.\n\nRage’s Perpetual Performance:\n\nRage Trade v1 has experienced a remarkable market reception, evidenced by a staggering $735M in Total Trading Volume against Rage’s Total Value Locked (TVL). This impressive figure reflects the high demand and active engagement within our user base, showcasing the platform’s appeal and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n962×642 21.9 KB\nRage’s Vaults Performance:\n\nOur vault offerings, including the 80-20 Tricrypto Vault and GLP Vault, have achieved a notable peak TVL of approximately $19.87 million (at 100% max capacity since launch). This achievement highlights the trust and confidence users place in our vault products.\n\nAt its peak, Rage Trade accounted for about 1.4% of the entire Arbitrum TVL, marking our significant contribution to the overall ecosystem. This percentage represents our substantial impact and the value we add to the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThe 80-20 Tricrypto vault, in particular, has demonstrated exceptional performance. Over its 10-month lifespan, it outperformed holding GLP by 8%. Specifically, from July 2022 to April 2023, the 80-20 Tricrypto vault yielded a 44% return compared to a 36% return from merely holding GLP, showcasing its effectiveness and profitability.\n\nSteps to Implement: The steps to implement the AIP, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, any AIPs involving transactions with third parties (such as grants) will need to ensure that applicable legal documentation and procedures are also included.\nTo implement this proposal, we will follow a structured approach, ensuring each phase contributes effectively to the overall goal. Here’s how we plan to proceed:\n\nData Reporting and Transparency: Rage Trade is committed to transparency and will implement Dune dashboards for real-time tracking of all relevant metrics. These dashboards will ensure community members have access to up-to-date data, reflecting our progress and adherence to the commitments outlined in this proposal. This approach emphasizes our dedication to transparency and accountability within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIncentive Allocation: We will begin by using a portion of the ARB tokens for our gas rebate program to offset gas fees for our users. This will serve as the initial spark to ignite trading activities on the Rage Trade platform.\n\nFee Offset & Trading Competitions: We will then allocate the remaining tokens to incentivize trading, including trade competitions and offsetting fees implemented by integrated perp protocols. The trading competitions will be strategically scheduled over time to ensure ongoing participation and interest.\n\nRegular Updates and Reporting: Throughout the implementation, we will continuously monitor platform performance, trader engagement, and community feedback. This will allow us to make real-time adjustments and improvements where necessary. To maintain transparency, we will provide the community with regular updates and reports. These will include key performance metrics and insights gained from the implementation process.\n\nReview and Analysis: At the end of the implementation phase, we will conduct a thorough review. This will involve analyzing successes, identifying areas for improvement, and extracting key learnings for future initiatives.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to ensure not just the successful implementation of the proposal but also to contribute valuable insights for the continuous growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nTimeline: Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\nThe implementation of this proposal is structured into a 4-month period, with each month focusing on specific objectives and milestones:\n\nMonth 1 - Initiation and Setup (Immediately upon approval):\n\nAllocation of ARB tokens to the designated multisig wallet to immediately initiate gas rebates and trading fee offsets. Setup of the Dune dashboard for tracking key metrics such as trading volume and unique traders. Announcement of the initiative and upcoming trading competitions to the community.\n\nMonth 2 - Launch of Trading Competitions:\n\nOfficial launch of the first set of trading competitions.\n\nActive monitoring of trading activities and engagement levels.\n\nFirst monthly update provided to the community, highlighting early results and trader participation.\n\nMonth 3 - Mid-term Review and Adjustments:\n\nComprehensive review of the first two months, analyzing trader engagement and competition outcomes.\n\nAdjustments made to competitions and incentives based on feedback and data analysis.\n\nSecond monthly update provided, including insights and any changes implemented.\n\nMonth 4 - Final Push and Comprehensive Analysis:\n\nContinued incentivization and promotion of trading activities.\n\nFinal monthly update provided, leading up to the comprehensive quarterly report.\n\nPreparation of the detailed analysis report, evaluating the proposal’s success based on predefined objectives.\n\nPost-4-Month Period - Evaluation and Reporting:\n\nRelease of a comprehensive quarterly report, detailing the overall impact of the proposal on trading volume, trader engagement, and growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Evaluation of the initiative’s success and consideration of potential future actions based on the outcomes.\n\nThis timeline ensures a structured approach to implementing the proposal, with regular updates and transparency. It allows for adjustments based on real-time data and community feedback, ensuring the initiative remains aligned with its goal of driving growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nTo measure the success of achieving the grant objectives, we will focus on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):\n\nDaily Volume: Aiming for a 30-day moving average of $10M in daily volume.\nDaily Traders: Targeting a 30-day moving average of 300 unique traders.\nIntegration: Committing to integrate 1 or more perpetual DEXes per 2 weeks (accounting for audit time).\nThese KPIs will serve as benchmarks to gauge our progress and effectiveness in utilizing the grant to drive growth and engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nGrant Breakdown:\nRage Trade aims to leverage the grant to attract a substantial influx of users to the Arbitrum ecosystem, bolstering user interaction, transaction volume, TVL, and overall activity.\n\nStrategically, Rage Trade will allocate ~ 33% of the grant to gas rebates, with the other ~ 66% of the grant being directed towards offsetting integrated perp protocols’ trading fees and various trading competitions. The endgame is to amplify user onboarding and trading enthusiasm, resonating with genuine market dynamics.\n\nIt’s crucial to clarify that rebate rates will be determined by the genuine fees incurred by users. If our partnering protocols grant separate rebates or rewards, Rage Trade commits to ensuring that the total sum of rebates will never surpass the fees accrued. Throughout this promotional phase, trade-to-earn schemes will not be entertained. Additionally, the Rage Trade team will vigilantly deter and counteract wash trading and Sybil-attack incidents. Offending addresses linked with such activities will be publicly disclosed and denied the associated rebates.\n\nGas Rebates Explained:\nOnce a week, traders will receive ARB tokens as a gas rebate, mirroring the gas fees they’ve incurred throughout the week. This rebate system ensures that users can trade more freely, knowing a portion of their gas fees will be returned. The gas rebate will be uniformly applied across all protocols integrated with Rage Trade on Arbitrum, ensuring fairness and consistency for all traders. The rebate amount a trader receives will be directly proportional to the actual gas fees they’ve paid, eliminating any potential for manipulative practices like trade-to-earn schemes.\n\nFee Rebates Explained:\n\nARB tokens will be rewarded as fee rebates to our traders every Friday, reflecting the fees they’ve accumulated over the week.\n\nThis fee waiver will be consistently applied across all collaborating protocols.\n\nTraders’ rebate entitlements will strictly correlate with their actual trading fees, nullifying the chance for trade-to-earn practices. The rate of expenditure from the grant will be contingent on the volume of organic trading transpiring each week. The Rage Trade team pledges to continually identify and thwart wash trading and sybil-attack attempts.\n\nTo safeguard the integrity of the campaign, the specifics of the anti-wash-trading & anti-sybil-attack measures will be kept confidential and will be communicated post-event, mirroring best practices employed in protocol airdrop launches.\n\nExample of Fee Structure Post-Reduction:\n\nIf additional perps trading mechanisms in the Arbitrum realm are incorporated with Rage Trade amidst this campaign, the fee waiver will extend to those as well.\n\nIntegrated protocol trading fee rates before and after reduction\n\nGMX V1: 0.1% → 0%\n\nGMX V2: 0.05% / 0.07% → 0%\n\nOverall Cost: The total cost to implement the AIP.\nThe total cost to implement this AIP for Rage Trade is 1.5M ARB tokens. This cost is solely dedicated to funding trading competitions and volume incentives on the Rage Trade platform. The breakdown is as follows:\n\nGas Rebates: 500k ARB tokens will be allocated for offsetting gas fees when trading perps on Arbitrum.\n\nTrading Fee Rebates & Competitions: The remaining 1m ARB will be used as trading fee offsets and trading competitions.\n\nThere are no additional costs involved in this proposal. The entire 1.5M ARB token request is focused on directly incentivizing users and enhancing their trading experience on Rage Trade.",
