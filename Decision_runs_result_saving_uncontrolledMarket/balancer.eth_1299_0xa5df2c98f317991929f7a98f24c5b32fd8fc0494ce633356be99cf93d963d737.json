Our synths, baoUSD and baoETH, are backed by debt positions created in our vaults, and stable assets via its PSM.\n>\n>\n>\n> BaoETH is minted by whitelisted contracts, which currently are “the fed” and “the ballast”. The Bao multisig has control over which contracts are whitelisted. Changes are approved via governance.\n>\n>\n>\n> The fed mints baoETH into our vaults, ready to be borrowed against highly liquid collaterals. Controlling the borrowable supply also affects the variable loan interest rate, helping maintain the peg.\n>\n>\n>\n> The baoETH ballast mints baoETH when supplied with ETH at a 1:1 ratio. While there is ETH available, baoETH can be burned to claim ETH at a 1:1 ratio. The baoETH“mint limit” is controlled by the BAO multisig.\n>\n>\n>\n> Bao also issues basket tokens, representing an index of underlying tokens with the option to a yield strategy. These underlying assets are not tradeable with each other, so don’t suffer from the same risk vectors as an LP position, where a single asset could destroy the value of the entire position, or pool balances can be manipulated into an exploitable state. Each basket token represents the holders’ share of underlying assets. It can be minted with a supply asset (ETH, DAI), which is traded for the underlying assets and deposited into their yield strategy. Underlying assets can be redeemed at any time by basket token holders. The composition of each basket is managed via governance. Our current baskets are bSTBL (yield bearing USD basket) and bETH (a basket of LSD tokens)\n>\n>\n>\n> bSTBL and bETH are designed to be ideal collateral for baoETH, focusing on the industry’s lowest risk, most liquid stable-coins and LSDs, and the safest yield strategies. Using bSTBL and bETH as collateral for baoETH allows highly liquid, stable, and yield-bearing collateral whose underlying assets and strategies can be adapted over time with the market, without relying on users to alter their positions. The current composition of bSTBL is 50% DAI and 50% USDC and the composition of bETH is initially 71% wstETH and 29% rETH.\n>\n>\n>\n> Further baskets and synthetics are planned in the future.\n>\n>\n>\n> Currently there is no incentivised liquidity for baoETH although this is expected to change shortly as there is a routine governance proposal on the Bao governance forum activating rewards for several gauges based around the beoETH balancer base pool - baoETH/ETH, BAO/baoETH-ETH and bETH/baoETH-ETH. https://gov.bao.finance/t/bip-36-base-pool-gauges/1229\n\nAdditional details on our expansion and decentralization plans can be found here, in our successful baoUSD gauge proposal: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-270-enable-baousd-lusd-gauge-w-2-cap-ethereum/4673/6?u=chickn\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> We would like Balancer to become an essential marketplace for our synthetics. Integrations outside our liquidity gauges are key to sustainability. Balancer was chosen to create Bao’s USD base pool, baoUSD/LUSD, because it is easy to pair with any other token whether stable or volatile. We would like to continue this relationship with our baoETH base pool. Bao intends to use the flexibility of balancers pools to increase adoption of baoETH by allowing other projects to pair tokens with our base pools and incentivise liquidity with Bao emissions on the Bao Finance platform. If successful, the balancer community will benefit from their growing adoption through trading fees and boosts to liquidity in addition to bribes to vote for the pool. \n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. Governance: Currently baoETH is governed by the BAO community. Actions voted on are carried out by the community “council of guardians” via its 4/7 multi-sig. This multisig/ council of guardians controls various baoETH parameters like it’s mint limit and collaterals. The council of guardians includes at least one member of each permanent Galaxy (sub team), and any guardian can be recalled at any time via public vote. We plan on using governor bravo or similar in the future to improve decentralization.\n\n> 2. Oracles: Chainlink oracles are used to find collateral prices.\n\n> 3. Audits: Bao re-uses battle-tested compound, inverse, and curve code with some changes and is in the process of auditing\n\n> 4. Centralization vectors: The 4/7 multisig controls the supply of baoUSD available in the PSM and lending market. Other parameters under the multisig control are collateral factors, IMF factor (CF factor reduces as loan size increases), liquidation incentive, ability to deposit collateral, price oracle, new collateral additions.\n\n> 5. Market History: baoETH has been closely pegged since its inception and has robust, battle-tested mechanisms to help it stay pegged. It did suffer a similar depeg to USDC recently, primarily due to most of the available liquidity being in pools containing USDC and DAI. Steps are being taken to reduce reliance on USDC.\n\n> 6. Value: baoETH is in its infancy, but balancer has an opportunity to become the primary source of liquidity for it and future synthetics. The Bao protocol gained a lot of exposure during 2021, attracting up to $200m in liquidity with only a vision, and now the community lead project is launching its first products.\n\nPool: [0x1A44E35d5451E0b78621A1B3e7a53DFaA306B1D0](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x1a44e35d5451e0b78621a1b3e7a53dfaa306b1d000000000000000000000051b)\nGauge 2% cap: [0xD449Efa0A587f2cb6BE3AE577Bc167a774525810](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD449Efa0A587f2cb6BE3AE577Bc167a774525810#code)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xD449Efa0A587f2cb6BE3AE577Bc167a774525810` which corresponds to the 2% capped gauge for this pool\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/627\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to enable a Balancer gauge for the crvUSD/sDAI pool on Gnosis Chain a with 2% emission cap.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • https://curve.fi/\n    • https://resources.curve.fi/\n    • https://github.com/curvefi    \n    • Audits: https://classic.curve.fi/audits                                               \n                  https://github.com/curvefi/security-incident-reports/tree/main/audits\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nCurve is a multichain AMM exchange that specializes in low slippage stablecoin swaps and concentrated liquidity provision. Curve distinguishes itself as the primary liquidity hub for some of the most exciting DeFi innovations, including stablecoins, Liquid Staking Tokens, and Real World Assets. More recently, it has launched its own stablecoin, crvUSD, creating new opportunities for DeFi integrations on both mainnet, and crosschain.\n\n**Motivation:**  \n\ncrvUSD is an overcollaterized stablecoin backed by a diverse set of collateral, including sfrxETH, wstETH, WBTC, WETH, and tBTC. The stablecoin was deployed in March 2023 and has reached a market cap of >$100m since inception. Its primary innovations are the LLAMMA AMM which gradually liquidates positions, and a dynamic monetary policy that adjusts interest rates based on market dynamics. Supporting the growth of crvUSD on Balancer will help Balancer become a hub for the adoption of decentralized stablecoins and enable the creation of new DeFi markets as deep crvUSD liquidity becomes available both on Gnosis, and other chains, that Balancer resides on.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:**  https://gov.curve.fi/        \n                                https://dao.curve.fi/\n\n2. **Oracles:** Internal oracles are utilized for v1 and v2 (crypto pools). LLAMMA, a mechanism used in crvUSD's soft liquidations, can utilize Chainlink for additional redundancy.  https://resources.curve.fi/factory-pools/understanding-oracles/#llamma\n\n3. **Audits:** https://classic.curve.fi/audits \n                     https://github.com/curvefi/security-incident-reports/tree/main/audits\nNumerous audits ongoing for new stableswapNG, two coin cryptoNG, and tricryptoNG pools.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Decentralized with veCRV holders voting on proposals, parameter changes etc. UI remains closed source but will made open source at some point in the future.\n\n5. **Market History:** crvUSD is a stablecoin launched by Curve Finance approximately 6 months ago. crvUSD has several mechanisms in place that keep the price pegged to $1 USD, and prevent depegs in either direction. crvUSD currently has approximately 1000 holders at the time of this proposal and supply of around $155m. We have seen steady growth since launch and expect the crvUSD market to continue growing well into 2024. Reference links below:\n\nhttps://resources.curve.fi/crvusd/faq/#can-other-types-of-collateral-be-proposed-for-crvusd-how-does-that-process-work\n\nhttps://github.com/curvefi/curve-stablecoin/blob/master/doc/curve-stablecoin.pdf\n\nhttps://curvemonitor.com/#/platform/crvusd\n\nPrice Aggregator:  https://etherscan.io/address/0xe5Afcf332a5457E8FafCD668BcE3dF953762Dfe7\n\n6. **Value:** Curve is looking to expand both the growth and cross-chain presence and adoption of crvUSD. Balancer and Curve will be the primary liquidity on Gnosis chain for crvUSD. As of this post and until NG pool factories are up and running on gnosis, Balancer will serve as the primary source of crvUSD liquidity. We have paired with yield bearing sDAI, and are hopeful this pairing will generate fees and revenue for LP's and Balancer protocol.\n\ncrvUSD/sDAI pool address on Gnosis chain:  0xc9F00C3a713008DDf69b768d90d4978549bFDF94\n\ncrvUSD/sDAI gauge address on Gnosis chain:  0xB079bD76dD9b5F9a8d3954E4250FC25BE0549Ac0\n\ncrvUSD/sDAI root gauge factory on mainnet: 0xCEB17D5C8ef8556ed0424A4bebC35a5d562d96E2\n\nSpecification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xCEB17D5C8ef8556ed0424A4bebC35a5d562d96E2`\ngaugeType(string): `Gnosis`",

The protocol aims to streamline interactions with decentralized finance, making it more cost-efficient and profitable through differentiated fund management strategies. Zunami's main product is the UZD stablecoin, which is designed as a rebase token that increases in value proportionally to the APY (annual percentage yield) of the Zunami Protocol. UZD is over-collateralized by stablecoins allocated in revenue-generating strategies and minted using ZLP. The UZD design guarantees protection against depeg as it is fully backed by stablecoins stored in yield pools generating income, ensuring it can be redeemed at any time.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The Zunami team plans to create a pool with deep liquidity on Balancer and seed the pool with initial liquidity. The design of the UZD stablecoin involves deactivating the rebase mechanism while it is in the pool, directing revenue from collateral to the treasury for LP yield maintenance. As a result, the profits from the UZD in the UZD/bb-a-USD pool will be utilized as bribes on Aura through Hidden Hands. We believe that connecting the UZD pool to BAL emissions has a positive impact on Balancer as a new UZD pool with a high APY can attract more users. Zunami intends to become a stable and long-term Briber, while also planning to include some Balancer pools in the ETH and USD Zunami omni pools to provide liquidity.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Zunami operates as a decentralized protocol managed by the DAO. We have not yet launched our token, so the votes are currently distributed among Zunami LP, UZD holders, and UZD pools LP in proportion to their investments in Zunami products, and all key decisions are made via voting on the snapshot platform. While the team multisig currently holds all control, the smart contract allows them to add new strategies only after a one-day pause. In the future, Zunami plans to launch its own governance token, ZUN, and transition to a completely on-chain DAO model.\n2. **Oracles:** Zunami does not use oracles that can somehow affect the price of collaterals or UZD.\n\n3. **Audits:** The current version of Zunami and its stablecoin UZD have been audited by Ackee Blockchain and HashEx. The audit reports can be found at the following links:\n\n> [ZunamiProtocol/Zunami Audit Report v1.1.pdf at main · ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiProtocol · GitHub](https://github.com/ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiProtocol/blob/main/audit/Zunami%20Audit%20Report%20v1.1.pdf)\n[ZunamiStable/abch-zunami-uzd-report.pdf at main · ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiStable · GitHub](https://github.com/ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiStable/blob/main/audit/abch-zunami-uzd-report.pdf)\nhttps://hashex.org/audits/zunami-protocol/\nhttps://hashex.org/audits/zunami-protocol-uzd/\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** There’s no single person or dev with admin controls over the protocol. But the main actions, such as adding new strategies, assigning a default strategy for input and output, as well as rebalancing funds between strategies, are carried out using a Team multi-sig 0xb056B9A45f09b006eC7a69770A65339586231a34\n\n5. **Market History:** UZD was launched 1,5 Month ago on Curve in a pair with FRAXBP and has a TVL of over $1.8 million. Since its inception, there have been no significant deviations from the $1 price.\n \n6. **Value:** Zunami plans to attract more users by creating a high-APY UZD/bb-a-USD pool and becoming a stable long-term briber on hidden hands\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv3 `0x5efBb12F01f27F0E020565866effC1dA491E91A4` and call the `addEthereumGauge` function with the following argument:\n\n`0x21cf9324d5b1ac739b7e6922b69500f1eedb52e0` which corresponds to the capped gauge for this pool.",
