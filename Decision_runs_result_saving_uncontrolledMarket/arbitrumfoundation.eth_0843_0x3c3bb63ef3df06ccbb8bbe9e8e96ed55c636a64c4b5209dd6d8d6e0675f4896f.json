    "ai_final_reason": "- The timeline analysis shows near unanimous early and sustained support for approval, indicating strong voter conviction.\n- The proposal addresses previous criticisms by implementing sybil-resistant mechanisms via Farcaster and focused campaigns, aiming to improve user quality and retention.\n- Market and TVL impacts were modest and not conclusive for decision-making; the positive ecosystem integrations and infrastructure building weigh in favor.\n- Forum sentiment was mixed but leaned slightly positive, with key community voices supporting funding due to Boost's prior achievements and innovative approach.\n- Historical similar proposals also recommended funding and led to increased activity, though with some volatility; lessons learned have been incorporated into this addendum.\n- Overall, the recommendation to approve funding mirrors aggregated voter sentiment and aims to maximize long-term organizational benefit through sustained, quality user growth.",
