        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.

This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.\n\n## **Motivation**:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**:\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with the following assets for collateral: CAKE, BNB, BTCB, WETH, USDC, and USDT. The table below provides the suggested risk parameters for each asset.\n\n|Risk Parameter|CAKE|BNB|BTCB|WETH|USDC|USDT|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|YES|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|NO|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|NO|NO|NO|NO|YES|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|55.00%|70.00%|70.00%|80.00%|77.50%|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|61.00%|75.00%|75.00%|82.50%|80.00%|80.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|5.00%|5.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|20.00%|20.00%|15.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,800,000|42,000|115|3,300.00|20,000,000*|20,000,000*|\n|Supply Cap|5,300,000|46,000|210|6,000.00|50,000,000*|50,000,000*|\n|Debt Ceiling|$10,000,000|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Stable Borrowing|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|uOptimal|45%|45%|45%|80%|90%|80%|\n|Base|0%|0%|0%|1%|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|7%|7%|3.80%|4%|4%|\n|Slope2|300%|300%|300%|80%|60%|75%|\n\n## **Deployment Checklist:**\n\n- Risk service providers feedback ✔\n- BGD Labs [Infrastructure/technical evaluation Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bnb-chain-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/13752)  ✔ \n- Oracle recommendation ✔ ([Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=bnb-chain))\n- The graph support ✔\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance  ✔ \n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~70$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1.

        "body": "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings\n\nAuthor: @Dydymoon\n\nDate: 2023-08-29\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Proposal resubmitted as the last vote didn't reached the quorum.*\n\n# Summary\nExplain AIP-42 proposal & gauge the community thoughts to update the strategic assets from veBAL to an alternative solution increasing the emission power considering current metrics.\n\n# Background\nIn March 2022, Llama proposed a strategic partnership with Balancer (Part I & Part II). The DAO used the BAL to buy B-80BAL-20WETH LP tokens, that would be locked for veBAL. This position was meant to be used for its emission power, enabling rewards redirection on AAVE & GHO gauges.\n\nThis estimated veBAL position & market metrics at the time were taken into account for the SM upgrade proposals (which includes migrating the current LPs to Balancer V2, implement new categories & slashing parameters, define the smBPT gauges, updates incentives management, create a strategic asset management framework, and further considerations.)\n\nConsidering that veBAL was likely to be needed before the SM upgrade implementation, Llama introduced the StrategicAssetsManager contract, creating a base framework to manage assets from Goverance or with a committee. The TEMP check vote ended mid July, and the contract was submitted to BGD for review after.\n\nFrom Llama’s side, the code supporting veBAL position is already implemented via the StrategicAssetManager contract and can be deployed pending community feedback. However, an external proposal from Aura drastically impacted the veBAL strategy early August.\n\n# Motivation\nOn July 28th, a proposal (AIP-42) was submitted 4 on the Aura governance forum, with the goal of improving $AURA distribution efficiency especially on L2s and alignment of parties receiving Aura rewards.\n\nWhile there are benefits for Aura and vlAURA holders, this proposal also directly impacts veBAL holders in several ways, which is why the Aave DAO should be aware of it.\n\nThe proposal (approved on August 6th) considerably impacts the $AURA emissions by reducing the base distribution by 60%, which is compensated by $AURA distributed from the treasury, but only to vlAURA voters according to their voting weight on gauges.\n\nAs a reminder, there are min & max APR on Balancer, depending on veBAL holdings/boost acquired, while Aura is using its share of the veBAL supply to boost LPs & add AURA rewards in return of a fee on BAL rewards, making it more efficient for most LPs to deposit.\n\nFor this reason, the value of incentives generated per 1$ of bribes can take into account BAL + AURA emissions, which was equivalent before AIP-42 (i.e you’d get the same emission power by farming on Aura & voting with veBAL or with vlAURA)\n\n*Post AIP-42 this changes, because:*\n\n* veBAL emission power is limited to BAL + base Aura rewards (reduced by 60%)\n* vlAURA emission power is increased with BAL + base AURA + additional AURA rewards from Treasury\n\nAura will keep boosting LPs with its veBAL share, and should keep a higher APR than Balancer for depositors.\n\nConsidering that emissions changes took effect on August 24th on Aura, it’s still early to draw conclusions and it might take time for the market to react & adapt. While some changes can already be observed, it might take at least 1-2 extra rounds (2-4 weeks) for the market to normalize.\n\n## Potential impacts of AIP-42 related to Aave utilization:\n\n### veBAL emission power reduced:\n\nAs only vlAURA can redirect extra rewards from the treasury, 1 veBAL will have less emission power than the equivalent vote in vlAURA.\n\n### veBAL holders migration to vlAURA:\n\nAssuming that veBAL holders are considering to switch to vlAURA, it could have several sub impacts:\n\n* veBAL holders choosing to let their position decay to exit (increased BAL emission per veBAL: temporary if ppl then migrate to auraBAL or another wrapper effectively relocking veBAL, but not if assets are sold for AURA and locked.)\n\n* If veBAL holders sell their BPT for AURA on market, the AURA price would increase because of the limited liquidity. It could also impact BAL price and B-80BAL-20WETH liquidity.\n\n* If the veBAL accumulation by Aura protocol is not following this potential migration, it would lead to a dilution of the veBAL underlying vote per vlAURA (a small decrease was already visible over the past days, to 0,1587 veBAL/vlAURA currently)\n\n### veBAL/vlAURA bribe cost update by the market:\n\nSome changes are already visible on bribe marketplaces, but we should expect more updates to happen in the coming weeks: Since veBAL has less emission power, the bribe cost should also decrease. On the other side, since the overall AURA emission is lower, so the bribe cost also seem to decrease, but the value / veBAL vote should increase, creating a decorrelation in the pricing depending on which asset is bribed. Another aspect to take in consideration post AIP-42 is the proportion of vlAURA votes / total votes bribed.\n\nBefore Aura proposal, the emissions were equivalent, but now, whether the split is 20% veBAL 80% vlAURA or the opposite considerably changes the results, so it’s most likely to see vlAURA bribed first.\n\n### Pros of switching to vlAURA:\n\n* Max emission power on DAO owned strategic assets\n* 4 months lock (compared to veBAL lock time is 1 year)\n* No decay on vlAURA, meaning no need to relock weekly\n* Voting are calculated in round (2 weeks) so less votes to cast\n\n### Cons of switching to vlAURA:\n\n* Liquidity is small so it can be an issue if Aave DAO wants to acquire AURA on market but OTC deals can be considered\n* Risk of efficiency reduction if the Aura protocol BAL accumulation doesn’t follow the vlAURA supply increase.\n* No veBoost on vlAURA (but Aura deposits are boosted with their veBAL share)\n\nvlAURA allows for more agile management. Considering that Aave DAO voted to lock veBAL but didn’t lock it yet, it makes sense to consider an update of the strategic assets allocation.\n\n# Other Considerations:\n\n* Long-standing strategic relationship between Aave and Balancer\n* Cost of selling B-80BAL-20WETH BPT\n* Cost of acquiring vlAURA via OTC deals\n* Understanding any potential security and ecosystem risks involved\n* Dev resources to add vlAURA support to current StrategicAssetManager\n* Review time by BGD of the vlAURA implementation\n\n# Specifications:\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to consider an update of the Balancer ecosystem holdings (B-80BAL-20WETH) for an alternative solution. This would mean dedicating part (or all) of the current B-80BAL-20WETH holdings to acquiring vlAURA in order to retain the max emission capacity of the voting power held by the DAO.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, ARFCs will be published:\n\n* To add vlAURA support to the StrategicAssetManager contract (Llama)\n* To share options considered for AURA tokens acquisition (TokenLogic)\n\n# Disclaimer:\nCurrently contributing to TokenLogic & Llama as a strategist, I participated in the Llama proposals mentioned above and am currently working on SM strategy, as well as on the GHO liquidity strategy with TokenLogic.\n\nThe analysis can be useful for both purposes above but is published on my own initiative, so this proposal is not requesting compensation from any third party. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared to facilitate understanding & community discussion.\n\n# Next Steps:\nTEMP CHECK: Gather community feedback and sentiment towards the proposal of updating Balancer ecosystem holdings for a more efficient solution with the following voting options:\n\n- YAE (Update the strategy)\n- NAY (Use veBAL as intially voted)\n- ABSTAIN\n\nARFCs: If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\nAIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",

It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC\n\nTEMP CHECKs serve as \"temperature checks\" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.\n\nConversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.\n\n### Proposal Template\n\nEach proposal **must** include the following sections:\n\nA header:\n1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.\n2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.\n3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nA proposal body:\n\n1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.\n2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.\n5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.\n6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.\n\n### Voting Guidelines\n\n1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.\n2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.\n3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.\n4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.\n5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.\n6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.\n\n### Proposal Cycle:\n\n![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nThis framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community.\n\nThis framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community's views.\n\n## Specification\n\nAs this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps \n\n1) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2) If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
