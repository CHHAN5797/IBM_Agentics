While prior funding led to significant growth in volume and users, many community members express concerns about sustainability, transparency, and lasting impact. The timeline voting metrics show near-unanimous early support, but forum sentiment is predominantly negative or cautious. Similar past proposals were approved and resulted in positive growth, but the community is wary of repeating the same without stronger proof of lasting value.",

      "Previous STIP funding led to 2x increase in active users and 3x increase in swaps, demonstrating effective growth.",
      "Redistribution of incentives focuses more on cost-effective swap rebates and strategic partnerships to drive engagement.",
      "Detailed distribution mechanisms and reporting have been provided, enhancing transparency compared to previous rounds.",

    "ai_final_reason": "- Timeline voting metrics indicate a strong early lead for 'Approve funding', but this may reflect initial optimism rather than sustained community conviction.\n- Forum sentiment is predominantly negative (10 negative, 2 positive, 5 neutral), highlighting concerns about sustainability, transparency, and the unclear long-term benefit of continuing funding.\n- Similar past proposals were approved and led to positive growth, but the community stresses the need for more compelling evidence before further allocation.\n- Market impacts show slight price decline and modest TVL increase, but these do not override concerns about durable value.\n- The recommendation to reject funding diverges from timeline voting lead but aligns better with aggregated community sentiment and prudent stewardship of funds.\n- This recommendation does not mirror the timeline-based recommendation but better reflects forum sentiment, thus maximizing the organization's durable benefit.",
