        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/383\n\n**Summary**\nThis proposal is to add a veBAL gauge for the new 80IDLE/20USDC pools on Ethereum.\n\n**References/Useful links**\nIdle’s link to:\n• [Website](https://idle.finance/#/)\n• [Documentation](https://docs.idle.finance/)\n• [Github Page](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/)\n• [Communiy on Discord]()\n\n**Protocol Description**\nIdle launched the Best Yield in [2019](https://medium.com/idle-finance/idle-tokenizing-the-best-interest-rate-among-ethereum-money-market-9a5ab30ea585), a yield aggregation and optimization strategy, allowing LPs to automatically receive the best return across Aave and Compound without the need to monitor the performances of the underlying markets.\n\nIn [2021](https://medium.com/idle-finance/introducing-perpetual-yield-tranches-guarded-launch-phase-1-12978c25b0f0), Idle released Perpetual Yield Tranches, a new risk-tranching primitive to access emerging markets with two different risk-return profiles: Senior and Junior.\n\n[This year](https://medium.com/idle-finance/beyond-the-yield-spectrum-introducing-junior-best-yield-vaults-a1402909e449), Idle merged the power of Best Yield aggregation with the risk-adjusted returns of Perpetual Yield Tranches. Senior Best Yield, the evolution of the original Best Yield, expands the underlying sources by adding Senior Tranches alongside Aave and Compound, maintaining the same conservative risk profile while extending and improving the yield spectrum. Junior Best Yield aggregates multiple Junior Perpetual Yield Tranches to create a seamless yield generation of boosted performances.\n\nIdle’s product suite is governed by [Idle DAO](https://docs.idle.finance/governance/idle-dao), represented by [IDLE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x875773784af8135ea0ef43b5a374aad105c5d39e) token holders.\n\n**Motivation**\nAfter the release of the Balancer boosted pool [bb-i-usd](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x60683b05e9a39e3509d8fdb9c959f23170f8a0fa000000000000000000000489), currently sitting at $1.8m liquidity, a [new governance proposal](https://gov.idle.finance/t/amm-liquidity-improvements/1176) has been posted on the Idle forum.\n\nThis proposal aims to increase current protocol-owned liquidity by 2x by launching the 80IDLE-20USDC pool on Balancer and deploying treasury funds.\n\nThe [pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x158e0fbc2271e1dcebadd365a22e2b4dd173c0db0002000000000000000005a5) has already been seeded by Idle DAO.\n\nBy incentivizing veBAL voters as a form of LM, we identified the next steps to adopt the 80-20 model and make it a core infrastructure for IDLE liquidity provision.\n\nThe use of an 80-20 pool would reduce liquidity provision’s barriers for IDLE token holders, given the limited pool share of non-IDLE assets, and incentivize its decentralized nature.\n\n**Specifications**\n1. Governance: USDC is centralized and does not have a governance forum. Idle’s governance details can be seen [here](https://docs.idle.finance/governance/introduction).\n2. Oracles: Idle does not rely on oracles for fund allocations. Chainlink is used for IDLE liquidity mining on Senior Best Yield.\n3. Audits: See Idle’s [here](https://docs.idle.finance/developers/security)\n4. Centralization vectors: USDC is inherently centralized.\n5. Market History: See USDC [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin).\n6. Value: The pool aims to be the primary source of liquidity for the token.\n\nLink to pool: [0x158e0fbc2271e1dcebadd365a22e2b4dd173c0db0002000000000000000005a5](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x158e0fbc2271e1dcebadd365a22e2b4dd173c0db0002000000000000000005a5)\nLink to gauge: [0x9aaAf6757BE9e115895429EF6B81e05dCB951646](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9aaAf6757BE9e115895429EF6B81e05dCB951646#readContract)\n\n**Specification**\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x9aaAf6757BE9e115895429EF6B81e05dCB951646`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\nThis gauge is initially set with a 2% cap.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/398\n\n**Summary:**\n\n> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory v5 and contains two separate linear pool tokens; bb-a-USDC and bb-a-USDC. These are Balancer’s AAVE boosted Arbitrum native USDC, and bridged USDC. As Circle migrates from bridged to native USDC there are several dexes offering the ability to swap between both assets, which do bring in considerable volume. Balancer protocol will be earning yield on both boosted portions of this pool, making the token pairing more efficient for LPs. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> USDC: Link to:\n> • [Website ](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)\n> • [Documentation ](https://developers.circle.com/docs/what-is-usdc)\n> • [Github Page ](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens)\n> • [Communities ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin) - Coingecko link\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> bb-a-USDC is a Balancer’s USDC boosted token implementation of USDC, leveraging AAVE’s boosted strategy. USDCe is bridged USDC from mainnet to Arbitrum.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> This provides a trading route between the two USDC assets on Arbitrum. With the boosted aspect, an A of 5000, and swap fee of 0.005%, this swap route highly competitive, and more sustainable for liquidity providers to place their funds. The risk of a high A factor exposing the pool to being off balance is mute due the assets being virtually interchangeable. Competitors use higher swap fees and see utilization upwards of 100%. \n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** USDC is centralized and does not have a governance forum. \n2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.\n3. **Audits:** N/A\n4. **Centralization vectors:** USDC is inherently centralized. \n5. **Market History:** See [here ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdc).\n6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on underlying bb-a-USDC and bb-a-USDCe yield. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.\n\nLink to pool [0x9ceBf13BB702F253AbF1579294694A1eDAD00EAA](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x9cebf13bb702f253abf1579294694a1edad00eaa000000000000000000000486)\nLink to gauge: [0x90DDAa2A6D192Db2F47195d847626F94E940c7Ac](https://etherscan.io/address/0x90DDAa2A6D192Db2F47195d847626F94E940c7Ac)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x90DDAa2A6D192Db2F47195d847626F94E940c7Ac`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "PR With Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1421\n\n**Summary**\n> This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge on Ethereum for a USDC/GYD E-CLP. \n\n**References/Useful links**\n\n> Links\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\n>* GYD is a USD denominated meta-stablecoin, issued by [Gyroscope](https://gyro.finance/).\n>* USDC is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc).\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\n> This USDC/GYD pool has a tighter price range (1 +/- 4 bps) than the previously deployed [USDC/GYD pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0xc2aa60465bffa1a88f5ba471a59ca0435c3ec5c1/) which has currently 1.3m USD in TVL. This pool is intended to better match the historic prices and low volatility of the included tokens. \n\n**Specification**\n \n>1. **Governance:** The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n>\n>\n>2. **Oracles:** \n> * ‘rateProvider0’: 0x00\n> *  ‘rateProvider1’: 0x00\n>\n>3. **Audits:** Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production since November 2022.\n>\n>4. **Centralization vectors:** No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n>\n>5. **Market History:** This USDC/GYD pool has a tighter range than the previously deployed [USDC/GYD pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0xc2aa60465bffa1a88f5ba471a59ca0435c3ec5c1/) who has currently 1.3m USD in TVL.\n>\n>6. **Value:** This pool is intended to better match the historic prices and low volatility of the included tokens. \n\n#### Contracts\n\n> * E-CLP: [0x2875f3effe9ec897d7e4c32680d77ca3e628f33a](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2875f3effe9ec897d7e4c32680d77ca3e628f33a)\n>* Gauge: [0x9c1a157cf8b242f67b3c950eda9a30b320bde9cd](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9c1a157cf8b242f67b3c950eda9a30b320bde9cd)\n\n\n#### Specification\n\n\n>Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>gauge(address): `0x9c1a157cf8b242f67b3c950eda9a30b320bde9cd`\n>gaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
