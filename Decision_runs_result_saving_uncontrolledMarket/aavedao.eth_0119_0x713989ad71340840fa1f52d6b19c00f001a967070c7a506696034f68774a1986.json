Neon EVM allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps on Solana and access its native ecosystem and network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities without changing their codebases. Neon EVM currently has interoperability with Solana SPL tokens and the plan is to develop full interoperability with Solana smart contracts as well in 2024.\n\nSolana is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. Solana ecosystem took a hit due to market conditions and FTX situation last year as TVL fell from all-time high of +$9b to +$250m in July 2023 but since then it has shown strong growth and it’s the fastest growing ecosystem across major blockchain networks. Current TVL is over $1.5b making it the fifth-largest chain by TVL.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave has emerged as a prominent player in DeFi lending across various EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, including Ethereum, alt L1s, and L2s. Neon EVM wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Neon EVM Mainnet to expand lending to the Solana ecosystem. Aave’s expansion to the largest non-EVM ecosystem will further reinforce its place as the top liquidity market on-chain and open up possibilities for growth and collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and Neon EVM communities.\n\nAave V3 deployment on Neon EVM will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Solana and enables Solana ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through Neon EVM. The platform will allow Aave to deploy on Solana without any reconfiguration of the Aave v3 codebase and hence without incurring major development efforts and costs to the Aave DAO. Also, a third-party team has already deployed Aave V3 fork on Neon EVM Devnet which implies the full compatibility of Aave V3 codebase with Neon EVM.\n\nThese benefits of Neon EVM combined with Aave’s impressive push for a cross-chain future, provide an exciting opportunity to capture the market share of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and grow the user base and community of the protocol, increase TVL, and protocol revenue. At the same time, Neon EVM would benefit from having a trusted, flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users and wider Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe deployment of Aave v3 on the Neon EVM would enable Aave to tap into the Solana DeFi market and make a unique and significant contribution to the decentralized finance movement. This deployment is expected to substantially reduce costs and better scalability in comparison to EVM networks, while also providing users with access to Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. As Solana gains momentum as a prominent blockchain platform, the integration of Aave’s advanced lending and borrowing protocol could further catalyze the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and Neon EVM.\n\nThere have been significant concerns around the Downtime of Solana blockchain in the past but continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new tools are rolling out on a continuous basis to make the network more resilient, efficient and scalable. For e.g. Firedancer 2 by Jump Crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of Aave v3 deployment on Neon EVM was also recently mentioned by Stani and contributing teams like Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). Tweet by Stani 26, Tweet by Marc Zeller 25\n\nAdditionally, Neon EVM also recently announced the launch of Neon Points Program 10 to attract users and builders to accelerate the adoption of the network. We will include Aave in our points program to incentivize user activity on Aave v3 on Neon EVM with boosted points.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Mainnet with limited deployment of initial assets and conservative risk parameters.This approach will enable Aave to strategically establish a presence in the Solana ecosystem while minimizing risk exposure.\n\nThe proposal suggests three collaterals (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL 1) and one borrowable asset (USDC) with no isolated mode, e-mode enabled for correlated assets (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL), conservative LTV and supply, borrow caps. If this proposal is to pass, we will conduct a comprehensive technical risk assessment for the suggested assets at the ARFC phase to determine their risk parameters. We also invite risk service providers and community members to provide their analysis.\n\n# Infraestructure\n\n- Documentation: [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/quick_start)\n\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Neon EVM supports almost all standards. Here is the link to supported JSON-RPC - [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods)\n\n- Indexers: theGraph\n\n- Oracles: Chainlink, Pyth\n\n- Wallets: Metamask, Ledger and support other EVM network wallets.\n\n- Block explorers: [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/),  [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/)\n\n- Address formatting: It is the same as the standard Ethereum address.\n\n- On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Friendly fork of Gnosis Safe.\n\n- Cross-chain Interactions: [deBridge](https://debridge.finance/) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance/status/1737812739320599032), expected to go live on Mainnet in January)\n\n- NeonPass: NeonPass links Solana and Neon EVM to provide a smoother EVM-compatibility experience for end users (https://neonpass.live/). NeonPass is the revolving door of liquidity between Solana and Neon EVM. NeonPass is not a bridge connecting two separate blockchain ecosystems. Rather, it acts as a two-way transfer tool for bringing assets in and out of the Neon EVM platform, which itself is a Solana smart contract directly connected to the network.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Neon Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Neon Foundation and holds SOL, NEON tokens.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM and proceed with Snapshot if positive.\n\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n# Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "## [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on BOB\n\n## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-12-18\n\n**Simple Summary**:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of an Aave V3 pool on BOB, a hybrid L2 that strives to combine the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBOB (\"Build on Bitcoin\") is a Hybrid Layer-2 blockchain that combines the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum to create the home for Bitcoin DeFi. The unique Hybrid L2 model merges the strengths of both ecosystems—Bitcoin's security and dormant capital, with Ethereum's DeFi innovation and versatility. As a [Hybrid L2](https://docs.gobob.xyz/whitepaper.pdf) BOB will inherit security from Bitcoin, as the most secure and decentralized network. Bitcoin security is then used to create trust-minimized bridges to Bitcoin (via BitVM2), Ethereum, and eventually other L1s. As a result, the Hybrid L2 does not need to rely on third-party bridges for interoperability, concentrating liquidity around Bitcoin instead of fragmenting it across chains.\n\nBOB’s mainnet Phase 1 has been live since May 2024, bootstrapped as an ETH L2 and member of the OP Superchain with an ecosystem of 100+ projects live or building (incl. Uniswap, Solv, Sovryn etc.). BOB has successfully captured the growing interest in Bitcoin staking and yield-bearing assets, achieving [∽$250m in DeFi TVL](https://defillama.com/chain/BOB) and [320k unique users](https://explorer.gobob.xyz/stats) since launch and growing. BOB supports decentralized tBTC as well as institutional wBTC, FBTC and SolvBTC as BTC bridges (more soon), as well as numerous Bitcoin LSTs including SolvBTC.BBN, Lombard LBTC, UniBTC and PumpBTC (more soon). The novel [BOB Stake](https://app.gobob.xyz/stake) product allows holders to deploy BTC into any BTC DeFi position with just 1 Bitcoin transaction (via intents) and has been used by 28k users.\n\nBOB is an active contributor to BitVM (co-founder Alexei is one of the co-authors of the [BitVM2 and BitVM Bridge technical paper](https://bitvm.org/bitvm_bridge.pdf), the design currently being implemented on the [official open-source repository](https://github.com/BitVM/BitVM)). As of today, BitVM is the only known solution that can achieve trust-minimized and arguably “non-custodial” Bitcoin bridging and unlock billions of USD in dormant BTC liquidity. BOB mainnet Phase 2 which introduces Bitcoin finality and the trust-minimized BitVM bridge will be rolling out in Q1 2025.\n\n**Reasons for deployment**\n\n1. **First mover in Bitcoin DeFi and BTC LSTs**\n    1. With a deployment on BOB, Aave can solidify its position as the leading marketplace for BTC loans, and capture the growing BTC LST market. Already [$6bn](https://btcstaking.babylonlabs.io/) of BTC have been staked within months of Babylon launch. Drawing parallels to the success of ETH LSTs (46bn), we anticipate a 200bn+ BTC staking market in the next 3-5 years given Bitcoin's market size.\n    2. Currently [$4bn](https://app.aave.com/markets/?marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) of wBTC are deployed into Aave without generating any interest. By allowing users to build up leveraged BTC LST positions, we confidently estimate Aave can generate 3-5% APY for wBTC holders. This could result in up to $250m in monthly borrowing fees, not accounting for additional liquidation and flash loan fees.\n    3. BOB and Babylon are strategic partners: as a Bitcoin-Secured Network, BOB’s network fees contribute to the rewards of BTC stakers. This creates a positive reinforcement loop: the more BTC LST liquidity on BOB, the more DeFi activity, the more fees accrue to BTC stakers. This encourages more BTC to be staked, which brings more DeFi activity, and the flywheel continues.\n    4. All major Bitcoin LSTs are already supported on BOB: SolvBTC, Lombard LBTC, UniBTC, PumpBTC with 200m+ deployed, and more integrations on the way. This makes BOB the best place for BTC LST DeFi.\n2. **Trust-minimized BTC bridges**\n    1. BOB is developing a trustless BitVM-based BTC bridge, gradually rolling out from Q1 2025 onward.\n    2. BOB has been actively working with tBTC since May 2024, becoming one of the largest L2s in tBTC on-chain DeFi liquidity (2nd only to Base).\n    3. This way BOB covers the 2 possible approaches to trust-minimized BTC bridging:\n        1. Best today: TSS/decentralized multisig via tBTC (n-of-m honest majority). Battletested 2+ years with 500m in TVL.\n        2. Best in the future: Fraud-proof based via BitVM (1-of-n, existential honesty like native ETH L2 bridges)\n3. **Aave as backend for 5m+ retail BTC users w. 1-click deposits**\n    1. BOB allows users to deposit BTC into Aave and borrow against with just 1 BTC transaction, solving Bitcoin's long-standing DeFi UX problem. The underlying technology is the first-ever instance of [Bitcoin intents](https://blog.gobob.xyz/posts/bob-gateway-connecting-bitcoin-through-intents).\n    2. [BOB Stake](https://blog.gobob.xyz/posts/stake-btc-in-a-single-click-with-bob-stake), a 1-click BTC staking SDK built with Bitcoin intents, has been used by 28k users and is currently being integrated by StakingRewards.com, Xverse wallet, Everstake, Pell and others - soon offering 1-click DeFi access to 5m+ BTC users.\n    3. BOB will integrate Aave such that BTC holders can supply BTC, borrow against BTC or run strategies with just 1 BTC transaction from all major BTC wallets. This will help position Aave as the go-to lending market for the Bitcoin community.\n4. **Access to Institutional BTC liquidity**\n    1. While trust-minimized BTC bridges are the future of Bitcoin DeFi, their adoption will likely take at least another 2-3 years given the technical risks associated with new bridge technologies (feedback collected from over 50+ BTC whales and institutional LPs). BitVM is the perceived future and there is a lot of interest in its success. However, until BitVM is live on mainnet and sufficiently battle-tested, the majority of BTC liquidity prefers to use institutional custody solutions.\n    2. BOB already supports native minting of FBTC, SolvBTC, and BTC LSTs such as SolvBTC.BBN, Lombard LBTC, uniBTC and PumpBTC. wBTC is supported via ETH, with native minting expected in Q1 via LayerZero\n    3. Together with existing (Cobo) and upcoming (e.g. Fireblocks, …) institutional custody integrations, BOB is best positioned to capture the growing institutional interest in BTC DeFi.\n5. **Best-in-class liquidity onramps**\n    1. Trustless access to ETH and ERC20s via native L2 bridge (OP stack)\n    2. Native support for USDT and USDC.e via Ethereum\n    3. CCIP support for fast on/off-ramps\n    4. Direct deposits from CEXes going live Q4 2024\n6. **Support and growth of GHO in BOB's DeFi ecosystem**\n    1. BOB is keen to support and grow GHO liquidity as parts of its DeFi liquidity campaigns. This will serve to position GHO as one of the main decentralized stablecoins borrowed / minted against BTC - taking advantage of Bitcoin's validated PMF as the best collateral asset in DeFi.\n7. **Liquidity Provision**\n    1. BOB boasts a growing DeFi ecosystem: $350m on-chain deposits ([source: Dune](https://dune.com/daedalus_angels/build-on-bitcoin-bob-overview)) of which $250m are deployed in DeFi across Tier-1 protocols ([source: DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/BOB)). Notably, BOB has grown to the #5 Uniswap v3 market in just 2 months ([source: DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap-v3))\n    2. BOB has a conservative estimate of $200m+ in liquidity commitments for Aave across wrapped BTC and BTC LST assets.\n    3. BOB is a OP Superchain member and received a 750k OP grant to boost user activity and DeFi\n    4. BOB is ready to support the Aave deployment via a liquidity program to ensure successful bootstrapping targeting $125m in TVL of wrapped BTC assets, resulting in a total market size of $250m taking into account e-mode and BTC LST markets. BOB has also received commitments from selected LST projects to launch or extend already running liquidity programs to assist with bootstrapping.\n    5. Exact liquidity program details can be determined in the next phase of the deployment process.\n\n**Technical Feasibility**\n\n1. **Integration. BOB is an OP stack chain with 2 second block times and cents for fees. The chain is operated in collaboration with Conduit.In terms of developer tooling and available infrastructure, BOB matches the best in class standards of Optimism and Base. BOB currently uses ETH as fee asset during bootstrapping for compatibility, with BTC support being added via account abstraction and eventually as native fee asset as well. Since Aave is already deployed on Optimism and Base, the deployment to BOB is expected to be straightforward.**\n2. **Price feeds. Chainlink is a strategic partner of BOB and CCIP is going live in December 2024. BOB will ensure ChainLink price feeds are available at the time of Aave deployment.**\n3. **Technical support. BOB Foundation will provide all technical resources needed to support Aave's technical team during deployment and maintenance.**\n\n**Deployment Plan**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Initial Discussion**\n    - Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n2. **Phase 2: Detailed Proposal**\n    - If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n3. **Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring**\n    - Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on BOB and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n**Risks and Mitigations**\n\n1. **Technical Challenges:**\n    - BOB will work closely with Aave’s developers and service providers (such as BGD and ACI) to address any technical challenges during integration.\n2. **Security Risks:**\n    - BOB is an OP Stack chain and Superchain member. The L2 is operated in collaboration with Conduit. BOB will continue working closely with OP Labs and Conduit to ensure secure operation of the OP stack L2. All privileged roles are tracked transparently [here](https://docs.gobob.xyz/learn/reference/privileged-roles).\n    - In addition, BOB is currently onboarding real-time threat detection partners (provider selection ongoing).\n    - BOB follows security best practices, auditing every product launch and future chain-level upgrades ([audit reports](https://docs.gobob.xyz/learn/reference/audits/)), while also operating a [bug bounty program](https://r.xyz/bug-bounty/programs/bob).\n    - This is in addition to the proposal’s review by Aave’s risk managers, Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk.\n3. **Community Adoption:**\n    - BOB will engage with the Aave community throughout the process to ensure alignment and support. BOB's community of Bitcoin builders and enthusiasts counts over 300k members across various channels.\n\n### Links and References:\n\n- BOB\n    - Overview: https://gobob.xyz/summary\n    - Website: https://www.gobob.xyz/\n    - Hybrid L2 Whitepaper: https://docs.gobob.xyz/whitepaper.pdf\n    - Docs: https://docs.gobob.xyz/\n- Aave V3 Technical Documentation: [Aave Protocol Overview](https://docs.aave.com/developers)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not directly affiliated with BOB Foundation and did not receive compensation related to this proposal.

        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "## Author: @ACI\n## Date: 2024-11-13\n\n---\n\n**Proposal Overview:**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK seeks to gauge the Aave community’s interest in deploying Aave V3 on the Spiderchain, the leading Bitcoin EVM L2 developed by Botanix Labs. \n\nBotanix Labs proposes this integration to expand Aave within the emerging Bitcoin DeFi narrative, with the first Bitcoin L2 with a full DeFi ecosystem and the largest community of users - including a new market of Bitcoiners transacting on chain for the first time. Upon mainnet launch, Botanix will also present to the market its synthetic 1:1 representation of Bitcoin on the L2, which will be the most decentralized form of “wrapped” Bitcoin in the EVM ecosystem. \n\nThis can help diversify the type of Bitcoin assets on Aave, especially considering its acceptance by the Bitcoin community. Botanix also intends to incorporate the GHO stablecoin throughout the ecosystem to further strategically align with Aave, providing incremental revenue upside for Aave DAO.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe Spiderchain is the first fully decentralized EVM-equivalent Layer 2 on Bitcoin, where the ease and versatility of EVM meets the decentralization and security of Bitcoin. Leveraging Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) as a Layer 1 for base settlement and decentralization, Botanix Labs will use a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model, where the stakes (represented by bitcoin) are securely stored on the Spiderchain, a distributed network of decentralized multisigs safeguarded by a randomized subset of participants. Botanix runs on Bitcoin, with BTC as the gas token and settlement layer, and yield accrued back to stakers in native BTC. The Spiderchain is the most performant Bitcoin L2 EVM with average block times of ~5 seconds and gas fees of $0.01 per transaction. As noted above, Botanix’ form of “wrapped” Bitcoin will be the most decentralized form of Bitcoin in the L2 EVM ecosystem - with decentralized sequencers available on Day 1. As such, Aave’s counterparty risk with BTC derivatives will be significantly reduced and offer greater asset diversification, especially as the Spiderchain enjoys widespread acceptance within the technical community.\n\nThe Botanix Labs team preempted the Bitcoin Season II narrative and has been building for almost two years. As such, they have already built out the major DeFi primitives required for an end-to-end DeFi experience with ~20 native ecosystem teams and another ~40 dApps (including Tier 1 DeFi protocols such as Vertex, Frax, Kiln, etc.) deploying Day 1 of mainnet. The non-incentivized testnet v0 launched in November 2023 and garnered 1.5M transactions, 500K users/wallets connected, 30K contracts launched community. Botanix Labs also has ~60K highly engaged community members, making it the largest organic community in Bitcoin. Despite not having a chain-level points program, the team has secured significant Day 1 liquidity commitments.\n\nBy deploying Aave V3 on the Spiderchain, they aim to enhance liquidity options and provide users with more opportunities within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Reasons for Integration:**\n\n1. **Early Mover Advantage within Bitcoin DeFi as a Launch Partner**\n    - With a deployment on the Spiderchain, and considering Aave’s brand as the incumbent leader in DeFi, Aave has the potential to capture significant early mover advantage on the only Bitcoin chain with a high-quality DeFi ecosystem as the flagship lending protocol. As the most decentralized Bitcoin-aligned chain, Botanix Labs has also secured net new TVL commitments from BTC whales who have previously never engaged with DeFi.\n2. **Access and Penetration to Bitcoiner userbase**\n    - The Spiderchain plans to be the home of Bitcoin-native DeFi, whereby once a user onboards their Bitcoin to the Botanix EVM, they can have an end-to-end DeFi experience (DEX, stablecoins, lending/borrowing, derivatives, staking, etc.) and experience native bitcoin yield without necessarily bridging to other chains. As such, it attracts a new Bitcoiner profile that is excited about DeFi and the potential of earning yield. With an integration, Aave can attract this new set of on-chain users.\n3. **Integration with GHO within the Spiderchain ecosystem**\n    - Botanix Labs will integrate and support the GHO stablecoin across the ecosystem, as one of the key USD stablecoins that will enable users to borrow against their BTC collateral.\n    - The core product of the GHO stablecoin, backed by BTC, is one of the most anticipated use cases for Bitcoiners and the Botanix team expects rapid adoption of this primitive. Assuming a linear increase in GHO borrowing caps, the team expects a high capture rate of new borrows with Aave DAO being the primary beneficiary in this interest income upside.\n4. **Innovation within Bitcoin Scaling**\n    - The Spiderchain is well accepted as a meaningful technical innovation within the Bitcoin community, with its innovation of decentralized multisigs supported by PoS being recognized as one of the few L2 scaling designs that is possible today on Bitcoin core without any soft forks needed.\n5. **Most Performant Bitcoin L2**\n    - The Spiderchain offers high throughput and low latency, with 5 second block times, which can support Aave’s transaction demands and maintain user experience.\n    - Lower transaction fees on the Spiderchain can reduce operational costs for Aave users and make DeFi activities more affordable.\n6. **Strategic Partnership with Chainlink**\n    - Chainlink Labs is a strategic partner of Botanix Labs, as a key infrastructure and market partner. Botanix Labs will integrate with ChainLink’s Price Feeds as the oracle provider for the market, and with the recently announced Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enhance the functionality and security of Aave on the Spiderchain.\n7. **Liquidity Provision**\n    - As Botanix Labs is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem, they have been able to secure significant liquidity commitments and can bootstrap initial liquidity for Aave to run smoothly upon deployment. Exact LP details can be determined in the next phase of the deployment process, but we can conservatively expect at least $20M in BTC commitments to Aave upon mainnet launch.\n\n**Technical Feasibility:**\n\n1. **Seamless Integration and Compatibility with v4:**\n    - The Spiderchain is EVM-equivalent, running the rust implementation of the EVM (reth), ensuring an easy integration with Aave V3’s existing codebase.\n2. **Chainlink Integration:**\n    - ChainLink’s Price Feeds will be available Day 1 of mainnet, along with CCIP as the canonical bridging partner.\n3. **The Graph Integration:**\n    - Botanix Labs will have The Graph’s subgraph functionality enabled Day 1 of mainnet, ensuring an easy migration for Aave.\n4. **Development and Testing:**\n    - Botanix Labs will coordinate with Aave’s technical team including BGD to ensure a seamless deployment, including comprehensive testing on Botanix’s testnet.\n5. **Security Audits:**\n    - Botanix Labs will work with Aave’s security team to perform thorough audits and ensure that the deployment meets all security standards.\n\n**Deployment Plan:**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Initial Discussion**\n    - Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n2. **Phase 2: Detailed Proposal**\n    - If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n3. **Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring**\n    - Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on the Spiderchain and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n**Risks and Mitigations:**\n\n1. **Technical Challenges:**\n    - Botanix Labs will work closely with Aave’s developers and service providers (such as BGD and ACI) to address any technical challenges during integration.\n2. **Security Risks:**\n    - A comprehensive security audit will be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This would be in addition to the proposal’s review by Aave’s risk managers, Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk.\n3. **Community Adoption:**\n    - They will engage with the Aave community throughout the process to ensure alignment and support.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nWe invite the Aave community to express their support or concerns regarding this TEMP CHECK. Your feedback is crucial in determining whether to proceed with a detailed ARFC for the Aave V3 deployment on the Spiderchain, and will help us ensure that the integration aligns with Aave’s goals and community interests.\n\n**Links and References:**\n\n- The Spiderchain Overview: https://docs.botanixlabs.xyz/botanix-labs/\n- Aave V3 Technical Documentation: https://docs.aave.com/developers\n- Botanix Labs: https://botanixlabs.xyz/\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.\n\nHaving recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).\n\nBenefits for Aave:\n\n* Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.\n* A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n* Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.\n* Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n* Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium's LTIPP.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\nContract Addresses:\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nEthereum: 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\nOptimism: 0x5a61374950D4BFa5a3D4f2CA36FC1d23A92b6f21\n\nUseful Links (the number of posted links is limited to 5 for new users, hence the intended spacing between \"h\" and \"ttps\"):\n\nProject: h ttps://www.threshold.network/\n\nMinting dashboard: h ttps://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint\n\nGitHub: h ttps://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2\n\nDocs: h ttps://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2\n\nAudit: h ttps://threshold.network/about#audits\n\nImmunfi Bug Bounty: h ttps://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\nLlama Risk Report: https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/tBTC\n\nTwitter: h ttps://twitter.com/thetnetwork\n\nDiscord: h ttps://discord.gg/threshold\n\nDune: h ttps://dune.com/threshold/tbtc & h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n\n#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThreshold Network has no link and is not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal.\n\n#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by native BTC. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for native BTC without a centralized custodian. It can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\ntBTC can be used as collateral, liquidity, a store of value, and can be integrated with DeFi apps across all supported blockchains.\n\nAs with other BTC wrappers, tBTC provides cryptocurrency traders and general users with a BTC-pegged token, that can be used to generate yield whilst holding native BTC.\n\n#### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nAdding support for tBTC on Aave V3 as an asset would allow tBTC holders to obtain a yield on their tBTC holdings.\n\nIn Aave’s [document hub](https://docs.aave.com/hub/), the first line self-describes Aave as “a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol”, Threshold Network is looking to help Aave fully realise this by allowing access to tBTC, which unlike its centralized competitor (wBTC), is the only way to permissionlessly borrow and lend BTC in a decentralized manner. This gives Aave direct access to the 1.3 trillion market and 106 million owners of BTC, for which wBTC provides limited access to.\n\n#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n#### How is tBTC currently used?\n\ntBTC is currently used across the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon and Solana ecosystems. tBTC exhibits strong usecase across decentralized exchanges, lending on Solana and Bitcoin Options on Base and as collateral for crvUSD, a broad overview can be found here:\nhttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\n\n#### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation\n\nThe Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:\n\nCouncil Multisig Ethereum Address: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\n#### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $195,000,000 USD / 2,960 BTC\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools: h ttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\nDashboard on Decentralized LP liquidity: h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n#### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 7,251\nTwitter: 37,200\nGithub: 4,596 commits\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of Deployment: February 2023\nNumber of transactions: 27,986\nNumber of token holders: 756\n\n#### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams, we suggest the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nSymbol: TBTC\n\nContract Addresses\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|N/A|\n|Borrow Cap|2 Million USD|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|35%|\n|LT|78%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Threshold Network.

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5.

The voting timeline strongly favors 'YAE' with high stability and early decisive votes.
