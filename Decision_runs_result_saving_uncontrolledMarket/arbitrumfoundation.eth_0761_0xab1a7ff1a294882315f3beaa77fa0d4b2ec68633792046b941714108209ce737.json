In reality, it represents the 3rd proposal after incorporating valuable feedback from community members and key delegates. Below are the links attached for previous proposals.\n\n**1st Proposal (June 2024):** [Proposal Link](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrumhub-evolution-the-next-step-in-streamlining-information-access-and-raising-awareness-for-arbitrum-dao/24857)  \n- **Outcome:** Failed in Snapshot voting  \n- **Community Feedback:** Lacked clear KPIs and a detailed budget breakdown.\n\n**2nd Proposal (November 2024, RFC):** [Proposal Link](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-for-maintenance-and-continuous-enhancement-of-arbitrumhub-to-meet-the-evolving-needs-of-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-and-dao/27667)  \n- **Community Feedback:** Its scope and deliverables were deemed too broad. The feedback emphasized the need to narrow the focus, streamline the deliverables, and \n    reduce the budget. Emphasis was placed on prioritizing content quality and platform maintenance.\n\nWe believe the feedback have played a crucial role in refining our approach and finding the key strategic way for establishing ArbitrumHub as a robust Platform.\n\n### Key Resources:\n- **ArbitrumHub Platform:** [Visit Platform](https://www.arbitrumhub.io/)\n- **ArbitrumHub Research Document:** [View Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XrYF2L30tS4paZs1xwVBagd2BXcH66A2/view) (*Note:* This file is large and may take some time to load. We appreciate your patience.)\n- **GitHub Open-Source Code:** [Access Code](https://github.com/HoomanDigital/ArbitrumDAO_Hub)\n- **Looker Studio Link (for Tracking Platform Analytics):** [View Analytics](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/f0081ef4-8322-4ba7-b685-afcc38547bb8/page/u9hPE)\n\n## Things to Consider While Analyzing the Platform:\nPlease note that some information on the platform may not always be entirely accurate or up-to-date, primarily due to resource constraints. From the past year, we have independently built, managed and maintained the platform using the resources at our disposal. Despite these limitations, we strive to provide the most accurate and updated information, deploying any additional resources to improve its quality.  \nWe encourage you to view this platform as a **proof of concept** for what we aim to achieve. Imagine the possibilities we could unlock with dedicated support and resources from the DAO. The DAO support would enable us to significantly enhance this platform and fully realize its potential.\n\n## DAO Feedback Addressed\nBased on feedback from the DAO, we are considering carrying ArbitrumHub as a pilot for the first year with a limited scope. The core focus will be on addressing content needs and refining the platform based on community feedback, DAO needs while utilizing minimal resources.\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Core Focus on Platform Maintenance:** Prioritizing ongoing platform maintenance and updates over expansion.\n- **Reduced Fragmentation:** We are adopting a focused approach to streamline efforts and consolidate resources, ensuring a strong foundation for ArbitrumHub.\n- **Minimal Resources:** Operating with a minimal resource allocation to ensure efficient use of funds and focus on core needs.\n\n### MSS Setup for Fund Request:\n- **Quarterly Fund Withdrawals:** Funds will be withdrawn on a quarterly basis from the MSS.\n- **Initiative Termination Clause:** The initiative may be stopped if the DAO reaches a consensus that the proposed value is not being delivered at any point.\n\n## Comparison Between Foundation site and ArbitrumHub:\nThe Foundation is one of the bodies of the Arbitrum DAO, focused primarily on providing specific information aimed at builders. Their goal is to make the Arbitrum blockchain more efficient. The Foundation's target audience includes developers and builders, with an emphasis on onboarding them to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIn contrast, ArbitrumHub provides a comprehensive overview of all Arbitrum DAO initiatives, including governance and various ecosystem activities. Our target audience includes individuals involved in governance, Web3 service organizations, strategists, and community members from arbitrum and other DAOs, as well as anyone interested in understanding what Arbitrum has to offer.\n\nAdditionally, ArbitrumHub serves as a platform to showcase community initiatives on a single platform, ensuring better visibility and reach. For instance, the Community Hub serves as a space to highlight community-driven contributions—something that is currently lacking within the Arbitrum ecosystem. ArbitrumHub is fulfilling this need by providing a dedicated space for these initiatives and enhancing the accessibility to everyone.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that the Foundation's website is effective in its purpose, we recognize that the Foundation has a distinct goal and target audience. The Foundation’s internal focus is on improving the Arbitrum blockchain for builders, while their external focus revolves around onboarding builders to the Arbitrum blockchain and presenting relevant information accordingly.\n\n### Foundation Focus:\n- **Internal Focus:** Enhancing the Arbitrum blockchain for builders.\n- **External Focus:** Onboarding builders to the Arbitrum blockchain, with information presented in a way that caters specifically to their needs.\n\n![258d08ba92894870e422a8833fd31aa2d8e6780c_2_592x300[1].jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiav5jw2ddwbev2hgav6tbqpbpavjeqoqzcrx22e6p3zg5b6ybbvx4)\n**Note:** The image above represents the bi-annual progress report, highlighting the scope and target audience of the Arbitrum Foundation. It illustrates how ArbitrumHub complements the Foundation's efforts rather than duplicating them. In fact, ArbitrumHub has previously been utilized by the Foundation to showcase various grant programs and accepted projects. ArbitrumHub aims to serve as a comprehensive, one-stop solution for all things arbitrum. The ArbitrumHub team is committed to collaborating with the Foundation and the leaders of various community initiatives to ensure its relevance across all verticals within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n**Source:** [Arbitrum Foundation Bi-Annual Progress Update H1 2024](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-arbitrum-foundation-bi-annual-progress-update-h1-2024/26538)\n\n## ArbitrumHub Focus:\n- **Internal Focus:** Providing a comprehensive overview of all Arbitrum DAO initiatives, governance, and ecosystem activities, with a strong emphasis on platform maintenance and refinement based on community feedback.\n- **External Focus:** Engaging a broad audience, including governance participants, Web3 organizations, strategists, and community members from other DAOs, by offering insights into what the Arbitrum ecosystem has to offer. Additionally, ArbitrumHub serves as a platform for showcasing community-driven projects and initiatives to enhance visibility and foster collaboration.\n\nPlease check out the [Community Hub](https://www.arbitrumhub.io/community-hub/contributions/guides/) | [Programs Section](https://www.arbitrumhub.io/programs/entropy-advisors).\n\n![7a89e619b21bec15fdb5c061c34129c0af3f9648_2_936x571[1].jpeg](ipfs://bafybeihsexxbiwcoernibrjz6zf5b2wwqhzy4ghvv6k6fzixhcfcxfbgy4)\n\n\n\n# 1. Abstract\n\nThe ArbitrumHub project emerged from over a year of active involvement in the Arbitrum ecosystem, during which we identified a critical need for a unified platform for ArbitrumDAO. Through extensive community engagement, research, and participation in DAO meetings, it became evident that new members, centralized organizations, participants from other DAOs, and young enthusiasts lacked a single point of reference for all developments and initiatives within the ecosystem. To address this gap, we began laying the foundation of ArbitrumHub 1+ year ago. With dedicated research, collaboration with key stakeholders, and a project team committed to design, development, and iteration, ArbitrumHub has evolved into a comprehensive resource at [arbitrumhub.io](https://www.arbitrumhub.io).\n\n![9639757fe0e675e465f7d87a94665d1d575179b0_2_790x750[1].jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibsiuffn6v3v6t7ylxctfduy3ueoxe3ptp6bs3wg7eozdedt5c5b4)\n\n# 2. Motivation\n\nArbitrumHub was created to address the critical need for a centralized resource hub within the ArbitrumDAO community. As the ecosystem expands, it becomes increasingly challenging to stay informed and connected. ArbitrumHub simplifies this process by offering a single, reliable source of essential information, structured in a way that is both accessible and comprehensive. \nArbitrumHub aspires to become the community’s go-to destination for vital insights into ArbitrumDAO and its ongoing initiatives. By maintaining a unified platform, we ensure community members and external participants have access to updates, meeting details, and opportunities to engage with the ecosystem. This approach not only strengthens community involvement but also fosters a more informed and engaged Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n![44b5eceefda5f291ee82b2e86e425ba132f416dd_2_936x630[1].png](ipfs://bafybeieazvqjqvatfzetoiodvu25slxhhgsat7xazfw552jecmbmzl3y6a)\n\n\n# 3. Rationale for DAO Approval\n\nArbitrumHub serves as the essential first point of contact for existing and new users in the Arbitrum ecosystem, consolidating scattered information and providing a continuously updated resource. Given the importance of this platform in fostering ecosystem cohesion and accessibility, we are seeking DAO approval to formalize ArbitrumHub’s role within the ArbitrumDAO structure.\n\nSecuring DAO support would allow us to designate ArbitrumHub as a DAO-backed platform, which we can publicly display in the About section on ArbitrumHub.io, reinforcing its credibility and trust within the ecosystem. Formal approval would also enable a closer working relationship with DAO program managers and delegates, establishing an ongoing feedback loop and creating a foundation for designing and implementing effective Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with key stakeholders. This formalized connection ensures that ArbitrumHub remains aligned with the DAO’s strategic objectives, enhancing the platform’s long-term impact and value to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n![43e45b56a1b48ce31882a32c80856120148c22c8_2_936x724[1].png](ipfs://bafybeicsou6sovh3a6gsnqto3m7speh5nfvshxp6kg5qqfemwaqi7zbkcu)\n\n\n# 4. Key Uses of ArbitrumHub\n\nArbitrumHub is a centralized and open-source platform designed to streamline user access to essential resources, real-time updates, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem. It addresses the need for a unified, easily navigable platform for new and existing users. Key functionalities include:\n\n### a.

We are committed to the platform's growth and its relevance in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n### Notes:\n- This breakdown includes the minimal industry per-hour cost for expert talent, optimized to reduce the hourly commitment of each role while focusing on platform maintenance.\n- The resource allocation and hours have been adjusted based on DAO feedback to ensure efficiency, execution quality, and an appropriate balance of responsibilities for each role.\n- The budget has also been reduced significantly considering the first year being arbitrumhub's pilot to build the strong ground on its relevance and usecases.\n\n## Retroactive Funding \nWe would like to highlight that we have been diligently working on and building this platform over the past year at our own discretion with early starter-grant support from pL labs back in jan-feb 2024. Given the effort and commitment invested for past months at our own discretion, we believe it is reasonable to seek retroactive compensation for the work completed thus far.\n\nWe respectfully request a **minimum of $40k USD** as retroactive funding for over **10+ months of dedicated work**. This request is entirely optional and subject to the discretion of the DAO.\n\nShould the DAO recognize and appreciate our contributions, we would be sincerely grateful. However, if the DAO decides otherwise, we fully understand and respect the decision, acknowledging the dynamics and priorities of the DAO landscape.\n\n\n## Feedback Mechanism and Success Metrics\n\n### Feedback Mechanism\nTo foster continuous improvement and maintain alignment with community/DAO expectations, we have implemented a structured feedback mechanism integrated into our operational processes.

They also offer advanced tools for large-scale monitoring and analytics to empower data-driven decision-making.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nAs Research Members, our primary goal is to strengthen Arbitrum’s position as the leading Layer 2 solution. For any network, the core requirements are a strong developer mindshare and capture, projects that address both emerging and institutional use cases, and deep liquidity across the ecosystem. To address these challenges, we propose the following research initiatives for the first two months.\n\n\n### **1. Expanding Arbitrum’s Ecosystem: A Strategic Analysis of Emerging Untapped Sectors and Institutional Opportunities**\n\n\n\n* Arbitrum has long been a hub for DeFi protocols, and this will continue. However, with the emergence of new market cycles and innovative primitives, it’s crucial to understand and expand into these new areas, both crypto-native and institutional.\n* For example, Polymarket, a prediction market app, accounted for nearly half of Polygon’s transaction volume in October 2024. As new primitives emerge, Arbitrum must capture protocols from these sectors.\n* This research aims to assess where Arbitrum lags behind competing Layer 2 and Layer 1 networks. The study will explore:\n    1. Crypto-native sectors: prediction markets, memecoins, decentralized science (DeSci), gaming, decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), etc.\n    2. Institutional sectors: Treasuries, payments, funds, and bonds\n* We will conduct a data-driven analysis to identify key sectors with little to no presence on Arbitrum, evaluate their growth potential, and develop strategies to attract these protocols to the network.\n\n    Final Outcome: A comprehensive report identifying high-potential crypto-native and institutional sectors currently underrepresented on Arbitrum to develop targeted strategies for attracting protocols and expanding network dominance beyond DeFi.\n\n\n\n### **2. Catalyzing Capital Migration from Ethereum Mainnet to Arbitrum: A Strategic Framework for Liquidity Attraction**\n\nEthereum Mainnet currently has more than $60B of Capital sitting on it. Currently, Arbitrum is leading in terms of attracting these outflows from the Ethereum main net, but with more L1s and L2s coming in it’s necessary to constantly research and strategise on how Arbitrum can be the home for this liquidity.\n\nOur main aim with this research is to analyse the patterns of large capital holders and their migration patterns from the mainnet and interview them to find out any gaps in terms of security, infrastructure, and opportunities.\n\n\n\n* Recent advancements — such as live fraud proofs, enhanced cross-chain infrastructure, and an increasing number of protocols building on Arbitrum—make it the ideal platform for this migration.\n* This research will:\n    * Analyse the risk profiles of large capital holders\n    * Assess the current infrastructure for migration and identify gaps\n    * Engage with capital holders through interviews to develop a strategy for attracting liquidity\n* Key areas of focus will include:\n    * Identifying infrastructural gaps that hinder capital migration\n    * Conducting user interviews to understand views on Layer 2 migration\n    * Analysing capital ownership on the mainnet and categorising entities by likelihood of migration\n    * Exploring short-term strategies and incentives to encourage both migration and long-term retention of liquidity on Arbitrum\n\n    Final Outcome: Develop a comprehensive strategy to facilitate and incentivize the migration of $50 billion in capital from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum by addressing security concerns, infrastructure gaps, and stakeholder needs.\n\n\n\n### **3. Diversifying Arbitrum’s Network Revenue Streams: Beyond Sequencer Fees**\n\nThis research initiative aims to address the critical challenge of developing sustainable revenue streams for the Arbitrum network, acknowledging that the current reliance on sequencer fees is not sufficient for long-term sustainability. The study will conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential revenue models, examining both traditional blockchain monetization strategies and innovative approaches unique to Arbitrum’s architecture.\n\n**Research Methodology (Overview)**:\n\n\n\n* Analyze successful revenue models from other blockchain networks.\n* Evaluate emerging trends in network monetization.\n* Assess the feasibility of implementing various revenue streams within Arbitrum’s existing framework.\n\n    Final Outcome: A report with supporting data/dashboards to identify and evaluate innovative, sustainable revenue models beyond sequencer fees to ensure Arbitrum’s long-term financial stability and present actionable implementation strategies to the DAO\n\n\n\n### **4. Developer Experience in the Arbitrum Ecosystem: A Comprehensive Analysis of Tooling, Support, and Cross-Chain Infrastructure**\n\n\n\n* The Arbitrum Orbit cluster is rapidly expanding, with over 50 Layer 2 and Layer 3 projects currently being built, making it one of the largest chain clusters today. Arbitrum has also launched its multi-VM smart contract framework, Arbitrum Stylus.\n* As the Orbit cluster grows and Stylus is in place, it’s important to identify infrastructure bottlenecks and challenges developers face.\n* This research will involve interviews with both existing and new builders to:\n    1. Assess the current state of developer tooling on Arbitrum\n    2. Identify support needed from Orbit chain teams for continued growth\n    3. Explore challenges around intra-chain and cross-chain messaging within the Orbit ecosystem\n\n    Final Outcome: An actionable framework to enhance Arbitrum’s developer ecosystem by evaluating current tooling infrastructure, support systems, and competitive positioning through extensive developer interviews and comparative analysis with peer networks.\n\n\n\n# **The Block Research**\n\n**Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative (If applicable):** The Block Research Team, represented by Abraham Eid, Alice Hou\n\n**Telegram Handle (if applicable)**: @Abraham_0000, @alice_hou\n\n**LinkedIn Profile (if applicable)**: Abraham Eid, Alice Hou\n\n**The role being applied for (choose one):** Research Working Member\n\n**Hourly Rate (in USDC):** 500 (for the whole 5-member team)\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nThe Block boasts over 5 years of experience, backed by a team of more than 35 research specialists. They have serviced over 135 clients across Web3, FinTech, VC, and traditional finance sectors, including conducting research for leading ecosystems such as Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon, Solana and Avalanche.\n\nNotable projects led by Block Research include guiding a $2B+ public gaming firm on its Web3 gaming market entry strategy, collaborating with billion-dollar blockchain platforms on competitive benchmarking and development strategies, informing token distribution strategies for prominent Layer 2 protocols, and co-developing institutional-grade crypto index products for top-tier funds requiring resilience in volatile markets.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\nArbitrumDAO stands at a point where refining its governance frameworks and improving its ability to measure community engagement can drive meaningful progress. Our proposed work in the first two months of the six-month term will focus on two key initiatives: exploring complementary governance models and developing a comprehensive community metrics dashboard to evaluate the social adoption of Arbitrum’s various product offerings. These initiatives address the DAO’s current challenges, combining structured research and data tools to support transparency, efficiency, and community engagement.\n\n\n### **Complementary Governance Models**\n\nThe need for scalable and effective governance is clear from past initiatives like the Gaming Catalyst Program, where issues such as lagged operations and limited measurable impact surfaced. To address these challenges, we propose researching, designing, and piloting governance models such as futarchy and quadratic funding.\n\n\n\n* Futarchy: This approach uses prediction markets to align governance decisions with measurable outcomes, ensuring that proposals are evaluated based on their projected success. We will conduct simulations to model how this approach could guide decision-making by analyzing hypothetical scenarios.\n* Quadratic Funding: This model supports fair resource distribution by emphasizing broad participation in grant programs and community initiatives. Our analysis will optimize funding allocations by examining voting behaviors, incentives, and projected impacts.\n\nIn designing these frameworks, we will deliver data-driven insights, including sensitivity analyses to explore how different variables (e.g., voter turnout, proposal costs) influence their effectiveness. Our work will culminate in a detailed proposal for governance experiments tailored to ArbitrumDAO, providing stakeholders with actionable tools to address governance challenges.\n\n\n### **Community Metrics Dashboard**\n\nA vibrant and engaged community is critical for the success of any ecosystem. Developers often assess the community dynamics of an ecosystem when deciding if to build. Similarly, investors and users look for signals that indicate the ecosystem’s health and momentum. However, existing metrics like Twitter & Discord follower counts fall short of capturing the nuanced sentiment and engagement within a community.\n\nWe propose developing a community metrics dashboard that aggregates a wide range of indicators to provide a comprehensive view of ecosystem activity. This framework will allow developers, investors, and users to “test the temperature” of the ecosystem with data-driven insights. The dashboard would track, but not be limited to:\n\n\n\n* Social Media Metrics: Twitter impressions, engagement rates, and Google Trends data to gauge interest and visibility.\n* Sentiment Analysis: Aggregating community opinions from forums, tweets, and developer discussions to understand emotional and social trends.\n* Engagement Metrics: Measuring active participation in Discord, Telegram, and GitHub to assess the vibrancy of the ecosystem.\n\nThis dashboard will not only help developers evaluate which technical stack to build on, but also assist investors in identifying promising projects, and users in understanding the ecosystem’s momentum. The ultimate goal is to establish a robust framework for assessing community sentiment and engagement that can set a new standard for the industry.\n\nThrough these efforts, we aim to provide ArbitrumDAO with structured governance models and a scalable framework for measuring community engagement. Together, these initiatives will help the DAO address its immediate challenges while laying the groundwork for sustained growth and ecosystem vitality.\n\n\n# **Llama Research & Castle Capital ([@dl_research](https://x.com/@dl_research) & [@castle__cap](https://x.com/@castle__cap))**\n\n**Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative**: DefiLlama Research & Castle Capital\n\n**Email Address**: ryan@dlnews.com, atomist@castlecapital.vc (please contact both)\n\n**Telegram Handle**: [@cryptodurs](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/cryptodurs) and [@atomist](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/atomist)\n\n**Role**: Research Working Member\n\n**Hourly Rate (in USDC)**: $100 per hour\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nDefiLlama Research and Castle Capital bring complementary expertise to the table.

[Unifying Arbitrum’s Mission, Vision, Purpose (MVP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-s-mission-vision-purpose-mvp/27275/1).\n\n\n### **1. Exploratory Research on Builder Retention & Expansion (Target = Applications)**\n\nProblem: Builders are not always aware of opportunities within the ecosystem or the possibilities that the tech stack unlocks, and once onboarded have limited support from the DAO.\n\nGoal: Identify and address key challenges in developer retention, ecosystem growth, and strategic alignment to recommend an effective builder expansion strategy.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* Builder Needs Survey & Interviews: Identify pain points of current developers on Arbitrum One and Nova.\n* Developer Segmentation: Profile builders (DeFi, GameFi, infrastructure) for tailored support.\n* Competitive Benchmarking: Assess gaps vs. other layer 2 networks.\n* Strategic Recommendations: Propose clear steps to improve onboarding and incentives.\n\nPost Work Unlock: A clear pathway for an onboarding/ecosystem workstream to be set-up with a clear basis for a strategy to be created and implemented.\n\n\n### **2. Ecosystem-Building Initiatives (Target = DAO-Driven Development Programs)**\n\nProblem: Arbitrum lacks a competitive strategy to reward innovation, limiting its ability to attract and retain top-tier developers critical to its reputation as a home for disruptive builders.\n\nGoal: Position Arbitrum as the premier blockchain for innovation by optimizing grant funding and incentivizing novel protocols.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* RPGF Analysis: Evaluate the impact of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) models in competing ecosystems.\n* Innovation Grants: Propose funding mechanisms to reward long-term, high-impact projects.\n* Grant Prioritization: Identify top Arbitrum-aligned protocols for strategic funding.\n* Builder Engagement: Suggest strategies to strengthen relationships with existing projects.\n\nPost-Work Unlock: A roadmap for a grant-driven growth workstream to attract top builders and drive sustainable ecosystem expansion.\n\n\n### **3. Improving Orbit Chain Experience & Ecosystem Integration (Target = Ecosystem)**\n\nProblem: Orbit chains often feel disconnected from Arbitrum One and other orbits, with fragmented liquidity and suboptimal UX. While full interoperability relies on Offchain Labs, abstracting chain complexities can drive immediate improvements and enhance ecosystem cohesion.\n\nGoal: Address UX gaps, simplify chain abstraction, and align Orbit chains with the broader ecosystem while exploring future technical solutions as they mature.\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n* Non-Technical UX Solutions: Propose immediate improvements to UX, including chain abstraction to streamline user interactions and reduce complexity.\n* Bridge Design Analysis: Compare intent-based bridges across ecosystems and suggest best practices for Arbitrum.\n* Messaging Layer Review: Evaluate existing messaging layer solutions for Orbit chains, focusing on user-centric abstraction of chain communication.\n* Alignment with Ethereum Plans: Analyse how proposed solutions align with Ethereum’s interoperability and chain abstraction strategies.\n\nPost-Work Unlock: Clear recommendations for improving UX and advancing Orbit chain adoption while leveraging chain abstraction for seamless user experiences.\n\nWe also plan to include the following projects in our Scope of Work, which are detailed in ‘Additional Details’ on the forum (i) Arbitrum’s Search for its Identity (ii) New Sector Mapping and Outreach.\n\n\n# **Blockworks Advisory**\n\n\n\n* Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative [If Applicable]:\n    * Blockworks Advisory\n        * Representatives: [EffortCapital](https://x.com/EffortCapital), [magicdhz](https://x.com/magicdhz), [GoldDefi](https://x.com/GoldDefi), [0xMims](https://x.com/0xMims)\n* Email Address:\n    * Blockworks Advisory: advisory@blockworks.co\n* Telegram Handle (if applicable):\n    * Blockworks Advisory representatives:\n        * @effortcapital, @magicdhz, @carolinagold, @Mims0x, @rmalakaib\n* Role being applied for: Research-Oriented Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): $195/hr per individual\n\n\n## **Experience:**\n\nBlockworks has established itself as a premier source of deep technical and protocol-specific research over the past two and a half years. During its participation in ARDC V1, Blockworks played a pivotal role in recovering/saving over 3.7M ARB in misused or unallocated funds for the DAO and Foundation (e.g. Furucombo and Synapse) while also facilitating important discussions around Timeboost.\n\nAdditionally, they developed a comprehensive Arbitrum data dashboard, delivering valuable insights into the platform's on-chain activity and financial metrics. They also support other leading protocols such as the Solana Foundation, Lido, and Ethena among others.\n\n\n## **Proposed Scope of Work for Arbitrum:**\n\n\n### **1. Unified Incentives Framework (Incentive Program Design Assistance)**\n\nThrough our initial ARDC STIP work, Blockworks Advisory is uniquely positioned to assist in the development of the next incentive program scheduled to launch in 2025. Blockworks Advisory could work closely with the Incentives Working Group and other major stakeholders to create a Unified Incentives Framework that applies previous best practices and lessons learned to optimize ROI in various objective functions. While we will not administer the incentives or perform the operations (management, etc) we will help structure the proposal, and the program for the greater good of the ecosystem leveraging research accomplished. As the embargo on incentives ends in Q1, this would likely be our first deliverable, and would span 2 months worth of time in our term. Additionally, we believe this deliverable to be of great value to the DAO, given the DAOs past initiatives, STIP and LTIP, and the likely continuance of incentives post-embargo. The Foundation has also weighed in and has provided incentives as a suggested area of work for the Research member, found here - [https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrum-foundations-recommendations-for-ardc-deliverables/27686).\n\nBelow are other deliverables that we can work on in addition to or besides the Incentive Framework.\n\n\n### **2. Timeboost Revenue Allocation Framework**\n\nWhile Timeboost is an innovative solution coming to Arbitrum that will likely be a positive catalyst for DAO revenue, there hasn’t been a community-wide discussion on how the revenue should be allocated and whether it makes sense for the DAO to capture all proceeds or redistribute it to impacted LPs/protocols.\n\n\n### **3. Orbit Chain Strategy**\n\nProvide the DAO with a path towards aligning the ARB token with the growth of the Orbit tech stack, taking lessons learned from other ecosystems (Cosmos, Polkadot, Optimism, zkSync, etc). Outlining a procurement vs ownership model where we identify what products/services the DAO should own (e.g RaaS, block explorer, data indexing, etc).\n\n\n### **4. General Data Services**\n\nSimilar to the [Multisig Support Service](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-multi-sig-support-service-mss/23737) proposed by Entropy Advisors and R3gen Finance to reduce operational spend and increase proposal efficiency, Blockworks Advisory could become a shared data service provider that any Arbitrum working group or initiative (including the Foundation) could tap into to fulfill all data needs. We have the most [comprehensive](https://x.com/blockworksres/status/1853879698029527453) Arbitrum data in the industry, including DAO financials, and can leverage this to empower the various stakeholders in the community.\n\n\n### **5. Developer-centric Strategy Framework**\n\nIn last year’s [Developer Report from Electric Capital](https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report), Arbitrum saw a troubling decline in active developers in the ecosystem. This deliverable would be outlining the developer pipeline specifically in regards to Arbitrum, and provide suggestions for where DAO funding could possibly aid in the development process.\n\n\n### **6. Financial Audit of Arbitrum Grants Programs**\n\nThe Arbitrum Grants program is expansive, and a financial audit would simply be a retroactive analysis of the Arbitrum Grants program to date to determine ROI for the ecosystem.\n\n\n# **Messari**\n\n\n\n* Name of Applicant & Applicant’s Representative (If applicable): Messari Protocol Services\n* Telegram Handle (if applicable): @ jackpurdy @ alex_barry22\n* LinkedIn Profile (if applicable): [Messari | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/messari/)\n* The role being applied for (choose one): Research Working Member\n* Hourly Rate (in USDC): $145/hour\n\nOur blended hourly rate of $145 reflects the expertise and resources required to deliver exceptional research and insights for the ArbitrumDAO.

This will be used as a project buffer with funds either deployed in support of the program, recycled into ecosystem development or returned to Arbitrum DAO.\n\nSuccessful completion of these deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:\n\n* Number of active developers\n* Dev Github quality\n* Delegate engagement satisfaction\n* Voter participation\n* Capture-resistance\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**\n\n* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops\n* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way\n* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**\n\n* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows\n* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**\n\n* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**\n\n* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success\n* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “we can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs\n\nWithin web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.\n\n### Centralised Grants Program: Problems\n \n![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)\n    \n* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program\n* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.\n* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding\n* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to “open the door” for those who they know or have worked with before.h.\n\n### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems\n\n![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)\n    \n* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.\n* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas…\n* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.\n* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.\n* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.\n* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.\n\n### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds.\n\nAt its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\n![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)\n    \n> 💡The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n* Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n* Domain expertise and knowledge\n* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission\n* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling\n* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism\n* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n\nThis is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\n\nThis is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n![88d617338384427ed53607b929264bc8b623ef43_2_624x281.png](ipfs://bafkreiaylf4ugerhg5c755rx2ffjydpjcri6sx7mohjrafoiuylihkijfy)\n    \n### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.\n\nWeb3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n### Multisig Management\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.\n\n> 💡 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n### Team\n\nPlurality Labs Team\n\n**Disruption Joe**\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million.

In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\n\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.\n\nIf successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1.

While we’ve focused on the core sponsorship package to deliver maximum value, we’ve kept the POAP add-on as a voting option, as we believe it would provide Arbitrum with additional visibility at ETH Bucharest.\n\nSubmitting via Questbook would have been more conventional, but we chose the DAO Events Budget to expedite the resolution, as Questbook would likely only conclude by late February or March, leaving insufficient time for preparation. A prompt decision allows us to finalize event logistics, branding, and hackathon planning in advance.\n\n**Intended Voting Options:**\n\n1. **FOR, with POAP - $69,300**\n2. **FOR, without POAP - $55,800**\n3. **Abstain**\n4. **Against**\n\nWe appreciate the community’s feedback and participation in ensuring Arbitrum’s success at ETH Bucharest 2025!\n\n---\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThe proposal invites Arbitrum DAO to sponsor [ETH Bucharest](https://linktree.com/ethbucharest) 2025, showcasing its Layer 2 ecosystem and Stylus technology while supporting the Hackathon Open Track to drive real-world use cases and foster impactful startups.\n\nThe total investment for this proposal is set at **$ 69,300** *(10% discount included)*.\n\nThis partnership strengthens Arbitrum’s leadership in innovation and community engagement.\n\n\n# **Motivation**\n\n![ETH Bucharest 2024 Vibes](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/0/0cdd8d650abbcd46c8caa3d7b5fc937e2d981f6f_2_1380x604.jpeg)\n\n\nETH Bucharest 2025, taking place from April 2-5, will build upon the success of last year’s conference, which attracted 1,100+ unique attendees and 100+ hackers.\n\nFor 2025, we expect over 1,500 community enthusiasts and 150 hackers, with a diverse range of speakers, tracks, and events dedicated to fostering Ethereum and Web3 innovation in Eastern Europe.\n\nYour continued involvement will be instrumental as we work to create a pivotal gathering for the Ethereum community in this region.\n\nArbitrum has already had a significant impact at ETH Bucharest 2024 (from 27th to the 30th of March 2024), with @ZER8 and @DisruptionJoe making Arbitrum’s presence felt on-site.\n\nThis was the first time Arbitrum DAO had a booth at a conference and\n\nOur collaboration deepened as we hosted the [first ever IRL Arbitrum Workshop and Hackathon, which focused on Stylus](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/final-report-arbitrum-workshop-and-hackathon-in-bucharest-romania/27478)—a groundbreaking technology for fully EVM-compatible smart contracts written in Rust.\n\n![Arbitrum Workshop & Hackathon Vibes](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/a/a930331d7167e762f51a3ac340ed7eab48620a9b_2_1380x920.jpeg)\n\n\nThis initiative [was funded by the Arbitrum Education, Community Growth and Events 2.0](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f30eb1c1eb9145098a15e&chainId=10&role=builder&proposalId=66d6f6612047c84bb8505ed9) with $ 22,524 and was completed in November 2024.\n\nThis workshop and hackathon set the stage for Arbitrum’s next evolution, creating unique momentum in Romania’s fast-growing Ethereum community.\n\n# **Rationale**\n\n**Why ETH Bucharest 2025?**\n\n* **Prime Visibility:** ETH Bucharest is Eastern Europe’s most prominent Ethereum gathering. By partnering, Arbitrum will gain brand exposure across all main stages, hackathon rooms, and throughout the event, ensuring high visibility to developers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts.\n\n* **Community Engagement:** Direct engagement with the next generation of Ethereum builders through workshops, talks, and exclusive networking opportunities. This includes pre-hackathon workshops and dedicated bounty tracks.\n\n* **Early Adopter Appeal:** Be at the forefront of introducing Stylus and Arbitrum’s Layer 2 technology to one of Europe’s largest developer pools. This partnership would position Arbitrum as a leader in Ethereum Layer 2 solutions in Romania, Eastern Europe & beyond (we had participants from the US. Canada, Australia, etc).\n\n* **Network Expansion:** ETH Bucharest attracts over 1,500 attendees, including developers, project leads, investors, and Web3 enthusiasts, offering a valuable opportunity for Arbitrum to expand its ecosystem in a fast-growing region.\n\nETH Bucharest 2025 is your platform to reinforce Arbitrum's leadership in Layer 2 solutions, inspire the next wave of Ethereum builders, and make meaningful connections in the Eastern European Web3 space.\n\nWe would be thrilled to have Arbitrum DAO as one of the main partners, shaping the future of Ethereum in one of its most vibrant hubs.\n\n**Specifications** \n\nWith this proposal, Arbitrum DAO will play a pivotal role at ETH Bucharest 2025, becoming a main partner and significantly enhancing its presence in the Eastern European Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n#### Hackathon Involvement\n\n* Arbitrum will feature its own dedicated bounty tracks, focused on technologies such as Stylus and Layer 2 scaling solutions. These tracks will encourage builders to innovate within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n* Arbitrum will also support the Hackathon Open Track, themed Real World Use Cases. \nThis track prioritizes impactful projects that address societal challenges and incorporates a business plan requirement, ensuring a well-rounded approach to team-building and scalability. By contributing to this track, Arbitrum will attract diverse participants, including non-technical contributors vital to startup success.\n\n#### Conference Partnership\n\n* As one of the main partners, Arbitrum will enjoy central visibility at ETH Bucharest 2025:\n\n  * 25m² exhibition booth at a prime location, allowing for extensive interaction with attendees and showcasing Arbitrum’s technology and ecosystem.\n\n  * 1-hour main stage speaking slot to present Arbitrum's latest advancements, with a focus on Stylus and its contributions to Ethereum scaling.\n\n  * Pre-hackathon workshop, providing a hands-on introduction to Arbitrum’s tech stack, including Stylus, to engage and onboard developers.\n\n#### Enhanced Branding and Engagement\nArbitrum will gain significant visibility through the Arbitrum x POAP Activation, replacing traditional VIP-focused sponsorships with an innovative and inclusive initiative.\n\nAs the exclusive sponsor of the ETH Bucharest POAP Passport, Arbitrum will:\n\n* Showcase the POAPs minted on the Arbitrum Chain, solidifying its leadership in Layer 2 innovation.\n* Drive engagement as attendees collect POAPs at key activities like workshops, panels, and hackathons, all branded with Arbitrum’s identity.\n* Foster community interaction through a gamified experience, encouraging networking and boosting foot traffic to Arbitrum’s activations.\n\nThis activation ensures broad visibility, deep attendee engagement, and a memorable on-chain showcase of Arbitrum’s capabilities.\n\n### **Rationale for Design Decisions**\n\n1. **Hackathon Focus:** Bounty tracks and the Open Track emphasize real-world impact and onboarding multidisciplinary teams, aligning with Arbitrum’s goal of fostering diverse innovation. Previous hackathons, such as the Arbitrum Workshop & Hackathon in Romania, demonstrated high engagement and successful project outcomes, solidifying this approach.\n\n2. **Conference Presence:** The combination of a large booth, main stage slot, and workshop ensures Arbitrum’s technology and ecosystem receive the spotlight they deserve at Eastern Europe’s largest Ethereum event.\n\n   Similar sponsorship models at global events, such as Devcon and ETHGlobal, have proven successful for ecosystem expansion and brand alignment.\n\n3. **POAP Activation: Gamified Networking** \n\n   Sponsoring the ETH Bucharest POAP Passport replaces traditional networking add-ons with an interactive, gamified experience. \n\n   Attendees collect 5-7 POAPs minted on Arbitrum Chain by engaging in event activities, unlocking exclusive prizes or raffle entries upon completion.\n\nPOAP's integration on Arbitrum showcase its scalability and low-cost transactions while fostering memorable interactions with developers, enthusiasts, and thought leaders.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures Arbitrum’s involvement at ETH Bucharest 2025 will maximize its impact, foster community engagement, and reinforce its leadership in Ethereum Layer 2 solutions.\n\n# **Steps to Implement**\n\nGiven the timeline of the event (April 2–5, 2025) and the need to pass the proposal through Arbitrum DAO
