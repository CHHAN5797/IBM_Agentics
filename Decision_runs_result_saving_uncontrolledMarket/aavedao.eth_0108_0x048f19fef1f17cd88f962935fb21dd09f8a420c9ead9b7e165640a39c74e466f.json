The current instance of the GSMs issue GHO into circulating supply and offer no additional revenue beyond the fee for interacting with the GSM. To date, both GSMs have generated a combined 21.9K USD in fees. \n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidxpse554hufcrksjc2you63l3abqnublk4h4cyg6inwdsquvomdy)\n    \nWith only 16M of combined USDC and USDT in the GSMs, the opportunity cost of holding aTokens in the GSM to date is 138.5k for the Aave DAO. However, during more recent times when GHO has been trading above peg and both GSMs have reached there Exposure Caps, the daily opportunity cost in lost yield is ~1.6k, which is equivalent to ~575k when annualised.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifay4gngo2u65tapm7brryjh22qrrt7smxbitkqlj6sjl7ezxrnma)\n    \nThe proposed GSMs will enable funds held within the GSM to earn yield and for this yield to go the DAO's treasury. Due to the enhanced capital efficiency, the USDC Exposure and GHO Bucket Capacity of the GSM can be sized based upon the lesser of the following:\n\n* Preferred amount of USDC exposure; or,\n* Available exit liquidity in the USDC reserve.\n\nEither of the above options, compares favourably when determining GSM parameters relative to configuring the Exposure Capacity for peg stability. If additional capacity is needed, a USDT aToken GSM can be deployed. \n\nThe aToken yield acts as a proxy for Borrow Rate on the Aave v3 market. Meaning GHO Minted from the GSM generates aUSDC yield and GHO Borrowed on Aave v3 generates interest. The aUSDC revenue is available every block as it accrues, unlike the interest accruing from GHO debt which Aave only receives if the user repays their loan.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposed instance of the GSM is intended to replace the existing USDC GSM, will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO and utilizes the USDC surplus to mint aEthUSDC tokens. \n\naEthUSDC is instantly redeemable for USDC within the main Aave v3 deployment on Ethereum. The GSM can mint and burn aEthUSDC in exchange for USDC based upon user demand. \n\nSwap fees will be accumulated in GHO and surplus aEthUSDC will be claimable. A bot will be deployed to periodically claim the revenue to the DAO's treasury. \n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkU3-Tp6R.png)\n\nA detailed specification will be shared during the ARFC phase.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy stataUSDC and stataUSDT GSMs on Ethereum\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2025-01-17\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying two stataToken GSMs using the [ERC4626 implementation](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-stability-module-update/14442/10) developed by Aave Labs to replace the existing USDC and USDT GSMs.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWhile the primary focus of the GSM is to ensure price stability, the current GSMs issue GHO backed 1:1 with USDC and USDT, which are then held unproductively. The opportunity cost of passively holding USDC and USDT increases as the GSM size grows over time.\n\nWith the recent completion of Certora’s ERC4626 GSM audit, there is an opportunity to deploy two new [stataToken](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-statatoken-v3/11894) GSMs to replace the existing GSMs. The USDC and USDT holdings in the current GSMs will be migrated to the new stataUSDC and stataUSDT GSMs, allowing yield generated by these assets to be claimed as revenue by the Aave DAO.\n\nThe yield from stataTokens functions as a proxy Borrow Rate and accrues revenue to the DAO continuously, unlike GHO Borrow Rate interest, which is only realized when users repay loans. The chart below illustrates the native deposit yield for USDC and USDT compared to the GHO Borrow Rate over time.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 14.00.34](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1ezZ9LvJg.png)\n\nBased on current GSM holdings (1.5M USDC and 10.1M USDT) and the 6-month average deposit rates (7.12% for USDC, 5.88% for USDT) on Aave v3 Core, the Aave DAO could generate an estimated $593.8k USD in annual revenue. This figure is indicative and subject to variations in deposits and market conditions.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-01-16 at 12.19.06](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy6BY_IDye.png)\n\nDo note, this proposal supersedes this [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-ausdc-gsm-on-ethereum/19514/2).\n\n### Pricing Strategy\n\nWhile the ERC4626 GSM offers both dynamic and fixed price oracles, the USDC and USDT to GHO ratio will be configured 1:1 to support a quick deployment and reflect the relatively small size of the underlying holdings.\n\n### Debt Ceiling\n\nA potent tool for mitigating adverse effects derived from over-reliance on centralised stablecoins, this parameter can be configured relative to GHO's circulating supply. \n\nEvident earlier this week when USDT traded beneath $1.000 across several venues, users are able to supply the depegged asset to mint GHO. The debt ceiling is the primary means of limiting the GSM exposure to a specific asset. Furthermore, the debt ceiling can be sized based upon the lesser of the following:\n\n* Preferred amount of USDC exposure; or,\n* Available exit liquidity in the USDC reserve.\n\nEither of the above options, compares favourably when determining GSM parameters relative to configuring the Exposure Capacity for peg stability.\n\n# Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThe below provides an overview of the GSM.\n\n![tokenlogic illustration 5|1920x1568](upload://dr8cNG2WeQcJR4btKOb4yIP2UIY.jpeg)\n\n### Existing GSM Migration Overview\n\nThe previous versions of the GSM will be seized, and all liquidity migrated to the new version.\n\nThe below provides an overview of the methodology.\n\n- Deploy new stataUSDC and stataUSDT GSM4626 from the Gho-Core repository with their respective Oracles\n- Add new GSMs to the GSMRegistry\n- Update the FeeStrategy of the new GSMs to the existing FeeStrategy: [`0x83896a35db4519BD8CcBAF5cF86CCA61b5cfb938`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x83896a35db4519BD8CcBAF5cF86CCA61b5cfb938)\n- Grant the Executor the ``'LIQUIDATOR_ROLE'`` to be able to seize the existing GSMs\n- Seize the current USDC and USDT GSMs by calling the `seize()` function.\n  - This freezes actions on them and transfers the underlying tokens to the collector\n- Add the two new GSMs as facilitators on the GHO token contract\n- Add the new stataUSDC and stataUSDT GSMs as controlled facilitators on the GhoBucketSteward\n- With the withdrawn assets above, obtain stataUSDC and stataUSDT via deposit on the respective vaults\n- With the obtained stataUSDC and stataUSDT, exchange for GHO on the new respective GSMs\n- Use the obtained GHO to `burnAfterSeize()` on the current USDC and USDT GSMs. If there are any discrepancies in the amount of GHO, use GHO from the treasury to bring the minted GHO by the GSMs to zero\n- Remove existing GSMs as facilitators of the GHO token\n- Remove existing GSMs from the GSMRegistry\n- Remove existing USDC and USDT GSMs from being a controlled facilitator on the GhoBucketSteward\n\n### New stataUSDC and stataUSDT GSMs Parameter Configuration\n\nThe below details the configuration of the stataUSDC GSM.\n\n| Parameter                | Value  | \n| ------------------------ | :----: | \n| Bucket Capacity (GHO)    | 16.00M |\n| Exposure Capacity (USDC) |  8.00M |\n| Price Strategy           |  1:1   |\n| Freeze Lower Bound       | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound       | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee             |  0.00% |\n| Burn GHO Fee             |  0.20% | \n\nThe below details the configuration of the stataUSDT GSM.\n\n| Parameter                             | Value  | \n| ---------------------------  | :----: | \n| Bucket Capacity (GHO)       | 24.00M |\n| Exposure Capacity (USDT) | 16.00M |\n| Price Strategy                      |  1:1   |\n| Freeze Lower Bound           | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound           | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound       | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound       | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee                      |  0.00% |\n| Burn GHO Fee                     |  0.20% | \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Launch aUSDC GSM on Ethereum\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-10-18\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying a new aUSDC GHO Stability Module (GSM) and migrating USDC from the existing GSM on Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAfter a successful [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb800d3ab766305fd57389101bc475f0220a8bd47699b0f850eec115f31ca22ee), the existing USDC GSM is to be replaced with an aUSDC GSM. Migrating to an aUSDC GSM is expected to improve the overall investment prospects of GHO by introducing a new aToken revenue stream for the DAO. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 19.56.00](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1H0cN3J1g.png)\n\nWith 8M of USDC from the existing GSM deposited into Aave v3, it would represent less than 10% of the available liquidity in the USDC Reserve. With sufficient growth upside remaining for the aUSDC GSM on Ethereum, the DAO can increase the amount of USDC backing GHO. In addition, separate instances of non USDC aToken GSMs can be deployed to diversify GHO's collateral across other reserves on Aave.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-15 at 19.22.47](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByubX43kkx.png)\n\nThe existing GSM implementation has USDC exposure capacity set at 8M units. When combined with another 8M of USDT, this represents over 10% of GHO's supply not generating any revenue for the DAO. The GHO Stewards elected to not pursue increasing the Exposure Capacity of USDC and USDT to encourage new GHO entering circulating supply via the main market. As a result, GHO traded above peg and it tooks several weeks for newly borrowed GHO to enter circulating supply.\n\nWith the introduction of yield generating assets within the GSM, the GHO Stewards are much more likely to increase the Bucket Capacity and Exposure Capacity of the aToken GSMs to support newly minted GHO entering circulating supply. This is expected to enable GHO to grow more freely whilst partially mitigating GHO trading above/bellow peg. In addition, the more capital is accrued there, the better safeguarded from an extended de-peg GHO is. GSM protects deviations on both sides\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below details the configuration of the aUSDC GSM.\n\n| Parameter                | Value  | \n| ------------------------ | :----: | \n| Bucket Capacity (GHO)     | 16.00M |\n| Exposure Capacity (USDC) |  8.00M |\n| Price Strategy           |  1:1   |\n| Freeze Lower Bound       | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound       | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee             |  0.00% |\n| Burn GHO Fee             |  0.20% | \n\nThe Exposure Capacity is to be increased by the GHO Stewards upon successful upgrade/migration.\n\nThe previous version of the USDC GSM is to be disabled and all liquidity migrated to the new version.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

The two GSMs are to be maintained by the GHO Stewards.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe GSM provides stability to the GHO peg by enabling assets to be exchanged within a defined price band. Deploying a GSM on the Arbitrum network enables swaps to be filled without unnecessarily creating an arbitrage opportunity between networks. \n\nWith the LTIPP ARB grant coinciding with GHO being launched on Arbtirum, the Aave DAO can stimulate demand for GHO whilst also restricting the Bridge Facilitator mint cap to encourage users to mint GHO via the GSMs. User will also be able to swap USDC and USDT for GHO via aggregators that have integrated the GSM. This will lead to USDC and USDT being deposited into the GSM.\n\nWith a healthy balance of USDC and USDT in each respective GSM, the Bridge Facilitator cap can be raised more aggressively and a GHO Bucket Cap with Facilitor role can be introduced to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. \n\n# Specification\n\n\nThe below outline the proposed changes to be included in the governance proposal submission.\n\n## Ethereum\n\n### Arbitrum Focused Facilitator\n\n| Parameter  |     Value      | \n|    ---     |     :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units  | \n\n### CCIP Bucket Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|    ---     |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n## Arbitrum\n\n### CCIP Facilitator Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|     ---    |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n### GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the USDC and USDT GSMs that will be updated by the GHO Stewards post launch.\n\n| Parameter                         | Value   | \n| ------------------------             | :----:     | \n| Freeze Lower Bound        | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound        | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee                   | 0.05% |\n| Burn GHO Fee                  | 0.20% | \n| Supply Cap                       | 1.00M  |\n\nAny deviation from the above will be shared in the comments section below prior to the AIP being submited for vote.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy GHO Facilitator\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-10-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes creating a Facilitator entity on Ethereum to support GHO's expansion across several decentralised applications on various networks.\n\nThis proposal also includes the first integration, a 5M GHO deposit into Aave v3 on Arbitrum. Future proposals shall outline how and where GHO shall be deployed. \n\n# Motivation\n\nGHO was successfully launched on Arbitrum July 2nd 2024 with only the CCIP Bridge Facilitator on Arbitrum. Since then, growth has stalled with around 3% of GHO's supply located on Arbitrum.\n\nThis publication proposes creating a new Facilitator entity on Ethereum for the purpose of onboarding newly minted GHO to various applications on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche and other networks as GHO expands. \n\nUsing Aave v3 on Arbitrum as an example, the below provides a high level overview of the flow:\n\n* GHO is Minted on Ethereum;\n* Transferred to Arbitrum via the CCIP bridge; and,\n* GHO is deposited into Aave v3 on Arbitrum.\n\nThe facilitator will enable Aave DAO to onboard new GHO demand vectors while segregating risk from the existing Ethereum facilitator.\n\nThe new facilitator role will have independent minting and bucket capacity constraints specific to supporting each proposed integration.\n\nCollateralization of minted GHO will depend on the different use-cases and takes place on the respective dApp when users bring GHO into the circulating supply.\n\nBeyond an initial 5M of GHO being proposed for deployment into Aave v3 on Arbitrum, other destination(s) for newly Minted GHO are to be presented in separate [TEMP CHECK] proposals for Aave DAO approval. An example, a [TEMP CHECK] would be to Mint GHO to be deposited into a GHO Reserve on Aave v3 Lido instance.\n\n## Aave v3 Arbitrum \n\nAn initial 5M units of GHO be deposited into the existing GHO Reserve on Aave v3 on Arbitrum. The below image shows the overall flow of GHO from Eth to Arb and into Aave v3. \n\n![tokenlogic illustration 2|1920x1042](upload://q2K20iwUi5poiuQ9CUUCDH4qqH1.jpeg)\n\nDepositing 5M of GHO represents a ~22% of the GHO liquidity in the reserve and is expected to dilute the deposit rate and reduce the borrow rate. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-29 at 22.09.07|1650x158](upload://zpzHzakLKAXc3of28V9gFgh4WYO.png)\n\nUsers will then respond and a new equilibrium is found. After monitoring how the market reacts to this change, a separate proposal will detail any additional GHO to be minted and deposited into the reserve.\n\nTo ensure there is sufficient capacity in the GHO reserve, the Risk Stewards will increase the GHO Supply Cap as required to facilitate GHO being deposited.\n\nThe Aave DAO is to be the sole beneficiary of any revenue generated from GHO deposited into Aave. \n\nA separate proposal shall be required to deposit additional GHO into the reserve at a later date. \n\n## Specification \n\nThe below serves as a guide and is to be refined with input from Risk Service Providers during the ARFC stage of the governance process. \n\n| Parameter  |     Value          | \n|    -------     |     :-------:      |\n| Bucket Cap |     50M units  |\n| Mint Cap     |      5M Units   | \n\nThe GHO Stewards are to be responsible for determining when and how much to increase the GHO Mint Capacity and Bucket Capacity whilst using the fast track, Direct-to-AIP, process for implementing the proposed amendments. \n\nThe facilitator on Ethereum can generate and burn GHO tokens up to a certain bucket size. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the ARFC stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
