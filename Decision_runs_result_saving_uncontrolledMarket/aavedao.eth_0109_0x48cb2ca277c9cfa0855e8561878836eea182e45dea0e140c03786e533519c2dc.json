        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Activate and Deploy GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-27\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis proposal aims to establish a dedicated Safety Module for GHO, Aave's native stablecoin, on Arbitrum, to enhance the security and stability of the Aave Protocol.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module (GSM) will be similar to the existing Aave Safety Module (SM), providing an additional layer of protection against shortfall events and incentivizing stakeholders through rewards by using and staking GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nDeploying the GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum aligns with Aave's strategic goals of fostering a secure and scalable environment for its stablecoin. This proposal leverages Arbitrum's technological advantages and financial incentives, setting a solid foundation for GHO's growth and stability.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe [GHO Safety Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635) was created with the aim of mitigating risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events, thereby fortifying the Aave Protocol’s resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversified the Safety Module’s capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nCreating a GHO SM on Arbitrum responds to several factors:\n\n1. Scalability and low fees\n2. Strong Ecosystem and Liquidity injection\n\nCreating a GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum will ensure support and liquidity for GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nTo provide more context, Aave DAO recently received a Long Term Incentive Pilot Program Grant of 750K ARB from Arbitrum DAO, in order to expand GHO into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe funds would be used as follows:\n\n- 375K ARB distributed over a 12-week period amounts to around 1% additional yield to users. While this could be higher, it will be meaningful enough to make ETH and GHO borrows sufficiently attractive to boost TVL and borrow metrics.\n- 375K ARB used for GHO liquidity mining rewards. To target a sufficient size of GHO liquidity on the network, reward rates will need to be similar to mainnet. The GHO Liquidity Committee has used a mix of incentives to keep GHO at peg. We expect that a similar yield will be needed to manage the GHO peg on Arbitrum.\n\nTogether, these two uses of the grant funds should increase TVL and borrowing demand on Arbitrum. Arbitrum will be one of the most attractive networks to borrow on Aave due to the borrowing incentives. It will be the most appealing L2 to borrow and use GHO when it goes cross-chain.\n\nAnother example is the recent approval by Aave DAO of the [GHO Cross-Chain Launch strategy for the GHO](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2a6ffbcff41a5ef98b7542f99b207af9c1e79e61f859d0a62f3bf52d3280877a) stablecoin, the native asset of the Aave Protocol, beginning with the initial expansion to the Arbitrum network. This expansion will utilize the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).\n\n### **Specification**\n\n1. **Deployment of GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum**:\n    - Establish the GHO SM smart contracts on Arbitrum to manage and protect GHO assets.\n    - Integrate Chainlink oracles for accurate and reliable price feeds.\n2. **Incentive Program**:\n    - Utilize ARB incentives to bootstrap GHO liquidity and adoption on Arbitrum.\n    - Implement liquidity mining programs and other yield strategies to attract and retain GHO holders.\n3. **Merit Incentive Program**:\n    - Stakeholders who participate in staking GHO on Arbitrum will be eligible for Merit rewards. The Merit program is designed to incentivize both borrowing and staking GHO. The rewards will enhance user participation and the overall security of the GHO ecosystem on Arbitrum.\n\n### Useful Links:\n\n[**[ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO**](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635)\n\n**[Aave LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a4d8072fce74d8fc069cf0ca33fb6348e3aa66ab6369dd3dbcaaff01f2cebbd)**\n\n**[[Aave] LTIPP Application](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741)**\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nACI is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not being compensated for creating this TEMP CHECK.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.

By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value (USDT) | Proposed Value (USDT) | Current Value (USDC) |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| LTV       | 0%                   | 74%                  | 74%                  |\n| LT        | 0%                   | 76%                  | 76%                  |\n| LB        | 0%                   | 4.5%                 | 4.5%                 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the ARFC Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Avalanche ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Avalanche to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Avalanche.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Avalanche will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Avalanche network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Avalanche.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Avalanche ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Avalanche ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Avalanche, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Avalanche protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Avalanche ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Avalanche ecosystem has [previously signaled](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci) a large commitment to supporting GHO’s launch on the network.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Avalanche |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 4,500,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Avalanche's Proposal on Temp Check: Rollout Plan for Cross-Chain GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

    "summary": "The proposal recommends adjusting risk parameters for Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon by setting LTVs of certain bridged stablecoins to 0% to reduce risk exposure due to rehypothecation risks, while preserving protocol stability and user safety. The timeline voting metrics show a strong, stable early lead for the 'YAE' option. Market impacts indicate a minor price and TVL decline post-vote, likely reflecting risk aversion. Adjacent similar proposals also favored risk mitigation through parameter adjustments and market offboarding. Forum sentiment is predominantly negative towards the Polygon pre-PIP, supporting the proposal's cautious approach. The recommendation aligns with community sentiment to prioritize user safety while maintaining Aave's presence on Polygon.",
    "key_arguments_for": [
      "Bridge vulnerabilities have historically caused significant DeFi losses, justifying risk parameter adjustments.",
      "Adjusting LTV to 0% for bridged stablecoins reduces risk of collateral devaluation and bad debt.",
      "The proposal aligns with proactive risk management precedents in Aave governance, e.g., Fantom after Harmony exploit.",
      "Forum and risk provider consensus supports cautious offboarding and parameter tightening rather than abrupt exit."
