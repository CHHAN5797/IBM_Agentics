        "body": "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings\n\nAuthor: @Dydymoon\n\nDate: 2023-09-26\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Summary\nFollowing the approval of this TEMP CHECK explaining AIP-42 potential impacts, this proposal will evaluate options to update holdings to maintain maximum emission power by acquiring AURA tokens to keep being exposed to the Balancer ecosystem while optimizing the voting power.\n\n# Context\n\nAIP-42 leads to a decorrelation of the incentives amounts generated on veBAL & vlAURA, as veBAL emission power is limited to BAL + base Aura rewards, while vlAURA receives additional AURA rewards allocated by the DAO treasury.\n\nLooking at the vote incentives market a few weeks after the update went live, we can observe that the majority of cost paid per vote decreased on both layers. However, it’s common to still see projects overpaying so it might take more time for the full market to understand these changes.\n\nFor more context, some veBAL holders voted for the GHO gauges over the past two months without receiving bribes, enabling to generate ~ $300k of incentives on GHO gauges.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to propose several options to update the Balancer ecosystem holdings of the DAO by acquiring AURA to increase its maximum emission power.\n\n*Current data (September 30th)*\nAURA price: 0,84$\nveBAL/vlAURA ratio: 0,1598\nveBAL value acquired per 1$ of vlAURA bought: 1,88$.\n\n## Initial Est. veBAL position\n\nAave DAO acquisition of 157K B-80BAL_20WETH was executed on this proposal 2. If the full amount was locked, the weekly emissions value would be ~ $7,7K per week.\n\n## Current DAO holdings\n\nShortly after this proposal 4 was submitted, TokenLogic submitted two proposals: a first time sensitive one to acquire 443k AURA OTC from Olympus DAO with DAI 1, executed on this AIP, and another to sell the corresponding value in BPT for GHO 2, approved on the following TEMP CHECK.\n\nThe table below shows the Olympus OTC deal data & impact on Aave treasury once executed using current GHO & BPT prices.\n\nIf the DAO was to lock its remaining BPT & AURA holdings now, the weekly emissions value generated would be ~ $10,8K / week.\n\n## Improvement scenarios\n\nWhile an increase can be observed (7,7k to10,8k/week), the maximum emissions can still be improved, either by optimizing or increasing and diversifying the exposure. The tables below show an emission power overview post AIP-42 for both cases.\n\nThe current situation would also require to vote on both layers, which complexifies the management, however this option will be possible as Llama’s SAM contract upgrade ARFC to support both veBAL & vlAURA, and propose to grant the asset manager role to the committee will be published in the coming days (code currently in review by BGD).\n\nAs described in both options above, the goal of this ARFC is to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA units, either with BPT or with stables. The Option 3 proposed in the comments aims to find a compromise for all stakeholders by acquiring ~ 950K AURA units and staking BPT holdings.\n\n### 1) Convert to remaining BPT to AURA\n\nThis option considers optimizing the current holding by selling the remaining BPT for AURA, which will improve the gauge power owned without spending more funds to increase the exposure value.\n\nDespite proposing to convert BPT, Balancer remains a strategic partner and this acquisition will actually enable the DAO to grow more liquidity on Balancer, and partially support the SM strategy once live, creating an important amount of bribes for veBAL holders.\n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA, the weekly emissions value would currently be ~ $20,1K / week (almost twice the current situation including votes on both layers).\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Maximal emission power (Full vlAURA)\n- No extra investment (BPT conversion)\n- Simple management (Vote on one layer only)\n- Less locking restrictions (No decay & 4 months lock)\n- Will enable to grow more liqudity on Balancer\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Sell BPT acquired to lock veBAL according to the partnership (limited price impact)\n- Can be considered as unfair for veBAL holders who supported GHO at launch\n- Balancer DAO might sell the AAVE acquired during the TokenSwap\n\n### 2) Keep remaining BPT & acquire AURA to lock both\n\nAfter receiving some feedback including concerns about selling BPT (initially acquired before AIP-42 at the Balancer partnership to lock for veBAL), this option considers to retain the BPT for veBAL and acquire additional ~ 1,3M AURA to lock for vlAURA with stables from the treasury which increases both the emission power & the exposure value.\n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA with stables and lock the remaining BPT holdings, the weekly emissions value generated would be ~ $25,7K / week.\n\nWhile this improves weekly emissions by $5,6K, this strategy is less efficient compared to the above as it would complexify the management with the need to vote on both layers (one on-chain, one off-chain), relock the veBAL holdings, manage the two voting periods (weeks/rounds), and cost an extra $1M in stables from the DAO treasury.\n\n#### Pros:\n- Increased overall emission power of the Aave DAO (veBAL + vlAURA)\n- Favor good relations with Balancer by following the initial partnership proposal.\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- $1M extra investment (AURA acquisition with stables)\n- More complex management (Vote on two different layers)\n- Includes veBAL restrictions (Voting power decay & up to 1 year lock)\n- Emission power not fully optimized\n\n*(Despite its maximal estimated efficiency, there isn’t an option to convert both BPT holdings + $1M for AURA as this amount would be complex to acquire with the current liquidity available)*\n\n### 3) Mint auraBAL & use BAL, use USDC/AAVE rewards for bribes & lock AURA rewards + Acquire $800K of AURA\n\nThis was initially suggested by Karpatkey in the comments, and updated to this revised option which aims to find a good compromise for all stakeholders.  \n\nThe major update is the consideration of the classic auraBAL staking to allocate BPT instead of converting it to AURA. This strategy earns 18% APR in BAL + AUR, which can be used to create bribes & compensate for the reduced acquisition. \n\nAURA can be accumulated to be locked for vlAURA, and the amount can be replaced with USDC/AAVE to maintain the rewards value which will be used for bribes with the BAL. \n\nThis also reduces the AURA market buy from $1M stables (in Option 1 & 2) to 800K$ in the Option 3: \n- $400K on market (400K USDC) \n- $200K token swap with the Aura DAO (2950 AAVE)\n- $200K OTC Deal with AEF & Contributors (200K USDC)\n\n* Emission power with vlAURA to be acquired: \n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 950K AURA as described above, in addition to 440K acquired from Olympus, the weekly emissions value would be ~ $16,2K / week.\n\n* Emission power with auraBAL staking rewards used for bribes: \n\nIf the DAO was to stake all the auraBAL minted with BPT in the classic staking, the weekly rewards would be ~ $5,4K / week. Assuming a weekly vlAURA bribe cost of $0,007 / week,  ~ $8,9K / week can be obtained in emissions. \n\nOption 3 Total weekly emissions: $16,2K + $8,9K =  $25,2K / week\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Mint & stake auraBAL instead of selling BPTs\n- Very good emission power (vlAURA votes & bribes)\n- Simple management (Vote & bribe on one layer only)\n- Less locking restrictions (No veBAL decay & 4 months lock)\n- Reduce AURA amount to acquire on market ($400K vs $1,1M)\n- AURA long term accumulation (rewards replaced for bribes)\n- Increase veBAL/vlAURA ratio\n- 1,4M vlAURA locked & 157k BPT staked ( good for Aura)\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Complexify the strategy implementation (where to stake auraBAL to be defined)\n- Complexify rewards management (AURA to be lock, BAL + equiv USDC for bribes)\n- Requires a $800K extra investment (including $200K in AAVE & $600K in USDC)\n- Low liquidity & trading volume on auraBAL\n\nIn terms of emission value, the revised Option 3 proposed is similar to Option 2, which was the highest amount proposed ($25,7K vs $25,2K weekly).\n\n# Acquisition details\n\nRegardless of which option above is voted on the ARFC, the proposal is to acquire AURA with USDC on market to reduce the price impact. If anyone reading this is interested in selling AURA OTC, feel free to comment.\n\nSome Aura contributors & the Aura Ecosystem Fund Committee proposed a 200k AURA OTC deal for USDC (available on September 29th), using a TWAP price from the ARFC forum (posted on September 26th with Snapshot vote starting on September 29th) until snapshot vote ended if approved (October 4th).\n\nOverview of the AEF deal using the current AURA price to facilitate estimations but may vary depending on the TWAP price:\n\nThe optimal way to execute these market transactions seems to be using the TWAP orders from Cowswap to split the trades into several orders.\n\nWhile the price impact of selling the remaining BPT for USDC in one transaction is limited (3,5%), this can be reduced to 2,2% with a split of 5 orders. For AURA, the price impact if acquired in one transaction is quite important (42%), but this can also be reduced to 5,7% with a split of 10 orders.\n\n# Specifications\n\nOTC acquisition: If the Aura contributors & AEF deal is approved, the 200k OTC can be implemented using a similar contract to the one used for the Olympus deal (only difference being the price defined with a TWAP). This AIP execution should fall under ACI’s Skyward program scope.\n\nMarket acquisition: As AURA are likely to be mostly bought on market using TWAP orders which can be used with a Safe, the AURA buy and potential BPT sell can be executed by the GHO liquidity committee using the multisig once live (require a fallback handler on it). \n\nThis should simplify the acquisition compared to creating new contracts for this purpose. More information on TWAP orders can be found here.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf Option 1:\n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for AEF OTC deal\n- (AIP) Transfer all BPT from the collector to the committee multisig\n- Committee start TWAP orders BPT for USDC\n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer back USDC equivalent for OTC deal on the Collector\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\nIf Option 2:\n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for Aura deal\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to the committee multisig\n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\nIf Option 3: \n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for AEF deal\n- (AIP) Transfer AAVE from the ecosystem reserve to tokenswap contract for Aura deal\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to the committee multisig for market buy \n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\n## Voting Options TLDR \n\n- YAE (Option 1): Convert BPT for AURA to lock vlAURA \n- YAE (Option 2): Lock BPT for veBAL + buy AURA ($1M in USDC) to lock vlAURA\n- YAE (Option 3): Mint auraBAL with BPT & use rewards for bribes + buy AURA ($800k in USDC & AAVE) to lock vlAURA \n- NAY: Do nothing \n- ABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\nThis ARFC can be useful to pending proposals from SPs but is published on my own initiative and is not receiving any compensation.

        "body": "---\n\n[ARFC] Deploy BAL & aBAL from the Collector Contract\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham) and @dydymoon\nCreated: 2023-02-05 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents two options for deploying the approximately 100k BAL tokens being acquired by AIP 115 and the aBAL holding in the Ethereum Collector Contract, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nAIP 115 has been successfully implemented and Aave has acquired an additional 100k BAL on market. The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].\n\nAave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.\n\nOption 1) Locking veBAL.\nOption 2) Staking auraBAL.\n\nOption 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).\n\nA Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.\n\nAave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:\n\n* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].\n* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].\n* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].\n\nThis proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.\n\n## Option 1) Locking veBAL\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nIn Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.\n\n### What’s veBAL ?\n\nveBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc\n\n* **Gauge-weight Power**\nVoting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.\n\n* **Governance Power**\nVoting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.\n\n* **veBoost**\nLocking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.\n\n* **Protocol Fees**\n75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].\n\n### veBAL Position Overview\n\nBy maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].\n\nWith 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).\n\nBAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.\n\nAave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies\n* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n\nThe boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.\n\nThere remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].\n\n### veBAL yield overview\n\nThe veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:\n\n* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)\n* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)\n* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold\n\nIn the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week\n\nveBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92\n\n* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.\n\nIt’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.\n\n## Option 2) Staking auraBAL\n\nOption 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.\n\nAfter the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].\n\nDepositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.\n\nThe yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.\n\n* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.\n* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).\n* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.\n\nGrowing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.\n\nWith 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.\n\nBy staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].\n\nOption 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.\n\n## Comments\n\nTo help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.\n\nThere are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nTo summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|\n|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|\n|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|\n\nThe amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at\n\nLlama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:\n\n1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH\n2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap\n3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.\n![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)\nThe BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL\n4. Approve BAL on Cowswap\n5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH\n\n![|312x312](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NyamWu2oOW0-UTQrXfcgD2kR4Z6J64pqWmD2kFrcZd_8Ay-MrXsGlGtIXnKSbhcHjzvfFFMtGTc_Hlpuel5Qp0j8GevSPNkqB9AkPN5LZhQLmAW-c8jYmESZPCkEI4QkSc8QaOhdFarIytRV6uq2QNA)\n\nAave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.\n\nAt the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70\n$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56\n\nIn performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).\n\nThe number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.\n\n\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.\n\nThose considerations are:\n\n* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade\n* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]\n* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmVqWgpRmoEvvhvXZFepmAgYU5ZK9XpSs39MExEUpiJZw3\n[3] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484/19\n[5] https://dune.com/queries/782195/1395498\n[6] https://app.warden.vote/dashboard/\n[7] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ac1109d58b02b5b74f10d92fb816a9cdc4b198fd455cc2bb2fdbb52ae84f9e\n[8] https://etherscan.io/token/0x616e8BfA43F920657B3497DBf40D6b1A02D4608d?a=0x5e5ea2048475854a5702f5b8468a51ba1296efcc\n[9] https://dev.balancer.fi/resources/deploy-pools-from-factory/creation/aavelinearpool\n[10] https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n[11] https://app.aura.finance/#/lock\n[12] https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249\n[13] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [13].",

The DAO used the BAL to buy B-80BAL-20WETH LP tokens, that would be locked for veBAL. This position was meant to be used for its emission power, enabling rewards redirection on AAVE & GHO gauges.\n\nThis estimated veBAL position & market metrics at the time were taken into account for the SM upgrade proposals (which includes migrating the current LPs to Balancer V2, implement new categories & slashing parameters, define the smBPT gauges, updates incentives management, create a strategic asset management framework, and further considerations.)\n\nConsidering that veBAL was likely to be needed before the SM upgrade implementation, Llama introduced the StrategicAssetsManager contract, creating a base framework to manage assets from Goverance or with a committee. The TEMP check vote ended mid July, and the contract was submitted to BGD for review after.\n\nFrom Llama’s side, the code supporting veBAL position is already implemented via the StrategicAssetManager contract and can be deployed pending community feedback. However, an external proposal from Aura drastically impacted the veBAL strategy early August.\n\n# Motivation\nOn July 28th, a proposal (AIP-42) was submitted 4 on the Aura governance forum, with the goal of improving $AURA distribution efficiency especially on L2s and alignment of parties receiving Aura rewards.\n\nWhile there are benefits for Aura and vlAURA holders, this proposal also directly impacts veBAL holders in several ways, which is why the Aave DAO should be aware of it.\n\nThe proposal (approved on August 6th) considerably impacts the $AURA emissions by reducing the base distribution by 60%, which is compensated by $AURA distributed from the treasury, but only to vlAURA voters according to their voting weight on gauges.\n\nAs a reminder, there are min & max APR on Balancer, depending on veBAL holdings/boost acquired, while Aura is using its share of the veBAL supply to boost LPs & add AURA rewards in return of a fee on BAL rewards, making it more efficient for most LPs to deposit.\n\nFor this reason, the value of incentives generated per 1$ of bribes can take into account BAL + AURA emissions, which was equivalent before AIP-42 (i.e you’d get the same emission power by farming on Aura & voting with veBAL or with vlAURA)\n\n*Post AIP-42 this changes, because:*\n\n* veBAL emission power is limited to BAL + base Aura rewards (reduced by 60%)\n* vlAURA emission power is increased with BAL + base AURA + additional AURA rewards from Treasury\n\nAura will keep boosting LPs with its veBAL share, and should keep a higher APR than Balancer for depositors.\n\nConsidering that emissions changes took effect on August 24th on Aura, it’s still early to draw conclusions and it might take time for the market to react & adapt. While some changes can already be observed, it might take at least 1-2 extra rounds (2-4 weeks) for the market to normalize.\n\n## Potential impacts of AIP-42 related to Aave utilization:\n\n### veBAL emission power reduced:\n\nAs only vlAURA can redirect extra rewards from the treasury, 1 veBAL will have less emission power than the equivalent vote in vlAURA.\n\n### veBAL holders migration to vlAURA:\n\nAssuming that veBAL holders are considering to switch to vlAURA, it could have several sub impacts:\n\n* veBAL holders choosing to let their position decay to exit (increased BAL emission per veBAL: temporary if ppl then migrate to auraBAL or another wrapper effectively relocking veBAL, but not if assets are sold for AURA and locked.)\n\n* If veBAL holders sell their BPT for AURA on market, the AURA price would increase because of the limited liquidity. It could also impact BAL price and B-80BAL-20WETH liquidity.\n\n* If the veBAL accumulation by Aura protocol is not following this potential migration, it would lead to a dilution of the veBAL underlying vote per vlAURA (a small decrease was already visible over the past days, to 0,1587 veBAL/vlAURA currently)\n\n### veBAL/vlAURA bribe cost update by the market:\n\nSome changes are already visible on bribe marketplaces, but we should expect more updates to happen in the coming weeks: Since veBAL has less emission power, the bribe cost should also decrease. On the other side, since the overall AURA emission is lower, so the bribe cost also seem to decrease, but the value / veBAL vote should increase, creating a decorrelation in the pricing depending on which asset is bribed. Another aspect to take in consideration post AIP-42 is the proportion of vlAURA votes / total votes bribed.\n\nBefore Aura proposal, the emissions were equivalent, but now, whether the split is 20% veBAL 80% vlAURA or the opposite considerably changes the results, so it’s most likely to see vlAURA bribed first.\n\n### Pros of switching to vlAURA:\n\n* Max emission power on DAO owned strategic assets\n* 4 months lock (compared to veBAL lock time is 1 year)\n* No decay on vlAURA, meaning no need to relock weekly\n* Voting are calculated in round (2 weeks) so less votes to cast\n\n### Cons of switching to vlAURA:\n\n* Liquidity is small so it can be an issue if Aave DAO wants to acquire AURA on market but OTC deals can be considered\n* Risk of efficiency reduction if the Aura protocol BAL accumulation doesn’t follow the vlAURA supply increase.\n* No veBoost on vlAURA (but Aura deposits are boosted with their veBAL share)\n\nvlAURA allows for more agile management. Considering that Aave DAO voted to lock veBAL but didn’t lock it yet, it makes sense to consider an update of the strategic assets allocation.\n\n# Other Considerations:\n\n* Long-standing strategic relationship between Aave and Balancer\n* Cost of selling B-80BAL-20WETH BPT\n* Cost of acquiring vlAURA via OTC deals\n* Understanding any potential security and ecosystem risks involved\n* Dev resources to add vlAURA support to current StrategicAssetManager\n* Review time by BGD of the vlAURA implementation\n\n# Specifications:\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to consider an update of the Balancer ecosystem holdings (B-80BAL-20WETH) for an alternative solution. This would mean dedicating part (or all) of the current B-80BAL-20WETH holdings to acquiring vlAURA in order to retain the max emission capacity of the voting power held by the DAO.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, ARFCs will be published:\n\n* To add vlAURA support to the StrategicAssetManager contract (Llama)\n* To share options considered for AURA tokens acquisition (TokenLogic)\n\n# Disclaimer:\nCurrently contributing to TokenLogic & Llama as a strategist, I participated in the Llama proposals mentioned above and am currently working on SM strategy, as well as on the GHO liquidity strategy with TokenLogic.\n\nThe analysis can be useful for both purposes above but is published on my own initiative, so this proposal is not requesting compensation from any third party. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared to facilitate understanding & community discussion.\n\n# Next Steps:\nTEMP CHECK: Gather community feedback and sentiment towards the proposal of updating Balancer ecosystem holdings for a more efficient solution with the following voting options:\n\n- YAE (Update the strategy)\n- NAY (Use veBAL as intially voted)\n- ABSTAIN\n\nARFCs: If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\nAIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",

However, in line with the [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655), the DAO’s veBAL holding should be used to support the three primary pools.\n\nIn addition to Aave DAO’s veBAL holding, several veBAL & vlAURA holders have expressed an intention to help bootstrap GHO liquidity pools. We would like to give a special thank you to the Balancer and Aura community members for their contributions.\n\nThis proposal will try to estimate the gauge power allocated to GHO pools & the potential yield depending on several TVL estimations for each primary pool. In analyzing the potential liquidity conditions, three scenarios are presented.\n\n![|637x109](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/A5xYXlMR_mzanGEWrFjaSNbkao9Zykhi7yKDs2SIMrM_a-mfm9qfsVuX3cmllOazmUkJ-2ewKzf_OKcQ7KOk3UI3UKhiGNrM4L_bW50VDz8Zi9WByYPVVwDRUJU6hclu64kZ96cjz-jFzs2eZnQO7ss)\n\nWhile the initial GHO supply is expected to be 100M, additional cap increases can be implemented and voted so this can also help to visualize how the supported voting power can scale.\n\nFor the purpose of this proposal, it has been assumed that all relevant positions are continuously relocked to maximize the voting rights.\n\nAave DAO is contributing 1.81% of the ~ 7,7% veBAL and the remainder is coming from teams that TokenLogic has been coordinating with. Do note, there are dependencies on these contributors to maintain the voting support over time. Initial discussions indicate that in 2-3 months time, some veBAL and vlAURA holders are expected to revisit there allocations.\n\n## Estimated veBAL gauge power to bootstrap GHO at launch\n\nThe below table presents the initial veBAL and vlAURA expected to support GHO’s launch and Aave DAO’s veBAL holding. Aave DAO holds 157,169.86 B-80BAL-20WETH to be converted to an estimated 1.80% of veBAL supply by [Llama.](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-introducing-strategicassetmanager/13916) The table below shows the distribution of veBAL and vlAURA support for the main three GHO pools.\n\n![|660x69](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5lG1ZsmoHS7KZQGqh61NWikdaq6PbYDnsi2_VcZq1Il4nyF6GenO8_fDM7TACCqXWDDGZBPz5hLZrVYqpS7dgNDXcTQ96pG2MgnWISFhCTLYeAKR6ZNltmYDkr3Gep4BrImZHISaXaipuOoGuBeOEVo)Aave DAO with support from friends is expected to support GHO with 5.5% of veBAL later this week and 7.7% upon Aave DAO converting its B-80BAL-20WETH to veBAL. Subject to timing, some veBAL support from friends may taper when Aave DAO starts voting.\n\n## Estimations of BAL emissions & AURA rewards\n\nThe following estimations are based on vlAURA voting rounds & votes amount, but converted from the actual veBAL equivalent amount of support: 1 vlAURA = 0,1726 veBAL votes.\n\nWe propose Aave DAO split the veBAL voting weight as per below.\n\n* 40% used to vote on the GHO/bb-a-USD V3 pool\n* 40% used to vote on the GHO/LUSD pool\n* 20% used to vote on the 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool\n\nDo note, the voting weight can be changed periodically with each successive gauge vote.\n\n## 1) Aave DAO\n\nThe split proposed below is open for discussion in the comments section. However, later sections show the significance of Aave Friends voting support. We encourage the veBAL and vlAURA support to be view holistically and not just through the lens of Aave DAO’s holding.\n\n![|711x49](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ya2Y1vJVK1Fg3d2gvoREbTGvfYZZQiUa0bhq4OJu0bqnkAyMJSAcXkteAlKQWotthRJAm_8FKZHoII_OMsn9KQmMAaF-v3oNHhB1-V4rhJUEUu3ub2JrRNLPfjjkrELLK6SyDF5r7URWAXSrnGpZi0U)\n\nRewards breakdown for the Aave DAO after the B-80BAL-20WETH is converted to veBAL holding:\n\n![|660x137](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SG0AU1D4fWBjPK6FRSNQ8NVll-IvKk5ZwzTBs61iJYLa8WCbqhj7pABmiJFetg7yQn5x-r7PgqH03cC4UddgYSpskltJBOpS6Z5EYD2Y4NR1yp8qJLUiU2sAIcoAGS_FThOnXItmUtuam5htDH2kWpo)\n\nFor the three TVL scenarios being considered, the following APRs are estimated:\n\n![|660x97](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zi02UdPUDy1BYSeg_N8qZ0SNxkjTsj9zMgQKyP8dlPW5VwBYLv1beBtVeS1Ub1KGTpRorGrVEdp8tzU51YPWnVqDS7Fog_I7fUAdkbqy-pGyzS-dxRU-IO4_MQ0S96EeeEH1SpEErqNyKZDhi53PpEM)\n\nNaturally, TokenLogic will work with the Balancer community to redirect Balancer protocol fee funded vote incentives to preferential pools. More details can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-reallocate-bb-a-usd-protocol-fees-to-gho-bb-a-usd-fees/4969).\n\n## 2) Friends of Aave DAO (excl.

Once the above items are executed, the shortExecutor will implement the above gauge weight votes via the Strategic Asset Manager contract being deployed by Llama.\n\nAlternatively, a Treasury Committee can be created and assigned the AssetManager role enabling the votes to be implemented.\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nWhen presenting the analysis, there are several assumptions that affect the accuracy of the model over time. The most notable variables are mentioned below:\n\n* TVL in the pools\n* Duration of Aave Friends support\n* Frequency of re-locks (maximizing the veBAL voting rights)\n* Vote allocation\n* Aura Boost\n\nTo reduce this dependency on external parties, TokenLogic will publish three proposals in the near future:\n\n* Initiate Protocol Owned Liquidity (leading to increased strategic assets accumulation)\n* Create Treasury Committee\n* Initial GHO Liquidity Incentives Budget\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n@TokenLogic currently receives funding from the Butter Delegate Campaign and is a contributor @Llamaxyz.

The final proposal will reflect the discussion on the governance forum.\n\naip: TBA\ntitle: ARC - Continue Liquidity Mining Program on Aave V2 Ethereum market and Initiate Liquidity Mining on Aave ARC market\nstatus: Proposal\nauthor: @MatthewGraham, @3SE_Holdings, @4lex.eth\ncreated: 03.02.2022\nDiscussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-aave-v2-ethereum-market-and-aave-arc-market/7189\n\n----\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.\n\nIn addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.\n\n# Abstract\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.\n\n* [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): [2,200 stkAAVE per day](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH): 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n\nContinuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\nThe incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.\n\nIn addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:\n\n1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)\n2. Increase liquidity\n3. Attractive (low) borrow rates\n4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor\n5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform\n\nWithin this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.\n\nKey changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:\n\n* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market\n* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/d/d2ff417f056b6dd50b32d389b8167c92d86a39d4_2_1380x984.png \"Chart\")\nNote: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.\n\nOption 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives. Ie: 10% of (1,540-1,078)\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/6/6bdf8f04d85d9e5f50ffe2ac1c50c278a4865a46_2_1380x248.png \"Chart\")\n\nOption 2) Similar methodology to the above with an assumed market size of $250M and distribution across the assets of 60% USDC, 20% ETH and 10% of both wBTC and AAVE.\n\nAsset Value Deposited Multiplier Daily stkAAVE Incentive LM Allocation (%) LM Incentive Split (%) LM vAPR (%)\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/f/fbfed436c63b075741117d4c19a49510745aade6_2_1380x250.png \"Chart\")\n\nMathematics: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.\n\nAarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.\n\nAave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)\n\nWith the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.\n\nWith the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.\n\n## Economics\n\n* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.\n* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.\n* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.\n* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.\n* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives\n* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.\n\nFurther details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community.
