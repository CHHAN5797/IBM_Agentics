As most Balancer community members know, rocket pool and lido have become pillars of the ecosystem through the use of the metastable / composable stable pool types to leverage their yield bearing assets. Staked frax eth will be joining these two juggernauts to facilitate trading and LPing amongst these diverse staking strategies of ETH. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> (sfrxETH) Link to:\n> • [Website ](https://app.frax.finance/)\n> • [Documentation ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens)\n> • [Communities](https://facts.frax.finance/frxeth/validators)\n> (wstETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://stake.lido.fi/)\n> • [Documentation](https://blog.lido.fi/)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/lidofinance)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao)\n> (rETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n> • [Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)\n> • [Github Page](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/usage/contracts/contracts.html#introduction)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sfrxETH is a Frax’s staked wrapped ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido, and rETH is the staked ETH token for Rocket Pool.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/397\n\n**Summary:**\n\n> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory and contains three unique staked ethereum tokens, coinbase eth (cbETH), wrapped staked eth from Lido (wstETH), and rocket eth from Rocket pool (rETH). As most Balancer community members know, rocket pool and lido have become pillars of the ecosystem through the use of the metastable / composable stable pool types to leverage their yield bearing assets. Staked coinbase eth has been prevalent on mainnet as a supporting role for LSDs and will be joining these two juggernauts to facilitate trading and LPing amongst these diverse staking strategies of ETH. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> (cbETH) Link to:\n>* [Website ](https://www.coinbase.com/price/coinbase-wrapped-staked-eth)\n>* [Documentation ](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper)\n>* [Github Page ](https://github.com/coinbase/wrapped-tokens-os)\n>* [Communities](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseAssets)\n\n> (wstETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://stake.lido.fi/)\n> • [Documentation](https://blog.lido.fi/)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/lidofinance)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao)\n\n> (rETH) Link to:\n> • [Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n> • [Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)\n> • [Github Page](https://docs.rocketpool.net/developers/usage/contracts/contracts.html#introduction)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> cbETH is a Coinbase's staked wrapped ETH token, wstETH is a wrapped staked ETH token for Lido, and rETH is the staked ETH token for Rocket Pool.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer is clearly pushing forward on all networks with staked assets as a key focus. By diversifying the protocols which supply staked assets Balancer opens up the door to liquidity providers to gain exposure to multiple providers, while facilitating trade routes for these assets. The protocol benefits greatly from yield bearing assets, and Balancer’s users do just as much. This pool will be a unique and diverse group of Ethereum assets making it exciting for everyone involved.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** Find more information about governance on each projects forum. [cbETH whitepaper](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper), [wstETH](https://research.lido.fi/)., [rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-2-e0d346911fe1)\n2. **Oracles:** See each rate provider contract linked here respectively [cbeth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf017fcb346a1885194689ba23eff2fe6fa5c483b), [wstETH ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768), [rETH ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a8F81c256aee9C640e14bB0453ce247ea0DFE6F)\n3. **Audits:** See [cbETH ](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/coinbase-liquid-staking-token-audit/) , [wstETH](https://github.com/lidofinance/audits), [rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-4-2635c44e4f7e).\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Rocket Pool is a [protocol for decentralized and trustless ETH2 staking](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd). For Lido and wstETH please read [here ](https://lido.fi/faq). Lastly cbETH is from Coinbase and therefore inherently has centralization risks, read the custodial risk section of the whitepaper [here](https://www.coinbase.com/cbeth/whitepaper)\n5. **Market History:** See [rETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth) , [wstETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wrapped-steth) , and [cbETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coinbase-wrapped-staked-eth)\n6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on all assets in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.\n\nLink to pool: [0x4a2F6Ae7F3e5D715689530873ec35593Dc28951B](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4a2f6ae7f3e5d715689530873ec35593dc28951b)\nLink to gauge: [0x56c0626E6E3931af90EbB679A321225180d4b32B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x56c0626E6E3931af90EbB679A321225180d4b32B)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x2Cb5EB92314bf3BFE7977e059A72A806d353fd21`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

Spectra’s Yield Token and Principal Token, minted on top of ERC-4626 interest-bearing tokens, are core protocol primitives. Spectra separates the right to principal from future yield via a process called yield tokenization. This process unlocks new financial possibilities beyond standalone interest-bearing tokens. Anyone can create new markets at will, swap yield derivatives, or become a liquidity provider. Spectra's native token, [APW](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spectra-2), powers it's flywheel tokenomics. Holders can lock APW into veAPW and use it to vote on LM, receive bribes and vote on governance proposals.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Spectra only has one primary source of liquidity and that is Balancer's APW <> ETH pool. We plan to deepen this relationship with tokenisation of Balancer Pool Tokens and veBAL liquid wrappers.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Spectra is a decentralized, community-governed protocol by the APW token holders. They can discuss, propose and vote on upgrades. Any APW holder can lock their tokens to convert into veAPW. More info on Spectra's governance can be found [here](https://app.spectra.finance/governance).\n\n2. **Oracles:** Spectra does rely on price oracles to determine price data\n\n3. **Audits:** [Audit Info](https://docs.spectra.finance/security/audits)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** None\n\n5. **Market History:** The APW/ETH pool was created approx. 7 days ago (29th of June, 2024). APW has been on the market since 18 May 2021, in that time it has not experienced sever volatility. Link to [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spectra-2), [Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x093254005743b7af89e24f645730ba2dd8441333) and [Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2fa29bbfd19314b3faf170dc7826ef69372203a6).\n \n6. **Value:** This is expected to be the primary pool for this token. APW liquidity mining started a couple weeks ago so users are expected to be either trading out of APW, locking it for governance or trading it into the liquid version of veAPW.\n\n**Technical Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x2fa29bbfd19314b3faf170dc7826ef69372203a6`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.\n> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implements the agreed-upon changes to the platform.

The full audit report may be found below:\n> [Ethereum Liquid Staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/eth/overview/#audit-details)\n> 4. **Centralization vectors:** Centralisation Vectors: The Ankr 2.0 whitepaper introduced the vision for Ankr Network as a decentralized system where independent node operators work alongside Ankr nodes to power the growth and development of Web3.
