        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Funding Update\nauthor: \n@TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @scottincrypto \n@r3genFinance - @Elliott_r3gen, @Pepperoni_Jo3_r3gen\ncreated: 2023-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Create and Fund GHO Liquidity Committee\nAuthor: @TokenLogic\nDated: 2023-09-08\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents Aave DAO the opportunity to create and fund the GHO Liquidity Committee for an initial 3 month duration.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the coming weeks, we expect the voting base to reallocate gauge votes away from GHO liquidity pools. This is largely due to those voting for GHO pools incurring an opportunity cost by not participating in the bribe market.\n\nIf the Aave DAO was to lock all of its BPT for veBAL, the gauge vote is equivalent to 1.8% of veBAL. Even with some voters continuing to support GHO, a good portion of the 7.7% will move to other pools. There is also the impact of [AIP-42](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682) for the DAO to consider. Voting support from external teams is expected to taper beyond what Aave DAO can replace with its own strategic assets. Furthermore, as the liquidity pools continue to grow additional gauge voting support is required to maintain the APR over time. Whilst the Aave Safety Module (SM) has the potential to be a more long term sustained solution, integrating BPTs that contain GHO, this requires time to develop and should not be rushed.\n\nMeanwhile, the [GHO price](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/) is consistently trading between 96 cents and 99 cents. When the liquidity in the GHO/Aave Boosted Pool was withdrawn, the GHO peg improved. This is because the pool was >85% GHO and had minimal USDC, USDT and DAI deposits. Increasing the GHO borrow rate is also expected to support the GHO peg as minting GHO to farm rewards in liquidity pools is less profitable.\n\n![|602x231](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7_4E7_tF8xRZe5tUFyoeXnJB3UbWDs7C7aGaohFzMjxM_aBGLmMvAREOjrtIS5yppMcrUaov3Q18-jIGcnjJk4x17wy91VheIUZSkIa0Y2a9Ay_kLTLRZ0w6zKR8PEpjE3jqJIBPzfF)\n\nThe LUSD/GHO pool on Maverick, is also heavily concentrated in GHO and migrating this liquidity to a wider liquidity band pool is expected to also help support the peg.\n\nCreating several concentrated liquidity pools is expected to help improve the GHO peg. These pools will have wide and narrow ranges. Liquidity will need to be migrated from the wide range to the narrow range pool over time. This will require more active management than what on-chain governance allows.\n\nThe recent CRV acquisition indicates the DAO will likely be supporting a GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve Finance. The current CRV holding can be used to kick start a pool, however additional support is likely to be needed to continue growing the pool. There is also a GHOFRAXBP pool being setup by the Frax team which can be co-incentivised. Pending how these pools progress, additional scope/budget may be added at a later stage.\n\nGiven the time sensitive nature of needing to support GHO liquidity, this publication proposes creating a Liquidity Committee with an initial budget. The committee shall focus solely on GHO liquidity and shall consist of a relatively small highly skilled team.\n\nThe Liquidity Committee can support GHO whilst other initiatives are being considered. Even after GHO liquidity pool receipt tokens are integrated into the SM, the Liquidity Committee can participate in bribe markets to boost the yield on the SM integrations.\n\nLonger term the DAO should revisit the impact of the committee and determine if it is still required. Furthermore, the composition of the committee should be revisited at a late date. With this in mind, this proposal suggests the Liquidity Committee’s initial mandate shall last for a 3 month duration.\n\n# Liquidity Strategy\n\nDetails on the liquidity strategy are to be detailed in a separate forum post. The liquidity strategy is to be implemented on the following Decentralise Exchanges:\n\n* Balancer\n* Maverick\n* Uniswap via Bunni\n\nThis forum post is to focus on the creation of the Liquidity Committee and associated fundings.\n\n# Performance Measures\n\nThe following performance measures are proposed:\n\n* Time GHO peg is above 98.5 cents and 99.0 cents\n  * % above/below 98.5 cents over trailing 7 days\n  * % above/below 99.0 cents over trailing 7 days\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Maverick\n  * Target $5M\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Uniswap\n  * Target $5M\n* Improvement in swap size for defined price impact via Cowswap or Paraswap\n  * 0.25% and 0.5% price impact to USDC\n* TVL in Balancer Liquidity Pools\n\nTarget $10M ($5M per pool)\n\nThese measures will be shown on the GHO Analytics platform provided by TokenLogic.\n\n# Committee Structure\n\nThe Liquidity Committee is to consist of 7 signers and will utilise a 4 of 7 SAFE to implement transactions. To ensure there is smooth operational consistency, there are distinct roles within the committee.\n\nTokenLogic will perform the following function:\n\n* Provide analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy\n* Liaise with teams that support the protocols hosting the GHO liquidity\n* Lead & Coordinate the committees weekly activities\n\nAll signers are to provide the following support:\n\n* Provide critical feedback / help refine the strategy\n* Verify and sign transactions\n\nIt should be noted, that actively managing liquidity takes time and effort to stay up to date with the attest events happening across all the protocols supporting GHO liquidity. Verifying transactions as a signer is also a notable time commitment.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe initial 3 months funding for the Liquidity Committee is as shown below:\n\n* 406,000 GHO - Liquidity Incentives\n* 5 ETH - Gas\n\nA breakdown of the Liquidity Incentive budget is shown below:\n![|602x224](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_P69n971i9uu38kLAiBQKpiESXHTZJc__Q6PKuvWCxxp7ZaHn7zU-eEVpFSHFcD1W2ZurPx49T-W4Dg0fY25krVHC07nZ0_XCQtyylq9LPafWuxv-G4Ca-19mWfE2-URZ-6BL94nIhH)\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the incentive budget and strategy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801).\n\nThere is a nominal 5 ETH allowance included in the budget. This amount was arbitrarily selected and ensures the SAFE & signing wallets are well funded.Some transactions can be executed directly from the SAFE.\n\nAny funds not used shall be returned to the Treasury or rolled over into supporting the next iteration of the Liquidity Committee.\n\n# Specification\n\nA Gnosis Safe will be created, this SAFE will hold funds and implement the quests. A small, high context team is proposed to implement the strategies modelled by the TokenLogic team.\n\n|Signer|Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Matthew Graham (TokenLogic)|0xb647055A9915bF9c8021a684E175A353525b9890|\n|Dydymoon (TokenLogic)|0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f|\n|Emilio|0x9C3E82658d10064121048A21c69978D3400abb25|\n|Marc (ACI)|0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4|\n|Figue (Paladin)|0x009d13E9bEC94Bf16791098CE4E5C168D27A9f07|\n|Solarcurve (Balancer)|0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3|\n|TokenBrice (DeFi Collective)|0xAA7A9d80971E58641442774C373C94AaFee87d66|\n\nTo fund the multisig, the following assets within the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO:\n\n* 406,000 [aEthDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n5 ETH and 406,000 units GHO are to be transferred from the Treasury to the Liquidity Committee multisig.\n\nAddress: `here`\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n### Treasury Management\n\n#### Develop the Architecture for Managing Aave's Assets\n\nWe aim to define a robust architecture for asset management. This architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s “shortExecutor”. Over time this will lead to fund management delegation and reduced governance overhead.\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n#### Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO’s known budget and anticipated expenses. \n\nThis approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO. Key components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds between networks;\n* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and\n* Swap assets to align expenses and holdings.\n\nDo note, that financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost-conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\n### Strategic Assets' Liquidity\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey will lead the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) and oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO’s price movement towards re-pegging while maintaining its utility across a full range of AMMs.\n    * Utilize Maverick’s design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n    * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n    * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n    * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility in their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave’s AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token’s value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n    * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n    * Enhance GHO’s extrinsic demand by incentivizing stable swap pools, such as Balancer’s GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n     * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer’s architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO’s price stability.\n     * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n    * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it into tangible rewards through participation in voting markets such as Curve, Convex, Balancer, and Aura.\n\nFor operational simplicity and alignment with the DAO’s strategic objectives, evolving the GHO Liquidity Committee into the Aave Liquidity Committee is a logical step. \n\n### Safety Module\n\nAs part of the scope, karpatkey and TokenLogic will focus on modelling the SM performance during shortfall events and present proposals to diversify asset categories. This proposal will feature how the DAO can utilize the vlAURA position, realize synergies between GHO Liquidity and overall attempt to reduce the DAOs insurance fund spend.\n\nThe below outlines at a high level what we intend to deliver:\n\n* Introduce additional asset categories to promote diversification and reduce the dependence on AAVE as a backstop for the protocol. \n    * Initial parameter configuration will incorporate feedback from @ChaosLabs & @Gauntlet. \n    * We will explore the feasibility of including GHO LP assets and harness rewards from other protocols.\n    * Technical lift associated with creating new categories will be performed by @bgdlabs, with a security audit, if required.\n* A 90-day emission forecast will be provided ahead of each emission cycle for community feedback. TokenLogic and karpatkey will prepare the payload to extend the SM emissions for @bgdlabs for review. \n    * Iterative emission cycles enable the DAO to target specific asset categories and improve the correlations between bad debt potential whilst maintaining a base level of insurance. The proposal will feature the ability to reward some categories with non AAVE rewards, like GHO, to support adoption and velocity.\n* Capital efficiency, optimize emission schedules to balance attracting and retaining new deposits for each respective category. For example, the APR on stkAAVE is expected to continue being reduced given the recent GHO Mint Discount utility being added and the introduction of new categories.\n* Analytics, a dashboard will be created/maintained that tracks the effective coverage of the insurance fund under various market conditions. The deposit value, composition of assets, APR over time and impact on the DAOs runway will all be readily available for the community to view. This is expected to create transparency and provide insight into the performance of the SM as an effective insurance fund for the DAO.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create two 180-day streams for 220k and 180k of GHO.\n\nThe following address will be the recipient of the 220k GHO stream:\nAddress: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\nThe following address will be the recipient of the 180k GHO stream:\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey will periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts, deployment and testing costs.\n\nUpon the ARFC Snapshot passing, the GLC SAFE Signers will be updated. The following signer `0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f` is to be replaced with `0x818c277dbe886b934e60aa047250a73529e26a99`.\n\nWhen the AIP onboarding TokenLogic and karpatkey as service providers pass, TokenLogic and karpatkey will jointly lead the GLC for the duration of the service provider contract with the Aave DAO.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

A later proposal will detail pool sizes, yield estimates and how this could after the $1 peg.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWhen shaping the liquidity strategy for GHO, we assessed various options with three main considerations:\n\n* Trading Pair\n* Decentralised Exchange (pool type)\n* Holistic Business Strategy\n\nThe largest trading pairs in Defi are ETH and USDC. For this reason we favour creating a USD stable coin liquidity pool and a LST / GHO liquidity pool.\n\n* USD stable coin liquidity pool\n* LST liquidity pool\n\nDeep stable coin liquidity helps GHO to retain it's $1 peg. Arbitrage trading is profitable with small price variations at large trade sizes. Therefore it is important to create a liquidity pool sufficient in size to facilitate large trade sizes with minimal price impact.\n\nAt launch, it is reasonable to expect volatility and minimal integrations in place at launch. As a result, the initial bootstraping phase is to be heavily dependent upon incentives to sustain liquidity and create peg resilience. When a spot price based oracle becomes available, we expect more sophisticated peg arbitrage strategies to become more readily available as yield strategy for various collateral types.\n\nThe Aave DAO and friend's veBAL holding is expected to play a material role in bootstrapping liquidity. Based upon our initial conversations, we believe Aave DAO will receive support in the form of veBAL to bootstrap GHO liquidity pools on Balancer.\n\n* Aave DAO\n* Reallocation of Protocol Fee Vote Incentive (PFVI)\n* Balancer Community Members\n* Aura Finance Community Members\n* Potentially Liquity\n* And Others\n\nAlthough gauges take some time to deploy, we anticipate the gauges being in production within as little as 1 week after launch.\n\n## Safety Module Considerations\n\nThe most dominant stable coins in Defi have centralised dependencies such as multisigs and off-chain counterparty risks etc... These centralised dependencies are less suitable for inclusion the SM. Similarly, any pool that includes an Aave Linear Pool, or aToken, shall be excluded from the SM due to systemic risk.\n\nThe following types of pools and assets are excluded from the SM:\n\n* Aave Linear Pools\n* USDC\n\nAdding GHO liquidity tokens into the SM helps achieve the following:\n\n* Sustain GHO liquidity\n* Diversifies the SM assets \n* GHO revenue slightly offsets SM costs\n\nLUSD is immutable and the most decentralised stable coin making it ideal for inclusion in the SM. More on this later. \n\n## Sustainability\n\nA key benefit of Aave Linear pools is that they deposit liquidity in Aave v3 and growing the Aave Boosted Pool on Balancer offers strategic benefit to Aave. A portion of yield derived from Aave Protocol is used attain BAL incentives, 32.5%. Lido DAO and Rocket Pool have both grown liquidity pools that can be mostly sustained by veBAL votes attained from Balancer's PFVI flywheel.\n\nThere is also the ability for Balancer DAO to redirect protocol fees used for bribing from the Aave Boosted Pool (bb-a-USD) towards the GHO/bb-a-USD or LST/GHO pool. The bb-a-USD pool currently has [$28.2M](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xfebb0bbf162e64fb9d0dfe186e517d84c395f016000000000000000000000502) of liquidity. \n\nNaturally, TokenLogic can work with the Balancer community to redirect Balancer protocol fee funded vote incentives to preferential pools.\n\nGiven the DAO's veBAL holding, our preference is for the primary pool to be on Balancer where BAL incentives will exceed the trading fee revenue generated on other DEXs. Curve and Convex are further progressed along there inflation schedule relative to Balancer and Aura. Therefore, whilst minimising dependencies on non Aave DAO voters, Balancer is a relatively better option than curve. We do support the CRV/sdCRV position be used to support GHO on Curve Finance.\n\nWith respect to the 80/20 pool, by having a larger allocation to an Yield Bearing Token (YBT), more yield is generated to fund vote incentives via the PFVI mechanism. Aave will have the option to incorporate this pool into the SM and the emissions will lead to reduced SM expenditure over time.\n\n## Primary Liquidity Pools\n\nWe propose the following primary liquidity pools for GHO:\n\n1) GHO / bb-a-USD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n2) LST / GHO (80/20) - Weighted Pool Factory\n3) GHO / LUSD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n\nOf the three pools, pools 1 and 2 qualify as core pools on Balancer with >50% of the pool generating yield.\n\nWith the SM integration being very unlikely at launch, we view adding BPTS to the SM as a longer term GHO growth option for the community to consider. The Aave SM budget is expected to be the main source of incentives for sustaining the GHO/LUSD pool which contains no YBT and does not qualify as a Core Pool on Balancer. \n\nUpon completing the SM upgrade, the PFVI and SM budget can be reallocated. For example, pool 2 PFVI *could* be redirected to pool 1 because pool 2 and 3 are sustained from the SM budget. The SM integration has the potential to create long lasting and sustained liquidity for GHO. It also could lead to additional assets being sustained within the SM using the same budget. \n\nDiscussions with Liquity relating to LUSD/GHO pool are promising. Liquity has a small vlAURA holding which can be used to support liquidity on Balancer. Gauges can be created when GHO is launched and then, if the Aave community supports the BPT being added to the SM, a new smBPT gauge can be deployed.\n\nWith the prospect of the LST/GHO pool being added to the SM, we are open to LST communities commenting below and volunteering initiatives that support growing this pool.\n\n## Secondary Pools\n\nEvery liquidity pool that contains GHO is positive for the Aave ecosystem. Therefore, we are open to experimenting and working with as many teams as possible. \n\nTo summaries, the following GHO secondary pools are being explored on a variety of DEXs:\n\n* GHO / FRAX\n* GHO / MAI\n* GHO / OHM\n\nSeveral teams are keen to incorporate and support GHO liquidity pools. A GHO / FRAXBP pool is one example within the Curve Finance ecosystem and other early integrations could include Olympus, Sommelier, Mellow, Maverick, Uniswap, Swaap and MAI Finance (Qi DAO) and more. \n\nWe favour creating many secondary liquidity pools over time across a variety of protocols.\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe following considerations will influence the expected size of the liquidity pools:\n\n* GHO Supply cap (100M units)\n* veBAL support beyond Aave DAO\n* vlAURA support\n\n# Specification\n\nGHO primary pools on Balancer v2 are shown below:\n\n1) GHO / bb-a-USD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n2) LST / GHO (80/20) - Weighted Pool Factory\n3) GHO / LUSD - ComposableStablePoolFactory\n\n# Next Steps\n\nAfter discussing and agreeing upon the GHO liquidity Pools, we will prepare a proposal for sizing the liquidity pools and present a plan for how to grow the liquidity.\n\nWe are hoping for comments below that indicate support from other communities which we will incorporate into the next proposal.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n@TokenLogic currently receives funding from the Butter Delegate Campaign and is a contributor @Llamaxyz.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Add PYUSD to Aave v3 Ethereum Market\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP proposes the onboarding of the PYUSD stablecoin, minted by Paxos Trust Company, into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPYUSD is a USD-pegged stablecoin minted through Paxos. While it’s still young, it has grown to a circulating supply of over $230M with strong peg resilience. Onboarding this asset into Aave will:\n\n* Build synergies between Aave and PYUSD.\n* Offer Aave users an additional stablecoin option.\n* Strengthen the relationship between the PYUSD & the GHO stablecoin. (Trident may explore the deployment of a PYUSD/GHO pool)\n\nWe propose a PYUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.\n\nIf the community deems that PYUSD as collateral is immediately viable we stand ready to support that role on day one; otherwise following PYUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for PYUSD at a later stage.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: PYUSD\nContract address: [0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8\n](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3ea9036406852006290770bedfcaba0e23a0e8)Price Feed: [0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8f1df6d7f2db73eece86a18b4381f4707b918fb1)\n\nChainlink Oracle: [https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/PYUSD-usd](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/pyusd-usd)\n\nWe propose the following parameters for a PYUSD onboarding:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap (PYUSD)|10M|\n|Borrow Cap (PYUSD)|9M|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|N/A|\n|LT|N/A|\n|Liquidation Bonus|N/A|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|80.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|8.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n|Flashloanable|No|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n\n## Liquidity and Market Cap\n\nThe PYUSD token was introduced a few months ago, and since its launch, its market cap has increased to approximately $230million. Over the coming weeks the pool will be scaled further with incentives in order to reach the necessary liquidity to support the proposed market parameters.\n\n![|624x488](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/X-CIRWD8o7MXopvExHIFu0nv9useOuTbrMej_SoD_zJskFtFpkHtvBVietrrSEjtVsfHdoUtOlSxfRCdH2HzoIJg-VpGcZhsfebkk17eDhBoS3RKPijCFDP2D_XbMKeJ1C-jP8XeTWtOwJpPEhLC3Fk)\n\nWhen analyzing market cap and trading volumes of assets for listing, we look at the available historical data. The 30 Day average Market Cap of PYUSD is $170M with a 30 day average volume of $4.7M. Over the last 7 days, the average Market cap has climbed to $209M with the same period seeing an average volume of $8.7M, the volume and aum increase is on the back of prior stakeholder efforts and we expect both to grow meaningfully in the coming weeks.\n\n![|604x476](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WzRKS4ZDZop1OhjeZG-qnhCYb3x3zT5bT8gE6AlJAJZBjcqmWMR7HcKXnrngqWlUV3MYeZI-W3xcMHRzFx6RA-BCDF3_SrKJR4ahLDB2jVp6Rm0-12PbBSrrgD6l-D23uhk8Kogpr2lVYEIiMCYtn7U)\n\nWith peg holding well since inception, an average intra-day volatility of ~0.01%, and the ability of onboarded institutional investors to redeem PYUSD 1:1 with Paxos, we see low risk related to the stability of PYUSD’s price.\n\n### Initial Supply and Borrow Caps\n\nPYUSD circulating supply is ~$230M. Given PYUSD is a new asset listing, we recommend adopting a conservative approach for setting supply and borrow caps for PYUSD, which gives room to expand caps should cap usage be elevated. We recommend a supply cap of 25M and a borrow cap of 20M.\n\n### Variable Borrow Rate\n\nWe recommend setting slope 1 to 7% due to current on-chain stable yield opportunities which we believe will remain viable for the foreseeable future.\n\n### Borrowable in Isolation\n\nWe do not see excess risk with enabling PYUSD being borrowable in isolation. If the community wishes to take a more conservative stance, it may wish to only limit PYUSD borrowing to non-isolated collateral.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Paxos or Trident and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. . If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
