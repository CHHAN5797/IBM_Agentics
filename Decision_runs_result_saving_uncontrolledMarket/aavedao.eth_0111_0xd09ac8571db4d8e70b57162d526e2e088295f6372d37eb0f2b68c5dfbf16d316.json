        "body": "## Overview\n\nThis proposal continues on the proposed steps from [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719) by recommending the removal of sUSD as collateral on Aave V3’s Optimism. Additionally, we recommend reducing the LT and LTV of the Stablecoin E-Mode on Optimism, which sUSD is part of, and setting sUSD LTV to 0.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis recommendation follows the recent proposal to reduce the supply and borrow cap of sUSD to 10m and 1, respectively; that recommendation follows a period of reduced sUSD DEX liquidity, which dropped to a buy-side low of $2M before recovering after the introduction of token incentives.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151805.225.png](ipfs://bafkreihgsfq3rklem3uewkfzhpofau2fc7mkp742shace72sae7aay3d7i)\nDuring this period, shorting activity on sUSD was observed between January 9th and January 15th. Following the implementation of token incentives on January 16th, as detailed in [this announcement](https://x.com/synthetix_io/status/1878944713446924552), these short positions were closed, and new borrowing demand primarily came from users farming the newly introduced incentives.\n\nBelow, we present a table of the current sUSD borrows on Aave and the associated strategy exposure. The distribution of such strategies seems to be quite dispersed, with the recent incentive structure leading to demand to create perpetual positions on Synthetix coupled with liquidity pool growth rather than short positions.\n\n| User | Action | Size | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0xD8b88C185e06eBF8C58B7dc8b7AFf18304CdD888 | Short | 350k | Jan 9 to Jan 15 |\n| 0x49bf093277bf4dde49c48c6aa55a3bda3eedef68 | LP | 150k | 16th |\n| 0x407cff84eeaacda390fe302c99fa5dd32521bc53 | Holding | 400k | 16th |\n| 0xe31deacee1770dfa56f8849724bcb7f8e5f76ef2 | LP | 130k | 16th |\n| 0xf7ca1f0ff0995c84fef530f7c74c69fb80331e81 | Perp | 200k | 16th |\n| 0x9644a6920bd0a1923c2c6c1dddf691b7a42e8a65 | Perp+LP | 750k | 16th |\n| 0xfd81b27d9796a1ba7d7171ea70010c9befb2a62a | Perp | 380k | 17th |\n\n### Peg Dynamics and Mechanism Design\n\nAn analysis of the peg and utilization dynamics revealed that the deviation can be attributed to a combination of multiple factors, including traders profiting from the Synthetix Perpetual platform, the lack of interest rate on sUSD debt in an environment of heightened rates, and the ongoing migration to Synthetix V3 which reduces the demand for sUSD. This created an imbalance as this excess supply was not met with proportional demand, putting downward pressure on the price of sUSD. This conclusion is supported by the increase in sUSD’s market cap, which closely followed the downward price deviation and the growth in interest rates.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151807.732.png](ipfs://bafybeicynmyw2iywjymc2s6lbeyjbavpcvsdwnqpwxoz2fnd3av36u3kkm)\nWhile this behavior does not pose a risk to sUSD’s fundamental backing, the exit of sUSD’s price from its concentrated liquidity range reduced buy-side liquidity, thereby increasing Aave's risk to sUSD positions. This liquidity constraint underpinned the recommendation to reduce caps, aiming to mitigate Aave's risk.\n\n### Removing sUSD as Collateral\n\nWith the recent deterrence of the creation of new sUSD debt on Aave and continued minimized supply exposure, the majority of outstanding debt is fundamentally leveraged to explicitly contribute to the recent sUSD incentive programs by minimizing effective peg exposure. However, while highly overcollateralized, the current economics associated with the soft peg mechanism is fundamentally shaky; minimizing the usage of sUSD as collateral is recommended to be performed as a preventive measure. The current distribution of such sUSD-collateralized stablecoin debt positions is highly conservative, as can be seen below, thereby requiring a significant depeg to start to contribute negatively to the Aave protocol, and the expectation is such that exposure will continue to be minimized over time, as has been the case with a 3M reduction in supply on Aave (25%) over the last 7 days.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151810.268.png](ipfs://bafkreichtqxkc33sgfqdmovkfkb52lal52eksh3ynamdjoghnkt333o3fe)\n![image - 2025-01-30T151812.842.png](ipfs://bafkreifmjwarbys4s3iecgetat2nmeyxp22qa4r7jyjbsru2qlrrpapvdy)\nMoreover, during a swift depeg event 7 months ago, we proposed an immediate LTV0 change due to the deprecation of their spot synths contributing to significant downward pressure, as can be seen [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719). The fundamental characteristics of the asset eventually improved once more through mechanical changes on Synthetix’s side in the redemption process, leading to the unfreezing of the asset, as seen in [this](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-parameter-recommendations-susd-on-v3-optimism-05-23-2024/17779) post. However, we continued to reduce exposure in the form of decreasing caps significantly coupled with decreasing LTV/LTs in both the general market and E-Mode configuration, leading to a more conservative state. As such, a significant buffer of 6% price movement already exists between the collateral value at the LT and the bad debt threshold of 1/(1+LB) in e-mode itself.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo further improve this safety buffer and given the conservative distribution of collateralized debt positions throughout the stablecoin E-Mode config on Optimism, we recommend decreasing the LTV/LT in Stablecoins E-Mode while minimizing induced liquidations.\n\nConsidering the current positioning within the E-Mode, we estimate the optimal LT reduction to be 87%. While we intend to deprecate the E-Mode and remove sUSD from it progressively, this change poses an initial step in that direction. Chaos Labs will monitor the market and introduce additional Liquid E-Modes if demand for a stablecoin-correlated E-Mode remains.\n\nThe change to 87% LT is expected to cause the liquidation of just $95K of collateral.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151815.223.png](ipfs://bafkreihlu36ppeeaml3zkpfe7vuf2iqfakfent4yzb2n3i3xqnpw7ixwpm)\nThe liquidations caused at the recommended LT are primarily stablecoins with significant liquidity to support the minimal liquidation size, with sUSD liquidations only representing $2.4K, or 3.2%.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151817.770.png](ipfs://bafkreieomtso2cfoswuhmg6ehmc4sdsxd3wrrdtgicbzd57u44tgetqlmu)\nAdditionally, we recommend setting the LTV of sUSD outside of the Stablecoin Correlated E-Mode to 0; this measure will prevent additional borrowing from being performed using sUSD as collateral, hence limiting the future risk posed by an sUSD downward deviation. \n\nThis measure will simultaneously apply to both sUSD parameters within and outside of the E-Mode, hence limiting the opening of new positions.\n\nFollowing an improvement of the sUSD peg and a reduction in sUSD-denominated collateral, Chaos Labs will reinstate the borrow cap to a defined value determined by our methodology.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the sUSD asset on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Asset | Deployment | Current LTV | Rec. LTV |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sUSD | Optimism | 60.00% | 0.00% |\n\nFor the Stablecoin E-Mode on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Rec. Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LTV | 90.00% | 0.00% |\n| LT | 93.00% | 87.00% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "![Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 11.49.57](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rytN7ZMH6.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces @TokenLogic and @Karpatkey as the DAO’s Financial Service Provider for an initial period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 400k GHO. The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:\n\n* Treasury Management;\n* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and\n* Safety Module.\n\nThe combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Treasury Management\n\nAave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.\n\n![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI \"Chart\")\n\nIn spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.\n\n### Portfolio Volatility\n\nA significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.\n\n![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA \"Chart\")\n\n### Asset Dispersion\n\nTreasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)\n\nThe DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.\n\n### Runway\n\nAccording to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.\n\n|Category|Budget $k|Duration (mths)|Annualized Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Security¹|$1,500|6|$3,000|\n|[Risk Management](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194/8)|$1,600|12|$1,600|\n|Bug Bounty|$1,000|12|$1,000|\n|Gov.

Certora only.\n2. AGD figures based on discussions with the team.\n\nWhile there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.\n\n![|669x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Aq6xqeeq_hr2ObgV9PFBiQrn6BFRk718dJywySHO4U7jRyUXSsMDyl7CdMhdf1cGOht1143KdBZy4mEagWkrum9CBeapl2HnDnSFfRbFNaPB4-3pZH0veEu8nMoo2cAw3-uohJYNq8s8zKUn-J45spg \"Chart\")\n\nWith the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.\n\n## GHO Development\n\nAave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.\n\nAiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.\n\nWith an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).\n\n![|690x391](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7UXzX05dWaMixQmE4B-lkjHuv4-fu2jIFs8bn03_gLYG8hjpIm2mPHK4uhWVcyetMgZPUlWekoavWr1pfc43F15YuXkIZPy1r1K71mtU6WxdBl4rdzw4zMiABAUsHgRDP4d-BdkW_E-EcFgA1qArif0)\n\n![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)\n\nAs demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.\n\nFor the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:\n\n### Peg Mechanisms\n\nThere's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.\n\n### Demand\n\nThe second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.\n\n![|654x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0K9JhuF5N6ScUkxYuGisZNp4S0IQ0qfc1ZvnW59aTIzisXhXB-4w5PX_2pzyTKs9sOlZkPikzm2IPx-uC_B366JsFOyHrmVqFYdLfmef0fBEaXquwkH-f48RAzVfmM9AqARhdcJ_EIQn7IrxaMv2fU0)\n\nCurrently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.\n\n![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)\n\nIf a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.\n\nFurthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.\n\n![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)\n\nThe daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.\n\n## Why Partnering?\n\nAll of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.\n\nThere hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:\n\n* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and\n* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.\n\nThe combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.\n\n### TokenLogic\n\nWe are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.\n\nOur dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.\n\n### karpatkey\n\nkarpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.\n\nAs DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.\n\nIn addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.\n\nWe now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling\n\nWe aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s \"shortExecutor\". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n## Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;\n* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and\n* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.\n\nDo note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\nAs it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.\n\n## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee\n\nThis expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.\n  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.\n  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",

Currently, the SM is overly concentrated in AAVE via direct AAVE staking and ABPT staking which is a Balancer v1 80/20 AAVE/wETH liquidity token.\n\nThis publication seeks to explore the community's appetite to diversify the SM asset base and vary the portion of users' funds which can be auctioned in the event of a shortfall. Currently, 30% of user deposits are at risk when depositing into the SM.\n\n# Motivation\n\n@bgdlabs is currently proposing to upgrade the [SM architecture](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12148) to support the launch of GHO, by enabling stkAAVE holders to access cheaper GHO borrowing rates. Further to this, Llama has kick started the conversation around migrating AAVE liquidity from Balancer v1 to v2 in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-safety-module-update-part-i-migrate-aave-weth-balancer-v1-pool-to-balancer-v2/12748).\n\nSeveral comments relating to the AAVE concentration and auction mechanism have been made on the forum which can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/size-x-aave-auction-safety-module/11984), [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-extend-safety-module-coverage-to-polygon-v3/11876/4).\n\nThis publication presents three distinct categories for inclusion in the SM.\n\n* Single Asset\n* Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions\n* Stable Asset Liquidity Positions\n\nThe net change to the existing implementation is the introduction of a third category, Stable Asset Liquidity Positions. The existing AAVE and ABPT represent Single Asset and Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions.\n\nAlthough any Liquidity Provider (LP) position can be included, G-Uni, crvLP, BPT etc… This publication will initially focus on the overarching concept and how BPTs could be integrated.\n\nBPTs were selected due to Aave’s relationship with Balancer DAO and the veBAL holding which the community may elect to utilize here. It should be stressed, Aave DAO will elect which assets are to be included and the varying levels of slashing for each category.\n\nAssets considered for inclusion should have minimal counterparty risk and display great on-chain liquidity amongst other considerations such as price correlation with Aave Protocol’s TVL during varying market conditions.\n\nLlama proposes three initial asset categories to be created within the SM.\n\nThe slashing parameters update aims to reduce the price impact on the AAVE token in the case of a shortfall event. We propose adding different levels of slashing to each category, as follows:\n\n## Single Assets\n\nThe current single asset, with 30% slashing, is AAVE. This proposal introduces other assets to this category with the goal of reducing the concentration of AAVE inside the insurance fund.\n\nPossible assets for consideration inside the SM Single Asset Category include, not limited to:\n\n* AAVE\n* ETH and/or wstETH\n\nIf the community elects with the introduction of additional assets other than AAVE, then each asset could be considered individually. This publication retains the 30% slashing feature for Single Asset.\n\nThe inclusion of wstETH may attract additional incentives from Lido DAO, therefore Llama prefers having the ability to distribute multiple rewards types with external teams able to distribute their own token. Something similar to the Emission Admin role on Aave v3 will suffice.\n\nLlama preference is for wstETH over wETH due to improved capital efficiency by enabling users to earn an overall higher APY from being a SM depositor. wstETH has become a major trading pairing token on Balancer and it has ample liquidity across various pools to route swaps through. Additionally, the stETH-ETH discount has reduced significantly (0.9938:1 for 100K ETH sold, which also demonstrates [very deep liquidity](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=ethereum&from=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&to=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).\n\nLlama would also encourage Lido DAO to indicate any potential support for this type of integration between the two protocols as inclusion in the SM would act to help retain or grow wstETH adoption via the creation of a unique use case for wstETH relative to other LSTs.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 30% retained for single assets.\n\nInitial assets proposed: AAVE / ETH and/or stETH\n\n## Risks Considerations\n\nIf LSTs (such as wstETH) are included in the SM, it creates a price divergence risk which, if sustained, can reduce the cover in the SM and create an unfair distribution of the rewards between ETH & wstETH. Post redemption the main risk consideration for LSTs becomes counterparty risk which if it materialized would lead to a significant discount to the LST price in ETH terms.\n\n* To limit the de-peg risk, the SM could stop incentivizing below a defined ratio, so the total value would then be deduced from the total cover value. This acts to mitigate counterparty risk without requiring governance intervention.\n\nBased upon technical feedback relating to the ease of implementation, Llama may revise this section of the publication.\n\n## Volatile Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn addition to the replacement pool for the 80/20 AAVE/wETH pool on Balancer v1, to be determined by an earlier publication. This publication presents two other pools of strategic importance to Aave DAO for inclusion in the SM.\n\nThis publication presents the prospect of creating an 80/20 GHO/wETH (or wstETH) which offers less impermanent loss than a 50/50 pool whilst also providing very deep liquidity for risk off events which see spikes in stable coin swap volumes which can often lead to stable coins trading above $1.\n\nFor the following categories, up to 75% of the current budget could be allocated.\n\nMax slashing proposed 45% for volatile BPTs\n\nInitial volatile BPTs proposed: B-80AAVE-20wstETH (or Part I proposal results) & B-80GHO-20WETH\n\nEven if not yet created, this is probably the most interesting addition to this category as the trading volume of this pool will generate an important yield for LPs. The second pool could also be converted into a [Balancer Core Pool](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) by replacing ETH by IBTs as described in Part I.\n\n## Stable Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn this third category, this publication presents an initial pool consisting of the Balancer [3pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x79c58f70905f734641735bc61e45c19dd9ad60bc0000000000000000000004e7) and GHO. Like other categories, in the future, additional assets can be added. If the community elects to launch BB-A-USD/GHO on Balancer or a stable coin pool on Curve, then this section can pivot to include the Curve pool.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 60% for stable\n\nInitial Stable BPT proposed: B-3Pool/GHO\n\nThis pool introduces a stable asset to the SM design and generates a significant amount of the coverage as 60% of the TVL can be slashed with very low price impact across the broader ecosystem. This is especially the case if something like Cowswap’s auction mechanism was to feature in the new SM auction mechanism.\n\nBy integrating a GHO pair to the SM, Aave is essentially helping bootstrapping GHO adoptions through incentivised liquidity. Aave will also earn revenue from the GHO borrowing rate.\n\nIf the community elects to proceed with 3CRV/GHO, then this would increase the SM smart contract surface area through diversifying exposure concentration away from Balancer to include Cuve Finance and potentially Convex Finance risk as well.\n\nThere is also the option of adding additional pools which could include GHO, MAI, LUSD, FRAX and others once live like crvUSD etc…\n\nThis proposal can be implemented independently from the following parts. In this case, “classic” gauges would be advised. Otherwise, the strategy & smBPT gauges discussions will be outlined & discussed in Part III.\n\n# Technical Specifications:\n\n* Remove the BPT 80/20 from the current main module (30% slashing)\n* Deploy two other modules on the SM for the new categories (45% & 60% slashing)\n* Implement the new assets voted on Part II for the new categories\n* Create the new pools depending on vote results\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Implement Changes\nNAE- Rework Proposal\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

        "author": "0xeEEC0e4927704ab3BBE5df7F4EfFa818b43665a3",
        "body": "Author: Alchemix Core Team\nForum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-alusd-as-borrowable-to-aave-v2/7191\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave. alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity, and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow. Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD, with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD. alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools, with ~450m in liquidity. In addition to the Curve pool, alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap, Saddle, and mStable. According to Parsec Finance’s StableRank, alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1% slippage. Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions, alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE.\n\n[alUSD StableRank Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/iMyToUj)\n\n# About Alchemix and alUSD\nAlchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO. Alchemix is, at its core, an overcollateralized stablecoin, much like DAI and other similar tokens. It has some key differences however.\n\nAlchemix only mints like-kind or “mirror” al-Assets. For example, alUSD is only mintable by DAI (and later USDT and USDC), and alETH is only mintable by ETH (and later other ETH derivatives). Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn, of which the earned yield doubly repays users’ debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module. In addition, there is no interest paid in the borrowing of al-Assets. Due to this structure, Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system. This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions - taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI. In effect, the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits.\n\nAlchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms.\n1. 50% LTV for minting alUSD, which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol.\n2. DAO-managed debt caps that limit the over-minting of alUSD\n3. The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI. If alUSD is under the peg, people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount. If alUSD is over the peg, users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price, and they can self-liquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage.\n4. The Transmuter module guarantees 1:1 conversions of alUSD to DAI, the conversion process isn’t instant, but it can present good arbitrage opportunities, which helps to stabilize the peg.\n5. Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers, which attracts liquidity to the pool, further boosting the peg.\n\nalUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200%, while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100%. The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157%. The supply can expand in two ways – an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans, or debt repayments with DAI, which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD. This is how we have a supply of ~239m with a current debt cap of 150m. alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter, where it is converted 1:1 to DAI over time.\n\nThese mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the $1 peg since its inception.\n\n# Motivation\nalUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin. In addition to protocol improvements, Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal. Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto, getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD. The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi, the more resilient it will become, which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply.\n\nGoing forward, Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral, and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies. AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future. When these upgrades take place, we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE, similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn.\n\n# alUSD Benefits to Aave Users\nalUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI, USDC, USDT, mUSD, FEI, FRAX, and LUSD in our various markets. It is simple to swap between other stables. DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too. In addition, there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs. For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but don’t have stablecoins from which to mint it, borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD. The alUSD can be used for yield farming, or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins, to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market. alUSD is also used in an alETH/alUSD options market on premia.finance. Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations.\n\n# Security Considerations and Risk Analysis\nCertik Audit for the Core Contracts: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf\n\nCurrently, the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting, which is then executed by a community + developer multisig + timelock contract. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.\n\nAave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD, and assigned an overall risk rating of B+ [Risks per Asset - Risk](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risks-per-asset). USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. USDC and USDT have ratings of A- and B+ respectively. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks. Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral.\n\nThe Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token. It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. Currently, all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemist.sol contract. When we launch our version two, the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions. Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions. The core alchemist.sol contract cannot be upgraded, but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters: collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, and fee percentage. Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemix’s sentinel mode, which pauses the contract in case of an emergency.\n\n# Protocol Data\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap - 242,165,957 USD.\n- 24h Volume - typically ranges between 1-4m.\n- Markets: Curve, Saddle, Sushi, mStable, Premia\n\n### Social Channels data (Size of communities, activity on github)\n- Twitter: 40.2k\n- Discord: 7.5k\n- Medium: 1.7k\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens:\n- alUSD Deployment Date: 2/27/2021\n- Transactions: 49,594\n- Token Holders: 1328\n\n# Implementation\nThe alUSD price oracle will be served via Chainlink.

        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.\n\n# Motivation\n\nStaking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n[Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/jgf1/Stakewise)\n[Audits - Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)\n[Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n[Medium](https://stakewise.medium.com/)\n[Github Page\n](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts)[sETH2 contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a)\n[StakeWise dual tokenomics](https://stakewise.medium.com/the-tokenomics-of-staking-pools-what-are-staked-eth-tokens-and-how-do-they-work-2b4084515711)\n[StakeWise Metro Upgrade](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8)\n\nCommunities: [Discord](https://discord.gg/vM3a3csBDS) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n# Specifications\n\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nI (Jordan Sutcliffe) am the BizDev Lead at StakeWise, submitting the proposal on behalf of StakeWise DAO.\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\n->*StakeWise Overview*\n\nStakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.\n\nETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).\n\nAs a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.\n\nDmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).\n\nStakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).\n\n->*sETH2 Overview*\n\nsETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.\n\nsETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.\n\n**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.\n\nsETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.\n\nsETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nStakeWise’s background is detailed above.\n\nStakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\nInvestors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.\n\nThe StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nFirst and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.\n\nCreating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\n-> *Multi-sigs*\n\nStakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).\n\nThe DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.\n\n1.

The DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n**Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nMarket Cap ~$167M\n\nVolatility -\n\nsETH2 has proven peg stability. Superimposing stETH / ETH with sETH2 / ETH highlights this stability when compared against stETH which is already whitelisted for Aave.\n\n![|624x205](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV-tgDKkGvUmpr9MP6D9-qWNApCsLGrTiBqlIGL3K4IfXl2MB--glv35OerGGzZteAOZaAtbKVkCsGhGUuzgxD4JWBDpv76zk0QkfRaEMpIGAuuOuo1Ot6Ey8GF6qRC6c3JHTA60)\n\nNote that StakeWise will soon be adjusting the main UniSwap pool by reducing the fee tier from 0.3% to 0.01%, which is expected to close the remaining gap between sETH2 and ETH. StakeWise is also in the process of launching a new pool on Curve which will further increase sETH2’s peg resilience.\n\n**Volumes and DEXs**\n\n-> [UniSwap V3 Pool (sETH2/ETH)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)\n\nLiquidity: $160M\n\nVolume (24h): ~$350k on avg.\n\n-> [Curve Pool (sETH2/stETH)](https://curve.fi/factory/105)\n\nThis pool is in the final stages of being set up, with the addition of a liquidity gauge ([gauge proposal](https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/165)) passing recently and at least 5k ETH of seed liquidity to be added ([proposal here](https://snapshot.fei.money/#/proposal/0xa4115f24e824b09109991e1e369ba48c60921f503fe3efa4b39d4612eeb51533)).\n\n-> StakeWise is in discussions with multiple other protocols to create further liquidity pools with a diverse range of assets.

Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.\n\n4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).\n\nAs previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.\n\n-> *Staking risks*\n\nsETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:\n\n* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.\n* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.\n* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).\n\nNote that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.\n\nStakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.\n\n-> *Smart Contract Risks*\n\nStakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).\n\nDespite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.\n\n-> *Price Oracles*\n\nsETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.\n\n# Proposed Risk Parameters\n\n* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)\n* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)\n\nThe proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.\n\n### Interest Rate Model:\n\nUOptimal: 50%\nBase: 0%\nSlope 1: 8%\nSlope 2: 200%\n\n",

Despite concerns about hardcoding and USDT exposure risks, the proposal is supported by extensive risk analysis, highlighting that the current USDe/USD market price feed exposes sUSDe-backed positions to unexpected liquidations and bad debt risk. The proposed change aligns pricing more closely with USDe's operational ties to USDT, backed by an insurance fund and risk mitigations such as automated guardians and potential parameter adjustments. Historical similar proposals about risk management changes also passed with a 'For' vote, though they showed negative post-vote market impacts. Forum sentiment was mostly negative or neutral, reflecting concerns about hardcoding and USDT dependency, but a minority supports the proposal as the best available option.
