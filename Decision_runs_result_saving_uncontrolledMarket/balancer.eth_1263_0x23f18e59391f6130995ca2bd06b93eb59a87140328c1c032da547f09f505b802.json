Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.\n\nThe Synthereum protocol has four modules:\n\n* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.\n* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.\n* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.\n* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.\n\nMost jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, Midas, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy).\n\n### Mimo Capital\n\nMimo Protocol is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. The stablecoin (PAR) is decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro fiat currency.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the 2eur (PAR) pool is to increase the stability of PAR (1), the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and jEUR (2), and connect the Mimo and Jarvis ecosystems (3). Together, these 3 points allow for building an European DeFi ecosystem.\n\n1. PAR peg: PAR is issued following the CDP model; if PAR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy PAR cheaper and repay their debt; if PAR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow PAR and sell them at a higher price; since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC and ETH back and forth at the EURUSD and computed ETH/EUR Chainlink price feed and without price impact, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the PAR peg; so if PAR trades below or above its peg, anyone can perform an arbitrage without having to go through a CDP.\n2. On-chain liquidity:\n\n* PAR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap PAR to jEUR and then to USDC or ETH to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases PAR liquidity.\n* jEUR: jEUR main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jEUR minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets), and this is why we are launching this pool as well as other pools (jEUR-WETH, 2eur-bb-am-usd, etc.\n\n3. Connect ecosystems: the 2eur pool connects Mimo and its PAR (essentially a way to borrow Euros with various collateral) to the jEUR’s ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases.\n\n* Credit without FX risk: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.).\n* Leverage short on EUR/XXX: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR, redeem for ETH or USDC, and repeat.\n* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, and a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium. This pool can help users to buy PAR with Euros or to sell PAR for Euros.\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions.\n* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).\n* With Mimo Labs, we have been launching the 2eur (and 4eur) pool on Curve. The 2eur pool did a volume of $4M since August 2022, with a TVL of $0.5-$1M.\n* Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield.\n* Finally, we will also deploy a 2eur (PAR) - bb-am-usd pool or a 2eur (PAR) - 2eur (agEUR) - 2eur (EURT) - 2eur (EURe) - bb-am-usd pool depending on what would be the best for the liquidity and risk tolerance of LPs.\n* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (locked as vlAURA) & BAL. Mimo Labs is currently working on a proposal for the Mimo Protocol to acquire AURA & BAL then lock them.\n* Mimo Labs will provide liquidity in the 2eur pool and use 100% of the generated fees for vote incentives veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL (Mimo Labs is also working on a proposal to whitelist their multisig for Balancer’s Voting Escrow. In the case where the proposal is accepted, 100% of fees generated will be locked for $veBAL instead of be used for vote incentives)\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1.

Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.\n\nThe Synthereum protocol has four modules:\n\n* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.\n* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.\n* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.\n* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.\n\nMost jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, Midas, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy, Dotdot, etc.).\n\n### Angle Protocol\n\nAngle is a decentralized stablecoin protocol designed to be both over-collateralized and capital-efficient. The protocol has launched agEUR, a Euro stablecoin, which has become one of the biggest decentralized Euro stablecoin. The TVL in the Angle Protocol is $46m with 30m agEUR in circulation.\n\nThere are different mechanisms (also called modules) by which agEUR can be issued all having in common that agEUR must be released on the market in an over-collateralized way.\n\n- In the Core module of the protocol, agEUR can be minted from USDC, DAI and FRAX at oracle value. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by relying on the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol and by transaction fees. agEUR issued from this means represent the biggest share of the agEUR in circulation, and they are currently over-collateralized at 200%\n\n- The protocol also has a borrowing module where agEUR can be borrowed against different assets (ETH, wBTC, wstETH) like on Maker. This module is deployed on different chains (including Polygon)\n\n- The protocol is also engaged in algorithmic market operations (also called direct deposit modules). It has for instance minted agEUR natively on Aave and on Euler. In these cases, agEUR enter in circulation when they are borrowed in an over-collateralized way on the corresponding protocol. Protocol also mints agEUR on the agEUR-EUROC Curve pool when this pool has more EUROC than agEUR (like what FRAX is doing)\n\n[agEUR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ageur) has kept a super tight peg since its launch. It is involved in several other gauges on Curve as well (agEUR-EURs-EURt, agEUR-ibEUR, agEUR-EUROC-cEUR, agEUR-EUROC) which have historically yielded a pretty important volume.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the 2eur (agEUR) pool is to increase the stability of agEUR (1), the on-chain liquidity of both agEUR and jEUR (2), and connect the Angle and Jarvis ecosystems (3). Together, these 3 points allow for building an European DeFi ecosystem.\n\n1. agEUR peg: on Polygon, agEUR is issued following the CDP model; if agEUR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy agEUR cheaper and repay their debt; if agEUR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow agEUR and sell them at a higher price; users can also perform a cross-chain arbitrage between Ethereum and Polygon (since on Ethereum one can swap agEUR for USDC at the EURUSD Chainlink price feed without price impact) but since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, MAI and ETH back and forth at the EURUSD and computed ETH/EUR Chainlink price feed and without price impact on Polygon, arbitrages can be directly performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the agEUR peg.\n2. On-chain liquidity:\n\n* agEUR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, MAI and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH, MAI or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap agEUR to jEUR and then to USDC, MAI or ETH to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa.

Connect ecosystems: the 2eur pool connects Angle and its agEUR liquidity and ecosystem to the jEUR’s, enabling multiple use cases.\n\n* Credit without FX risk: borrow agEUR or jEUR, swap for jEUR or agEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.) or agEUR (Mt Pelerin, Monerium, …).\n* Leverage short on EUR/XXX: borrow agEUR or jEUR, swap for jEUR or agEUR, swap for ETH, MAI or USDC, and repeat.\n* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: both agEUR and jEUR have a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Mt Pelerin, but it comes with a high fee. jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, so this pool can help users to buy agEUR with Euros or to sell agEUR for Euros.\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions.\n* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).\n* With Angle, we have been launching the 2eur (agEUR) pool on Curve.

VCHF is backed by Swiss Francs and issued by VNX, and jCHF is backed by crypto and is issued by the Jarvis Network.\n\n# References/Useful links:\n\n## Jarvis Network:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Website:[ https://jarvis.network/](https://jarvis.network/)\n* Documentation:[ https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network/)\n* Code:[ jarvis-network / apps / Mono-repo / Synthereum · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/mono-repo)\n* Social:[ https://twitter.com/Jarvis_Network](https://twitter.com/Jarvis_Network)\n* Audits:[ Add SynthereumV6 audit report (f50be59f) · Commits · jarvis-network / apps / Mono-repo / Synthereum · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network/apps/exchange/mono-repo/-/commit/f50be59fbe43304302c51d90c24aaa97d1320b73)\n\n## VNX:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Websites:[ https://vnx.li/](https://vnx.li/)\n* Code:[ https://gitlab.com/vnx/ethereum-contracts](https://gitlab.com/vnx/ethereum-contracts)\n* Social:[ https://twitter.com/vnx_platform](https://twitter.com/vnx_platform)\n* Audits:[ https://vnx.li/transparency/](https://vnx.li/transparency/)\n\n# Protocol Description:\n\n## Jarvis Network\n\nJarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.\n\nThe Synthereum protocol has four modules:\n\n* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.\n* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.\n* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.\n* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.\n\nMost jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (VNX, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be borrowed on jarvis.money, can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy).\n\n## VNX\n\nVNX, a Liechtenstein-based company licensed by the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA), is developing a more secure and reliable infrastructure for global transactions by introducing gold-backed and fiat stablecoins.\n\nVNX fiat stablecoins expands investor capabilities in the crypto space by offering digital assets referencing fiat currencies. The first fiat referencing tokens presented to the market were VNX Euro (VEUR) and VNX Swiss Franc (VCHF). VNX stablecoins provide the ability for crypto users to trade in their native currencies as well as manage their portfolio more effectively: to hedge, trade, and profit with more options.\n\nVNX Gold (VNXAU) is the first European multichain token backed by physical gold certified by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) and represents individual ownership of the gold (1 VNXAU token is equal to 1 gram of physical gold). With VNX Gold investors can get the same benefits as investing in physical gold, such as store of value, protection against volatility and inflation, and high liquidity – with complete digital convenience and freedom. The physical gold backing VNXAU is stored in an isolated, high-security vault in Liechtenstein, a country with stable economy, S&P AAA rating and an EEA member.\n\nVNX tokens are traded on crypto exchanges such as LBank, BitForex,[ XT.COM](http://xt.com/) and Emirex, and the list of trading venues is growing, so stay tuned to keep updated.\n\nToken generation and all token services are carried out by VNX Commodities, a company registered with the Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority (FMA) under the TT Token Providers and Services Act (TVTG). The list of licenses can be found at the regulator’s registry at this[ link](https://fmaregister.fma-li.li/search?searchText=&number=310339&category=).\n\nThe total funding for the project is 7.3 million euros with the lead investor Woori Technology Investment (South Korea).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThere is no yield or on-chain liquidity for CHF Stablecoins, and the latter are yet to be integrated within DeFi.\n\nThe role of the 2chf (VCHF) pool is to increase the stability of VCHF (1), the on-chain liquidity of both VCHF and jCHF (2), and connect the VNX and Jarvis ecosystems (3). Together, these 3 points allow for building a Swiss DeFi ecosystem.\n\n1. VCHF peg: VCHF maintains its pegged thanks to on/off-chain arbitrages, since it is redeemable for CHF at a 1:1 ratio. The 2chf (VCHF) pool would enable arbitrages to happen entirely on-chain, increasing VCHF stability.\n2. On-chain liquidity:\n\n* VCHF: since jCHF can be exchanged for USDC without price impact, then exchanging jCHF or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap VCHF to jCHF and then to USDC to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases VCHF liquidity.\n* jCHF: jCHF main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jCHF minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets), and this is why we are launching this pool.\n\n3. Connect ecosystems: the 2chf pool connects VNX and its VCHF to the jCHF’s ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases.\n\n* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: on Polygon, VCHF can be minted from CHF and redeemed for CHF; this provides a DeFi entry and exit point for Swiss people.\n* Credit without FX risk: borrow jCHF, swap for VCHF then off-ramp VCHF.\n\n## A few notes\n\n* Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) has a position in TETU.\n* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).\n* Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield.\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1. Governance:\n\n* Jarvis: no on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (only one team member in the signers).\n  * Polygon: 0x2709fa6FA31BD336455d4F96DdFC505b3ACA5A68\n  * VNX has no on-chain governance.\n\n2. Oracles: jCHF uses CHFUSD Chainlink Price Feed.\n3. Audits:\n\n* Jarvis:[ https://learn.jarvis.network/risks-warning/audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/risks-warning/audits)\n* VNX: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CnBOk9PMyLbYMU5Nf0GgrOO4Y4h8kuRY/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CnBOk9PMyLbYMU5Nf0GgrOO4Y4h8kuRY/view)\n\n4. Centralizing vector: jCHF is mainly collateralized by USDC; VNX is backed by Swiss Francs.\n5. Market history: jCHF has been live since August 2021 (on Polygon); it has never traded off its peg. However, it has inherited from a bad debt following the hack of Midas earlier this year. As a result, 237k jCHF are not collateralized. Despite this, jCHF has held its peg. VCHF has never lost its peg.\n6. Value:\n\n* The 2chf (VCHF) pool will act as the main route on and off-ramp on Polygon for Swiss users and main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, credit without FX risks, etc.).\n\n# Contracts\n\n* 2chf pool: [0x70fF0078d55cE9C1A0E668f35eb4400a4300122D](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x70ff0078d55ce9c1a0e668f35eb4400a4300122d000000000000000000000beb)\n* 2chf gauge: [0x852580e3E1C0Fd35DE426C5481670c1772525265](https://etherscan.io/address/0x852580e3E1C0Fd35DE426C5481670c1772525265#readContract)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0x852580e3E1C0Fd35DE426C5481670c1772525265`\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon`",

        "body": "# Summary:\n\n**Enable a Balancer gauge for the BRZ - jBRL stable pool (coined 2brl) on Polygon.** \n\nBRZ and jBRL are both Brazilian Real stablecoins. BRZ is backed 1:1 by Brazilian Real (BRL) and issued by Transfero. jBRL is backed by various collateral types (BRZ, USDC, etc.).\n\nJarvis Network and Transfero co-write the proposal.\n\n\n# References/Useful links:\n\n## Jarvis Network:\nLink to:\n* Website: jarvis.network\n* Documentation: (can't put 2 link in a post because I am a new member)\n* Code: (can't put 2 link in a post because I am a new member)\n* Social: (can't put 2 link in a post because I am a new member)\n* Audits: (can't put 2 link in a post because I am a new member)\n\n## Transfero:\nLink to:\n* Websites: transfero.com\n* Social: (can't put 2 link in a post because I am a new member)\n* Audits: (can't put 2 link in a post because I am a new member)\n\n# Protocol Description:\n\n## Jarvis Network\n\nJarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.\n\nThe Synthereum protocol has four modules:\n\n* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.\n* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.\n* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.\n* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.\n\nMost jFIATs have a fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Midas), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy).\n\n### Transfero\n\nTransfero Group is an international financial solutions company based on blockchain technology in the Crypto Valley, Switzerland. Its objective is to connect emerging countries to the global market through a platform of financial solutions based on blockchain infrastructure, providing greater efficiency, flexibility, and access for people and businesses.\n\nTransfero also developed BRZ, a stablecoin backed 1:1 by Brazilian real (BRL), to give South Americans a reliable asset to the blockchain industry. The BRZ token is live on Algorand, Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Stellar. BRZ was featured in a World Economic Forum panel in 2020.\n\nBRZ is integrated with fiat on and off-ramp (BityPreco) and crypto-card solutions (Wirex) and can be borrowed and lent on money markets (Midas).\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the 2brl pool is to increase the stability of BRZ (1), the on-chain liquidity of both BRZ and jBRL (2), and connect the Transfero and Jarvis ecosystems (3). Together, these 3 points allow for building a Brazilian DeFi ecosystem.\n\n1. BRZ peg: since jBRL can be exchanged for USDC back and forth at the BRLUSD Chainlink price feed and without price impact, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and the Jarvis Liquidity Pool to help maintain the BRZ peg.\n\n2. On-chain liquidity:\n\n* BRZ: since jBRL can be exchanged for USDC without price impact, then exchanging jBRL or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap BRZ to jBRL and then to USDC to access the latter's liquidity or vice versa.\n* jBRL: jBRL main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jBRL minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets); this is why we are launching this pool as well as other pools (jBRL-USDC and jBRL-ETH, but this will be for another proposal).\n\n3. Connect ecosystems: the 2brl pool connects Transfero and its BRZ (essentially a fiat on and off-ramp for Brazilian DeFi users) to the jBRL's ecosystem, enabling multiple use cases.\n\n  * **Credit without FX risk**: borrow jBRL, swap for BRZ, then redeem BRL.\n  * **DeFi on-ramp**: use BRL to mint BRZ, then access yield or on-chain liquidity.\n  * **Remittance**: connect BRZ fiat on and off-ramp to any other jFIAT or USDC fiat on and off-ramp (we already performed payments between Brazil and Mexico and Brazil and France on the BNB Chain).\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* Jarvis LTD has started building a position in BAL and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same position.\n* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools to bribe veBAL voters (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).\n* Moving forward, we will deploy a boosted pool using Midas whenever possible to avoid fragmenting the liquidity between AMM and money markets and earn higher real yield.\n* This proposal is the first of many, as Jarvis Network is moving all their liquidity pools from Curve (stable pools) and Uniswap/Sushiswap/Kyber (volatile pools) to Balancer.\n\n# Specifications:\n \n1. Governance:\n  * Jarvis: no on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (only one team member in the signers).\n    * Polygon: 0x2709fa6FA31BD336455d4F96DdFC505b3ACA5A68\n    * Ethereum: 0x2CA74be68f0A0e053F030D143C1376806BaBEdc9\n    * Gnosis Chain: 0xaE1026699f47B1fC572D65E1784b12c3A2574A25\n    * BSC: 0x38329F26a075D53324EFd6e5F53869354Fa1cfBc\n    * Avalanche: 0x2507A0d8E2aBe9464Ba2d9ddcA38A5ee5e60A434\n    * Optimism: 0x40bd131fA9933D592344783E38f0c0F27767d9FA\n  * Transfero: centralised entity.\n2. Oracles: jBRL uses BRLUSD Chainlink price feed; BRZ token does not have a price feed\n3. Audits:\n  * Jarvis: https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MlHWTFf2MofxCAFbR4l/s/-MeLxeE9i1iOeDR_J-tQ/risks-warning/audits\n  * Transfero:\n4. Centralizing vector: jBRL is mainly collateralized by USDC; BRZ is a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a centralized entity.\n5. Market history: jBRL has been live since February 2022 (on the BNB Chain); it has traded a bit off its peg during the FTX crisis due to a too-high supply of jBRL on a money market vs. a too-low number of jBRL minted through the Liquidity Pool (the number of jBRL that you can sell in the Liquidity Pool = the number of jBRL that people has bought; so people borrow a lot of jBRLs from the Credit Line or which have been minted through the Printer, and sell them all through the Liquidity Pool, it can prevent other jBRL holders from selling jBRLs through the pool, preventing any arbitrages from happening). We have solved the issue by withdrawing jBRL from the money market, forcing users to repay their loans by buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pool. At the same time, BRZ had an issue with its peg because its primary off-chain market was on FTX, and the pool used a wrapped BRZ from Solana. Besides last week's event, both stablecoins have maintained their peg since the pool launch (on the BNB). We have learned how to prevent these situations from happening again or fix them quickly. Two other rare cases can prevent users from buying jBRL from the Liquidity Pools (again leading to preventing arbitrages from happening), and we also know how to mitigate them (currently working on it as we speak).\n6. Value:\n  * The 2brl pool will act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, credit without FX risks, etc.).\n  * It will be our first step toward moving our ecosystem to Balancer's.\n\n# Contracts\n\n* 2brl Balancer Pool (Polygon): 0xE22483774bd8611bE2Ad2F4194078DaC9159F4bA (AMP 200 because both tokens are redeemable).\n* jBRL token (Polygon): 0xf2f77FE7b8e66571E0fca7104c4d670BF1C8d722\n* jBRL (Polygon Synthereum Liquidity Pool): 0x30e97dc680ee97ff65b5188d34fb4ea20b38d710\n* BRZ token (Polygon): 0xf2f77FE7b8e66571E0fca7104c4d670BF1C8d722\n* Gauge: 0x5aeB4e367060EE08F37a7c65F57bA9f1C1895F92",

FRK is a freely transferable Interest Bearing token backed by French T-bills offering approximately 3,38% APR. The KUMA Protocol accepts to swap regulated NFTs (KUMA NFTs) backed by bonds in exchange of composable interest-bearing tokens (KIBT) based on the metadata of the NFT.\n\nPAR is crypto-backed Euro stablecoin issued by the Parallel Protocol.\n\njEUR is crypto-backed Euro stablecoin issued by the Jarvis Protocol.\n\n# Protocol Description:\n\n## KUMA Protocol\n\nThe KUMA Protocol results from the work of two distinct organizations: Mimo Capital AG and the KUMA Protocol.\n\n* Mimo Capital AG, a Liechtenstein regulated and licensed company, audited by [Grant Thornton](https://www.grantthornton.global/en/) issues tokens backed by bonds (KUMA NFTs) using NFT technology (underlying bonds are held by [Bank Frick & Co. AG](https://www.bankfrick.li/en)) to authorized individuals/companies (KYC/KYB).\n\n* The KUMA Protocol is a decentralized entity governed by vMIMO token holders that leverages these NFTs and issues KUMA interest-bearing tokens (KIBTs), which are freely transferable erc-20 tokens. These interest-bearing tokens behave similarly to stablecoins whose balance increases automatically.\n\nCurrently, 3 KIBTs are deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Mantle & Linea:\n\n* FRK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 360 days French T-Bills. (± 3,38% APR)\n* USK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFTs, themselves backed by US 12 months T-Bills. (± 4,5% APR)\n* EGK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 740 days Next.e.GO Mobile SE Corporate Bonds. (± 8,75% APR)\n\n### Parallel Protocol\n\nThe Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.\n\n### Jarvis Network\n\nJarvis Network is an ecosystem of protocols and applications to bring decentralized finance to real use cases. Its first protocol, Synthereum, allows borrowing and exchanging synthetic fiat currencies (jFIATs) on multiple EVM-compatible networks.\n\nThe Synthereum protocol has four modules:\n\n* Liquidity Pools: exchange jFIATs back and forth for USD-stablecoins or other jFIATs without price impact at the Chainlink price feed.\n* Credit Lines: borrow jFIATs against various collateral types.\n* Wrappers: convert non-USD stablecoins for their jFIATs equivalent at a 1:1 ratio.\n* Printers: mint uncollateralized jFIATs for flash loans, seeding money markets, or liquidity pools.\n\nMost jFIATs have a direct fiat on and off-ramp (Mt Pelerin, Suarmi) or indirect (Monerium, Paytrie, Transfero etc.), can be lent or borrowed on money markets (Aave, 0VIX), can be used for on-chain and off-chain payment (Request, Superfluid, Mt Pelerin) or for earning yield (Beefy).\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the p-cs-kp-eur pool is to increase the stability of PAR and wFRK (1), the on-chain liquidity of both PAR and wFRK (2), connect the Parallel and KUMA ecosystems (3) and providing a fiat gateway to PAR & wFRK holders on Polygon PoS (4). Together, these 4 points allow for building a Bonds DeFi ecosystem.\n\n1. PAR & wFRK peg:\n\n* PAR is issued following the CDP model; if PAR trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy PAR cheaper and repay their debt; if PAR trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow PAR and sell them at a higher price; since wFRK can be exchanged for Bonds NFT, and can be sold for real EURO, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and EURO market to help maintain the PAR peg; so if PAR trades below or above its peg, anyone can perform an arbitrage without having to go through a CDP.\n* wFRK is an erc-4626 wrapper of FRK. FRK is issued by using the “swap” function on the KUMA Protocol, each FRK are backed by Treasury Bonds NFT, if the peg is below the real price, KYC/KYB people are incentivized to buy FRK and redeem the NFT, if the price is above the peg, NFT holders are incentivized to mint FRK and sell them.\n\n2. On-chain liquidity:\n\n* wFRK: Since PAR can be exchanged for jEUR and wFRK which are redeemable for EUR. Users can swap PAR for wFRK and/or jEUR then EUR by buying/selling KUMA NFTs and/or redeem jEUR for EUR to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa.\n* PAR: since jEUR can be exchanged for USDC, EURe and ETH without price impact, then exchanging jEUR, ETH or USDC for any other token has the same price impact; users can swap PAR to jEUR and then to USDC or ETH to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa. This considerably increases PAR liquidity.\n* jEUR: jEUR main liquidity source is the Jarvis Liquidity Pool (primary market); without entering too many details, if the pool performs well, it will increase the number of jEUR minted, which will increase the liquidity in our Liquidity Pools and our Wrappers, which is vital to us; also, it is essential to us to have more liquidity sources (secondary markets).\n\n3. Connect ecosystems:\nThe p-cs-kp-eur (wFRK, PAR, jEUR) pool connects Parallel and its PAR (essentially a way to borrow EURO with various collateral) to KUMA and its wFRK (providing onchain FR T-bills), but also Jarvis and jEUR, enabling multiple use cases:\n\n* Credit without FX risk: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR then off-ramp jEUR (Monerium, Mt Pelerin, etc.).\n* Leverage short on EUR/XXX: borrow PAR, swap for jEUR, redeem for ETH or USDC, and repeat.\n* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: jEUR has an indirect 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium, and a direct fiat on and off-ramp through Monerium. This pool can help users to buy PAR with Euros or to sell PAR for Euros.\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* PAR & jEUR already have a gauge on Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)\n* Parallel & KUMA Protocols already have a gauge on their wUSK/paUSD/USDC pool on Ethereum: [wUSK/paUSD/USDC](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x01536b22ea06e4a315e3daaf05a12683ed4dc14c0000000000000000000005fc)\n* Jarvis LTD has started building positions in BAL, TETU and AURA. The Jarvis Network treasury (governed by the JRT token, which will soon be revamped using the ve-model, a new token called JARVIS, and an 80/20 JARVIS-ETH pool) is planning on building the same positions.\n* Jarvis LTD and the Jarvis Network treasury will both supply liquidity in the Synthereum Liquidity Pool. They will use up to 50% of the fees generated through the Liquidity Pools for vote incentives for veBAL, vlAURA, tetuBAL etc. (we have already done this successfully for a few months now on BNB Chain with Ellipsis / DotDot).\n* Mimo Labs has started building positions in AURA (310k $vlAURA & 53k $AURA) & BAL and the Parallel Protocol treasury currently holds 20k $vlAURA.\n* Mimo Labs is currently buying ±$200k AURA which will be locked to incentivize the liquidity.\n* The Parallel DAO will also pay ±$225$ voting incentives per week for the pool using the Paladin Quest vote marketplace to the pool (more details [here 1](https://gov.mimo.capital/t/mgp-14-adjust-mimo-tokens-incentives-repartition-on-ethereum-polygon-pos/292))\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1. Governance:\n\n* Parallel Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (4 team members and 4 dao members [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders).\n  * Polygon PoS: 0x2046c0416A558C40cb112E5ebB0Ca764c3C5c32a\n  * Ethereum: 0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b\n  * Fantom: 0x174162ddecE9d0b7B68fd945e38c3372C4C818ba\n* KUMA Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via snapshot) and decisions are executed through a 4/7 multi-sig (currently held by 7 team members, but a proposal to elect DAO members will take place later).\n  * Ethereum: 0xB5502747AABDCa21E832951b4caaF739dA33f450\n  * Polygon PoS: 0x1A1A402746FBe8bcFE0f7992AE27c4eD81A70156\n  * Linea: 0x1151d63eB6154843D4b4898cF4C63aF556642997\n  * Mantle: 0x37D1C94087643dFE5288F72cD1e4A6fde5b130A9\n\n2. Oracles:\n\n* jEUR uses EURUSD and computed ETHUSD (ETHUSD / EURUSD) Chainlink price feed;\n\n* PAR uses EURUSD, ([Chainlink: EUR/USD Price Feed | Address 0x73366Fe0AA0Ded304479862808e02506FE556a98 | PolygonScan 2](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x73366Fe0AA0Ded304479862808e02506FE556a98)) Chainlink price feed.\n* wFRK uses in-house build price feeds to get the rebase rate\n\n3.

Assets & Centralizing vector:\n\n* PAR has a debt limit on each collateral, is partially collateralized by USDC (≈ 30%) and the ownership of the Parallel protocol and is held by a 5/8 multisig with 4 signers from Mimo Labs and 4 signers [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders.\n* jEUR is mainly collateralized by USDC\n* wFRK is an erc-4626 wrapper of FRK. FRK is a freely transferable Interest Bearing token backed by French T-bills offering approximately 3,38% APR. The KUMA Protocol accepts to swap regulated NFTs (KUMA NFTs) backed by bonds in exchange of composable interest-bearing tokens (KIBT) based on the metadata of the NFT.\n\n5. Market history:\n\n* PAR has been live since April 2021 (on Ethereum); PAR is soft pegged to EUR\n* wFRK has been live since November 2023 (on Polygon); wFRK is an erc-4626 wrapper of FRK. wFRK accrue value according to the underlying French T-bills yield.\n* jEUR has been live since August 2021 (on Polygon); it has never traded off its peg.\n\n6. Value:\n\n* The wFRK/PAR/jEUR (p-cs-kp-eur) pool will act as the main route for arbitrages and the use cases mentioned above (on-chain liquidity, etc.).\n\n# Contracts\n\n* p-cs-kp-eur (wFRK, PAR, jEUR) Balancer Pool (Polygon): (AMP 200; trading fees 0.05%): https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x46356123e062f93d6b0d56f6ff6c3744e87c22d7000000000000000000000ca6\n* wFRK (Polygon): [0x01d1a890d40d890d59795afcce22f5adbb511a3a](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x01d1a890d40d890d59795afcce22f5adbb511a3a)\n* PAR token (Polygon): [0xe2aa7db6da1dae97c5f5c6914d285fbfcc32a128 ](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe2aa7db6da1dae97c5f5c6914d285fbfcc32a128)\n* jEUR token (Polygon): [0x4e3decbb3645551b8a19f0ea1678079fcb33fb4c](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x4e3decbb3645551b8a19f0ea1678079fcb33fb4c)\n* Gauge: [0xc4a2d0F9fC0f5828DA05e8399B4f38a345447d63](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4a2d0F9fC0f5828DA05e8399B4f38a345447d63#readContract) (root) & [0xaF9c9EB91fdb51774c6bBf2D7C07A98BEC44Dbde](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xaF9c9EB91fdb51774c6bBf2D7C07A98BEC44Dbde#code) (child)\n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xc4a2d0F9fC0f5828DA05e8399B4f38a345447d63`\ngaugeType(string): `Polygon`",
