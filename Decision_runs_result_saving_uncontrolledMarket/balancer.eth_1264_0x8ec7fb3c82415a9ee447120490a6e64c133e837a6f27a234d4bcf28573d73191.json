        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/949\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Base, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Base: 0x99aC4484e8a1dbd6A185380B3A811913Ac884D87\n\nsDAI / aUSDC Base pool on Gyro: https://app.gyro.finance/pools/base/e-clp/0x821afe819450a359e29a5209c48f2fa3321c8ad2/\n\nChild chain gauge: [https://basescan.org/address/0x6A3F93bB18fbdDea76169D3D94d03371E9e0DdC4#code]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1\n\ngaugeType(string): Base",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/918\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Optimism, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Optimism: 0x2218a117083f5B482B0bB821d27056Ba9c04b1D3\n\nsDAI/aUSDC Optimism pool on Gyro: [Gyroscope Protocol](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/optimism/e-clp/0x876e0a21626c33bdab879330505eccc6091aa607/)\n\nChild chain gauge: [[Vyper_contract | Address 0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340 | OP Mainnet Etherscan ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340)]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf\n\ngaugeType(string): Optimism",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1153\n\n**Summary:**\n\n>This proposal aims to approve the creation of a new gauge on Ethereum Mainnet with a 2% cap for APW-ETH\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website: https://spectra.finance/\n    • Documentation: https://docs.spectra.finance/ || https://dev.spectra.finance/\n    • Github Page: https://github.com/perspectivefi\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Spectra is an EVM-centric protocol for interest rate derivatives with an easy-to-use flagship app. The Spectra protocol is permissionless, meaning its services are entirely open for public use. Spectra’s Yield Token and Principal Token, minted on top of ERC-4626 interest-bearing tokens, are core protocol primitives. Spectra separates the right to principal from future yield via a process called yield tokenization. This process unlocks new financial possibilities beyond standalone interest-bearing tokens. Anyone can create new markets at will, swap yield derivatives, or become a liquidity provider. Spectra's native token, [APW](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spectra-2), powers it's flywheel tokenomics. Holders can lock APW into veAPW and use it to vote on LM, receive bribes and vote on governance proposals.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Spectra only has one primary source of liquidity and that is Balancer's APW <> ETH pool. We plan to deepen this relationship with tokenisation of Balancer Pool Tokens and veBAL liquid wrappers.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Spectra is a decentralized, community-governed protocol by the APW token holders. They can discuss, propose and vote on upgrades. Any APW holder can lock their tokens to convert into veAPW. More info on Spectra's governance can be found [here](https://app.spectra.finance/governance).\n\n2. **Oracles:** Spectra does rely on price oracles to determine price data\n\n3. **Audits:** [Audit Info](https://docs.spectra.finance/security/audits)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** None\n\n5. **Market History:** The APW/ETH pool was created approx. 7 days ago (29th of June, 2024). APW has been on the market since 18 May 2021, in that time it has not experienced sever volatility. Link to [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/spectra-2), [Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x093254005743b7af89e24f645730ba2dd8441333) and [Gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2fa29bbfd19314b3faf170dc7826ef69372203a6).\n \n6. **Value:** This is expected to be the primary pool for this token. APW liquidity mining started a couple weeks ago so users are expected to be either trading out of APW, locking it for governance or trading it into the liquid version of veAPW.\n\n**Technical Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x2fa29bbfd19314b3faf170dc7826ef69372203a6`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
