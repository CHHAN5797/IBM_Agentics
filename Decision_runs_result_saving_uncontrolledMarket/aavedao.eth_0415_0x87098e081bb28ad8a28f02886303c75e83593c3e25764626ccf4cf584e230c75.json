We propose a strategic shift towards harnessing protocol economic activity to generate \"real yield\" through the introduction of GHO as an additional Safety Incentive. \n\nBy directing part of GHO revenue to the Safety Incentives, we aim to create a dual reward system, offering stakers both AAVE and GHO tokens. While the contribution of GHO to Safety Incentives may initially be a small fraction of the total incentives, it represents a significant step towards the protocol's maturity and sustainability. \n\nThis proposal, suggests that the governance should adjust the distribution percentage quarterly, in response to market conditions.\n\nAs the Aave protocol already generates sustainable revenue that covers service provider costs, the introduction of GHO into the Safety Incentives mix is a viable and strategic move toward diversifying Safety Incentives and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protocol.\n\n### Potential Implementation\n\nWhile technicals details of the implementation will be discussed at a potential ARFC stage of this proposal, and current stage is meant to gauge community's general interest, here's a diagram of a possible implementation, redirecting GHO revenue from Collector contract (dao treasury) to a splitter contract controlled by governance.\n\n![image|2000x1028](upload://beyTiZ0BzFAVqdN2btMmu855a04.png)\n\n### Initial Parameters\n\nWe propose to set a potential \"Gho Splitter\" contract with\n- 80% toward COLLECTOR contract (Aave DAO treasury)\n- 20% toward REWARDS_VAULT (controlling safety incentives)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage for service provider feedback and implementation discussions.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] TokenLogic Hohmann Transfer\nauthor: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\ncreated: 2023-10-05\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC proposes the inclusion of TokenLogic in the \"Orbit\" delegate platform initiative for a period of 90 days, with a monthly compensation of 5k GHO and total budget of 15k GHO.\n\n## Motivation\nTokenLogic has been an active and valuable participant in the Aave ecosystem. While they were initially eligible and considered for the Orbit program, they opted to explore the possibility of becoming a service provider to the DAO. However, given their recent decision to re-organize internally and re-evaluate their proposed scope as a service provider, it's appropriate to reconsider their inclusion in the Orbit program.\n\n## Specification\n\n### TokenLogic Inclusion\n\n- TokenLogic will be recognized as an official delegate within the Orbit program for a period of 90 days.\n- They will receive a monthly compensation of 5k GHO, totaling 15k GHO over the three-month period.\n\n### Funding and Emissions\n\nTokenLogic's compensation will be in line with the Orbit program's guidelines, ensuring fairness and consistency with other delegates.\n\n### Responsibilities and Conditions\n\n- TokenLogic will actively participate in Aave governance, representing their delegators and contributing to the protocol's growth.\n- If TokenLogic presents and successfully passes a proposal to become a service provider to the DAO, their Orbit funding stream will be terminated to prevent double compensation.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The inclusion of TokenLogic is based on their merits and contributions to the Aave community.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
