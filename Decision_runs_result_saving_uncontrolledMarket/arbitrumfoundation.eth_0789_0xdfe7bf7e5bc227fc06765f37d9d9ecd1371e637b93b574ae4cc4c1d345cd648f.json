        "body": "Please find the full proposal on the forums, several sections have been removed to adhere to character limits: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-fund-the-stylus-sprint/26437?u=entropy\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe [ArbOS 31 “Bianca”](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/108288822474129076868455956066667369439381709547570289793612729242368710728616) onchain vote on Tally has passed quorum, signaling the DAO’s approval to activate Arbitrum Stylus on Arbitrum One and Nova. To bolster the impact of this upgrade, this proposal presents the one-time \"Stylus Sprint\" program, aimed at encouraging the early development of Stylus smart contracts and tooling by awarding up to 5,000,000 ARB to teams who build with Stylus. Applications will be open for 8 weeks and the program will run for 1 year. The Sprint will include a mix of open applications where teams are encouraged to be creative in their ideas as well as invitational/RFQs with strategically targeted objectives. The requested funding is intended to cover development costs, including hiring talent, training teams, adopting new tools, infrastructure expenses, and audits at the discretion of the recipient. This campaign's primary objectives are to engage new and existing Arbitrum protocol teams with this novel technology, showcase use cases only feasible with Stylus, and create foundational Stylus building blocks for widespread use.\n\nInterested teams must apply through a designated application process and grant recipients will be selected by an Evaluation Committee based on specific criteria detailed in this proposal. As the program progresses, participating teams will receive staged funding as they reach predefined and agreed-upon milestones, culminating in the deployment and long-term upkeep of their projects.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Application Process & RFP Details:\n\nAs mentioned, the Stylus Sprint program invites teams to submit applications either in the open-applications track or in response to lightweight Request for Proposals (RFPs, listed below) that target specific verticals, published by the Evaluation Committee. The below lists are non-exhaustive and serve as inspiration. Participants in the open track will have ample opportunity for innovation and creativity. All requests for both the open-application track and RFPs must be denominated in ARB.\n\nThe application approach described above for both open applications and RFPs ensures a structured yet flexible framework for harnessing the potential of Stylus technology. Not all funds will necessarily be deployed, and even if an RFP has quotes, there is no guarantee that any will be deemed satisfactory and chosen. The above categories are non-exhaustive and meant to be viewed as examples. If this proposal passes, the Evaluation Committee will cement an official list before applications open.\n\nTeams are required to submit a detailed application outlining their plans for utilizing the funding. These applications will be thoroughly reviewed by the Evaluation Committee, which will also approve them. Upon approval, milestone payments will be systematically allocated to the teams based on their progress. If no satisfactory applications are received, as decided at the discretion of the Evaluation Committee, 0 ARB will be spent, and all unspent funds will be returned to DAO.\n\n### Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors\n\nTo effectively administer the program, it is essential to establish an Evaluation Committee composed of Stylus experts. Additionally, a group of advisors will provide consultative support to the committee. Given the innovative nature and specific technical nuances of Stylus, we propose that the committee be primarily made up of members from Offchain Labs and OpenZeppelin, the two entities responsible for developing Stylus thus far. Currently, there are limited experts qualified to assess Stylus applications effectively. However, should the DAO prefer to engage in a broader selection process that we believe would be inefficient and lead to a less successful program, Entropy Advisors is more than happy to facilitate an RFP process instead, contingent upon a DAO vote to define and appoint these roles.\n\nEvaluation Committee\n\n1. Stylus Team Members - Offchain Labs (Waiving Payment)\n2. Dev Team - Arbitrum Foundation (Waiving Payment)\n3. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n4. Michael Lewellen - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n5. Gustavo Gonzalez - OpenZeppelin (5000 ARB per month)\n\nCommittee Advisors\n\n1. Entropy Advisors (Waiving Payment)\n\nThe Committee Advisors’ main role will be facilitating discourse with the DAO, applicants, and general project management in order to reduce the burden on the Evaluation Committee where possible. **Members of the Evaluation Committee and Committee Advisors will not be eligible to apply to the program in any capacity due to conflicts of interest.**\n\nJudges and Advisors will serve for approximately 14.5 months. In the first 2 weeks, they will work together to refine the application and evaluation criteria as well as specifics around the RFPs to kickstart the process. The following 2 months will be used to review proposals as they come in. Subsequent 2 weeks will be taken to officially accept and reject projects. **Both accepted and rejected applications will receive public rationale from the Evaluation Committee as to why the choice was made so that the DAO may have a view into the decisions and the teams can adjust accordingly in the future.** In the next 12 months, contributors will greenlight milestone payments as projects achieve their goals and periodically give guidance to participants. Advisors will report back to the DAO through monthly updates over the lifespan of the program.\n\n### Multisig Setup\n\nThe Stylus Sprint multi-sig will be created and allocated 5M ARB for the Stylus Sprint Program and 150K ARB for payments to judges. Funds will be sent to an MSS-secured multisig. The funds in the multisig belong to the DAO and the signers act as grant managers on behalf of the DAO in coordination with the Arbitrum Foundation. Funds held in the multisig are explicitly banned from usage in DAO governance, including delegation.\n\n### Funding Levels and Disbursement\n\nTeams will apply for their appropriate levels of funding. Suggested levels in ARB are 1M, 750K, 500K, 250K, 100K, or 50K. If teams want a different amount of funding, they must specify why in their application. These funding levels have been set to streamline the review process. However, teams are encouraged to request specific amounts of funding best suited to their needs. Teams will have 1 year to deploy their project and meet their 2 post-deployment milestones.\n\nUnallocated funds will be returned to the DAO treasury after all applications have been reviewed and grant sizes have been determined. An additional dispersal to the DAO could occur if projects don’t manage to hit their goals within the 1-year timeline and if the budget has remaining ARB. There is absolutely no need to allocate all funds, and it will only be done if more than 5M in exemplary proposals are received during the 8-week application cycle.\n\nFunding will be distributed based on achieving certain development milestones. 50% of funds will be distributed after deployment to encourage teams to think about growth and sustainability post-launch. The criteria for these 2 checkpoints will be proposed by teams in their applications.\n\nAll projects will be required to use milestones in order to ensure progress is being made before funds are fully allocated. The above milestone structure, however, is not required. For RFPs, custom milestone payments can be included in the quotes provided by service providers. Approved projects will submit requests as they reach milestones. The judges, with help from their advisors, will be responsible for ensuring validity and greenlighting payment to be sent as milestones are hit, in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria mentioned above. The evaluation committee will have the autonomy and authority to expel projects from the program at any point in their life cycle and stop all future milestone payments.\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. Stylus Sprint Forum Post - August 20, 2024\n2. Snapshot Vote Begins - August 29, 2024\n3. On-Chain Vote - Sept 12, 2024\n6. Stylus Sprint Begins - Oct 4, 2024\n\nThe program will begin on the Monday following the onchain proposal’s passing. The first 2 weeks will be used to refine and post the RFPs, followed by open applications for 8 weeks, then a 2-week application review process. Feedback between the Evaluation Committee and applicants will be conducted on an ongoing/continuous basis over the next 10 weeks. KYC with the foundation will then begin and first milestone payments may be allocated upon completion. The MSS chairs, Arbitrum Foundation, and Entropy Advisors will need to work closely to ensure a strict payment process.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\n**5,180,000 ARB**\n\nUp to 5M to be awarded to projects building on Stylus\n\n75,000 ARB payment in total over 14.5 months per committee member for 2 committee members = 150,000 ARB\n\n30,000 ARB paid up front to Questbook.",

        "body": "# Improving Predictability in Arbitrum DAO’s Operations\n\n#### Non Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce guidelines for posting proposals to a vote; primarily to reduce delegate fatigue by ensuring that Snapshot and Tally votes are posted at a regular cadence with greater predictability. Rather than formally updating the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, the chosen guidelines can be seen as a common social agreement between delegates. This proposal carries no cost to the DAO, and the guidelines can be implemented by the start of August if passed through a Snapshot vote.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince its inception, the Arbitrum DAO has voted on over 280 Snapshots and 30 onchain votes. First anticipated almost a [year](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-1-time-management-in-arbitrumdao-governance/15718) ago by Cattin and Seedlatam, as the operations of the DAO continue to grow, a more efficient and predictable governance process is needed to prevent delegate fatigue.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur team considered several possibilities for structuring Arbitrum DAO’s governance processes. This included creating voting periods organized around a monthly calendar or continuously repeating three week cycles. While both of those structures would greatly increase predictability and allow for the possibility of predetermined rest periods, they each come with tradeoffs:\n\n* Condensing the availability of when a proposal can be posted to a vote creates an incentive to rush proposals. This can be detrimental to overall proposal quality.\n* There is the potential to induce delegate fatigue if there is an overwhelming amount of votes all pushed into one short period.\n  * Limiting the number of votes in each batch opens up further questions on how to prioritize which proposals are included.\n* The DAO has typically [seen](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915) a 14 day application window for RFPs. Ensuring elections begin in a timely manner post RFP is an additional consideration that adds complexity to any designed structure.\n\nPrevious conversations on the DAO’s process have also included introducing [standard guidelines for elections](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-create-a-standardized-guideline-for-non-security-council-elections/20915) or an Arbitrum Delegate Code of Conduct. These are topics that Entropy Advisors is beginning to work on as well, but in this case we believe it is better to start by leaning on the side of simplicity.\n\nKnowing that more complex structures can always be implemented later, below we propose the adoption of a set day each week for votes to start as well as a holiday break. Both of these would greatly increase predictability for delegates and can be adopted by the DAO without much of an adjustment period.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThis proposal does not seek to alter the language of the Arbitrum DAO Constitution, but rather create an agreed upon social contract between delegates on best practices in regards to posting proposals to a Snapshot or Tally vote.\n\nOur primary objective is to improve predictability and reduce the potential for delegate fatigue. Based on these priorities below are specifications for the two recommended adjustments to Arbitrum DAO’s governance processes.\n\n### Start all votes on Thursdays\n\nBy starting both Snapshot and Tally votes on Thursday, the DAO can not only increase predictability for delegates, but also prevent the scenario where votes begin/end on weekends.\n\nIn order for a Tally vote to start on Thursday, it must be posted on Monday given the 3-day delay from when a proposal is posted until voting begins. Each batch of proposals ready to move to a Snapshot vote can be scheduled beforehand beginning on Monday and through Wednesday. We encourage delegates to post/schedule votes to begin before Thursday at 12 pm UTC. While not a hard deadline, this will help ensure any votes start for a majority of delegates worldwide.\n\nOverall, this allows delegates who don’t follow discussions as closely a few days to see what will be voted on and properly prepare. Additionally, with multiple opportunities each month to move a proposal forward to a vote, the incentive to rush the process is reduced.\n\n### Holiday Break: December 20 - January 6th\n\nImplement a holiday break to ensure delegates have a break and can return refreshed for the new year. During this time it is advised that no new proposals are posted to the forums and only emergency proposals are put up to a vote.\n\n### Optional: Delegate Approval Process\n\nRecently, we have noticed a trend within Arbitrum DAO of delegates waiting until a proposal makes it to a Snapshot for feedback to be given. This has resulted in some proposals being posted to Snapshot prematurely. We assume this is a result of several factors including the increasing amount of topics delegates must stay up to date on and the fact that there are no specific guidelines on how much discussion is required before moving a proposal forward.\n\nIt would likely be very difficult to achieve DAO wide consensus on what specific requirements should be implemented to determine when a proposal is ready to move to a Snapshot vote. Thus a level of subjectivity is required and taking inspiration from procedures within Optimism DAO, a delegate approval process can be adopted.\n\nThere are currently 64 delegates with greater than 500k in voting power (VP), so our recommended threshold for delegate approval is 4 delegates. Once a proposal obtains this threshold it can be considered that there is consensus among enough delegates that it is ready to move forward.\n\nTo signal their support of a proposal, delegates can post a statement similar to the following: “I am an Arbitrum delegate with xx voting power and believe this proposal is ready to move forward to Snapshot”. Delegates should also link their Tally profile so that it is easy to verify their VP.\n\nThis approach introduces its own set of tradeoffs. While it would likely prevent premature proposals from going to a Snapshot vote, it does increase delegate responsibilities and can risk proposals authored by new contributors getting stuck due to the lack of connections to large delegates. Therefore we are presenting this as an option separate from the aforementioned adoptions and would welcome feedback from the community.\n\nTo help encourage delegates to take on this additional responsibility, as part of the [delegate incentive program](https://arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/) a bonus point can be awarded to delegates on Karma who approve a proposal that eventually passes on Snapshot or Tally. This is just a suggestion and something we will leave to the discretion of the Seed Latam team.\n\n### Additional Considerations: Emergency Proposals\n\nIn the event of an emergency proposal that is time-sensitive in nature we recommend that any adopted guidelines be waived and the proposal be put up to a vote immediately. In our opinion, only Constitutional AIPs that relate to security matters should be considered as emergency proposals.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nAny changes made to the DAO’s procedures need to be widely communicated and accessible for potential new members. Otherwise, there are minimal steps needed to implement other than coordinating delegates and helping the DAO adjust to the adopted changes.\n\nEntropy will also be responsible for:\n\n* Adding the agreed upon guidelines to the [Ground Rules Topic](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/ground-rules/10) so that it is easy for new community members to discover and access. Our team will coordinate with the Foundation to make this happen.\n* Adding the holiday break to the Arbitrum DAO [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_4157985d2452dfd8a91b6a36bccab37deb9bffe9053a4b9bcc4e9fff9ef02924%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).\n\n## Timeline\n\nBelow is a proposed timeline to help ensure a smooth transition and adequate preparation for all delegates and community members.\n\n#### Feedback Period (June 24th - July 11th)\n\nTaking into account GovHack (July 5-7) and EthCC (8-11), we have proposed a longer feedback period so as to not hold a vote when several delegates will be traveling. These events also present an opportunity to gather additional feedback in person.\n\n#### Snapshot: July 11th - 18th\n\n#### Voting Options: Ranked Choice\n\n* FOR: Improving Predictability\n* FOR: Improving Predictability and Delegate Approval Process\n* AGAINST\n* ABSTAIN\n\n#### Preparation Period: July 18th - July 28th\n\nAssuming the proposal passes the Snapshot vote, preparation for the first batch of proposals to align with the new schedule. We recommend that no Snapshot votes are posted after July 21st to help ensure a smooth transition for the first batch to begin August 1st.\n\n#### First Tally Votes Scheduled: July 29th\n\n#### First Batch of Snapshot Votes: August 1st\n\n## Costs\n\nThere are no additional costs to the DAO for implementing this proposal. The primary resources required will be the time required to update and coordinate with delegates on whatever new schedule is decided upon. This will be handled by the Entropy Advisors team.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe wanted to also extend our gratitude to Cattin and the Seed Latam team for providing valuable feedback and assistance with this proposal.",

        "body": "Note: This proposal has been posted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created program to distribute up to 75,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through the January 31, 2024. It asks all participating grantees to self report data, and dashboards, summarizing grant performance.\n\n**Motivation**\nThis provisional framework aims to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed (1 19, 2 7, 3 4, 4 5).\nThe goals of the program are to:\n•\tSupport Network Growth: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n•\tExperiment with Incentive Grants: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n•\tFind new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n•\tCreate Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n**Rationale**\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n**Specifications**\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 75,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n \n![8b05a5d34faf8659a144f1d35081a89ae83e237e.png](ipfs://bafkreiaizvrpzwo5bn6lxl5ikdywhfakyphtdukgkywpuzpvlrokaaj2oe)\n     \nFollowing a successful Snapshot Temperature Check, the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check will be designed to both achieve consensus and approve funding across four options, where each vote will distinguish support of up to X ARB through the end of January 31, 2024:\n•\tFor up to **25M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **50M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **75M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tAgainst.\n\n**Financial Proposal**\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n•\tA ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and application template 37 as articulated in this document.\n•\tApproval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n•\tA 25,000,000, 50,000,000 or 75,000,000 ARB distribution to the program Multisig.\n•\tA 32,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\no\t20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n\tDraft and review of multiple iterations of incentive proposals.\n\tModeration of community calls and working group telegram.\n\tCoordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\no\t12,000 ARB Multisig Signers (A new version of the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig 17 - 2K per signer).\n\n**Multisig Setup**\nA new multisig will be created with the signers from the original pl-ARB multisig, under the name of the Arbitrum DAO. The new multisig will include two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1.\tClawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2.\tStreaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n**What are the Eligibility Requirements?**\n\nGrant Requirements:\n•\tGrantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n•\tGrantees must not farm their own incentive programs.\n•\tGrantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n•\tGrantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard or alternatively in a report.\n•\tGrantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n•\tGrantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n•\tGrantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n•\tGrants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n•\tGrantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n•\tGrantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n•\tGrantees must apply using the approved program application template 15.\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n•\tAny use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n•\tFailure to comply with data reporting standards.\no\tGrantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n•\t•\tDashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n•\t•\tMore granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\no\tIf dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n**Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines**\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there’s no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n•\t**Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $1.5M TVL.\n\t.>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $4M TVL.\n\t.>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n\t.> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n\tMeets one of the following criteria\n\t.> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n\t.> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\n*Grants greater than $1M ARB will be asked to include milestone-based funding tranches in their application.\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n**Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?**\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\nCycle 1\n1.\tApplication Period (1 Week):\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application Template 20.\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2.\tReview Period (1 Week):\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3.\tVoting Period (1 Week):\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the PL-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\nCycle 2\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n**Timeline**\n[See image above]\nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 09, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\n\nCycle 1\nSep. 16, 2023 - On-Chain Vote and Application Period\nSep. 23, 2023 - Review Period Begins\nSep. 30, 2023 - Voting Round Begins\nOct. 07, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\nCycle 2\nOct 07, 2023 - Application Period 2 Begins\nOct 14, 2023 - Review Period 2 Begins\nOct 28, 2023 - Voting Round 2 Begins\nNov. 04, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\n**Overall Cost**\nUp to 75,032,000 ARB.\n\n**Outstanding Questions and Concerns**\n\nWhat happens if the budget is exceeded?\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 75M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\nWhat will happen to excess funds?\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\nWhat is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of allowing incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\nWhat are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?\n•\tCommunity Support: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n•\tNetwork Activity: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n•\tCommunity Awareness: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n•\tIncentives Data: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n**Forum Link **\n\nThis snapshot is replication of the forum post.

        "body": "# ArbitrumDAO Off-site\n\nNon-Constitutional\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the directional proposal for an offsite which was voted in favour with 130mn ARB in Snapshot: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrumdao-off-site-directional-proposal/25660\n\nIMPORTANT:\nPlease vote based on the format selection. If you have concerns about the mechanism to define attendees or specific budget items (e.g. travel scholarships), please use a comment. Feel free to explain that any Tally approval vote would be conditional on XYZ. The vote I'm trying to focus it on the format selection.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the alignment, communication, and collaboration among token holders (including delegates) and key stakeholders by organizing a dedicated off-site event. The DAO currently struggles with achieving cohesive strategies due to sporadic interactions and a lack of direct engagement among key participants. To address this, a structured event will be organized in Q4, focusing on strategic alignment and problem-solving sessions.\n\n\nThis proposal includes a delegates and key stakeholders outreach and sense-making process to prioritise the most important agenda items to be discussed at the evente, ensuring the meeting time is focused on discussing the topic and not on discussing what to discuss or how to approach it. The event will then include professional facilitation to advance alignment, remove blockers, ensure proper note-taking, and generate clear action items on the selected topics.\n\n\nThe success of this initiative will be measured quantitatively by the NPS given by participants, and qualitatively by the outcomes and outputs from the sessions.\n\n\n## The Problem\n\n\nThe DAO encounters multiple challenges, but a critical issue is the lack of effective communication and alignment among delegates and key stakeholders. This results in fragmented strategies and slow decision-making processes. Important decisions and proposals often suffer due to inadequate collaboration and understanding among the members.\n\n\nAreas such as organizational design and strategic planning require not only well-crafted proposals but also thorough stakeholder engagement. We’re missing structured platforms for delegates and key stakeholders to engage deeply and collaboratively, leading to bottlenecks and slow and painful decision-making.\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to test a format for deliberation between key stakeholders with a clearly defined agenda. If successful, the format can be replicated to continuously address agenda items.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n\nRecent initiatives like the Delegates Day by Entropy and GovHack in Brussels highlight the potential for focused events to catalyse progress. We want to build on these learnings to advance the ArbitrumDAO. The proposal includes:\n\n\n1. Agenda prioritisation (pre-event strategic aligment)\n\n\n* Project manager to engage with token holders, delegates, and key stakeholders, distilling concerns and topic suggestions, and facilitating converging on the agenda. Including snapshot vote for agenda and format.\n* Careful planning of each session: aiming to share and agree on frameworks and approaches in advance, focusing IRL discussion on content and not format.\n* Defining criteria for attendees in consultation with key stakeholders to ensure both a successful event and capture resistance for the DAO.\n\n\n2. Facilitation & Workshop Organization:\n\n\n* Either IRL event or Online workshops (to be decided by this vote)\n* Structured facilitation process to ensure effective discussion, note-taking, and converging to action items.\n\n\n3. Post workshop follow up\n\n\n* Sharing a summary of the discussion & agreed action points\n* Follow up with participants a month after the workshop to track progress on action items and liaison with Entropy, Foundation, and other parties to suggest next steps as appropriate.\n\n\nOptional (see voting options):\n\n\n* Travel and Accommodation:\n  * Accommodation and catering for attendees and organisers.\n  * Travel expenses for attendees not already funded by the DAO for travel expenses and not otherwise in the region (e.g. not attending DevCon nor DevCon side events).\n  * Travel expenses “scholarship” available for attendees upon request and subject to approval by the event coordinator.\n\n\n## Timeline:\n\n\n* September: proposal approval and then logistics planning and preparation.\n* Event to take place during Q4, exact date depending on the snapshot vote (see below)\n* Before end of Q4: Post-event reporting and follow-up.\n\n\n## What Does Success Look Like?\n\n\n* High-quality outcomes and actionable strategies from workshops.\n* Increased engagement and satisfaction among participants.\n* Positive feedback and a strong desire to continue similar initiatives.\n\n\n## KPIs:\n\n\n* 50%+ participation rate among engaged ([35%+ on-chain voting rate](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates)) Top50 delegates, foundation, and off-chain labs.\n* NPS of 50 or more (-100 to 100 range, 0 considered average)\n* A similar initiative is organised again.\n\n\n## Options\n\n\n3 options are proposed. Please vote for the preferred one.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: the costs are not finalised but are here as an indicative so the best option can e selected. Once an option is selected we'll review the costs before moving to Tally. If you have any feedback on the costs, please share it with Daniel (@mrjackalop on Telegram) so it can be taken into account before the final onchain proposal.\n\n\n**Option 1: IRL version next to a major event:** \n\n\n* Next to DevCon Thailand, November 8th-10th.\n* 2-day event: day 1 arrival and facilitated dinner light discussion. Day 2 workshops. Day 3 breakfast and departure.\n* Including setup for hybrid participation (online participants supported with 360 cameras, moderator, and tech support)\n* Includes 20k travel scholarships for those not already in the region\n\n\naround $116k + 10k contingency\n\n\n**Option 2: IRL version separate from major event:**\n\n\n* In the most travel-friendly location for participants\n* During December 2024\n* 2-day event (same as above)\n* Including setup for hybrid participation (same as above)\n* Includes $50k travel for those not already in the region\n\n\naround $156k + 10k contingency\n\n\n**Option 3: Online Event:** \n* 3-4 online sessions (half-day sessions) over 1-2 months. With the possibility of input and feedback before/after event to ensure even those not attending can participate effectively.\n* During October-December 2024 (November likely skipped)\n\n\n around $35k + 5k contingency.\n\n\n\n\n[Detailed breakdown and comparison here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_pdVwma1ja8k0If2c_Fv8u36ZatVP_8SS24XGO5Cgs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n**Notes on budget**:\n\n\n* high-level calculations. The budget will be revised in more detail (by requesting a quote from providers, etc.) after a successful Snapshot vote.\n* Any funds unspent will be returned to the DAO.\n* Funds will be denominated in ARB for tally vote\n\n\n\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n\n### Facilitation\n\n\nThe opportunity cost of this meeting is easily 10x its budget, given the limited time availability of delegates and few occasions a year when they converge. As such, good facilitation makes a critical difference in ensuring the meeting is effective. The facilitation includes designing the workshops and moderating the conversation, AND thinking through how to create a strategic process for a DAO.\nCosts of Online facilitation might be lower than IRL. We'll confirm this before the onchain proposal, for now costs are indicative to select a direction.\n\n\n### Agenda\n\n\nWe’ve already started the process of setting the agenda. We ran a survey, answered by 29 delegates with 86mn+ ARB represented. And then ran SimScore (a collective intelligence algorithm) to cluster responses and identify the key topics. The results are presented below to encourage further discussion.\n\n\nPre-selection of topics (to be refined and prioritised after the format is defined):\n* Defining strategic priorities for the DAO (vision and strategy)\n* DAO Budget (how much should the DAO be spending)\n* Org Design\n* ARB token utility\n* Conflict Of Interest\n* Grant programs (RPGF, what should be the focus, outcomes, etc.)\n\n\nAdditional work to be done to define the agenda:\n\n\n* 2 workshops and async discussion to identify root causes (root topics) and prioritise.\n* The final agenda will be defined via a subsequent Snapshot vote facilitated by the project manager.\n\n\n### Hybrid Participation for IRL events\n\n\nWe’ve successfully run a company retreat with hybrid participation (online+IRL). The setup works through using 360 cameras (equipped with a special mic, they cost about $600) and having an assistant with a laptop who can also support online participants in being heard (getting a turn to speak) and managing technical difficulties. The online setup is of course less good than being IRL but it is still viable to contribute to sessions (anyone leading a session does need to be IRL but, for input in the discussion, online works).\n\n\n### Attendees\n\n\n* Focused on high-context, expert, and senior participants. I.e. not an onboarding event.\n* Open to [Top-50 delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/delegates), off-chain labs, foundation members, and top 100 ARB token holders (both in Arbitrum One and Ethereum).\n* Additional attendees based on at least 20 million ARB endorsements (holders/delegates can endorse as many participants as desired).\n\n### Voting OPTIONS\n\nFormat: **ranked choice**\n\nOptions (due to Snapshots constraints the actual options available are shortened):\n1. RL event next to major conference (with travel scholarships for those not in the region) \n2. IRL event separate from major conference (with travel scholarships for those not in the region)\n3. IRL event next to major conference (NO travel scholarships)\nIRL event separate from major conference (NO travel scholarships)\n4. Online event(s)\n5. I believe we shouldI drop this and dedicate attention somewhere else\n6. Abstain",

        "body": "This is a temperature check to gauge the DAO's overall opinion on creating official conflict of interest and self-voting policies. No social contract, guidelines, or policy will be adopted directly from the result of this vote. \n\nPlease find the full proposal on the forums, certain sections such as Enforcement and Timeline have been removed to adhere to character limits: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/should-the-dao-create-coi-self-voting-policies/26062\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to restart the conversation around the creation of self-voting and conflict of interests policies. The proposal outlines various options, ranging from maintaining the status quo to enforcing strict self-voting policies. A Snapshot vote to gauge the DAO's sentiment will be posted on Thursday, August 15th. Please note, this is an **actual temperature check**, just to gauge the DAO’s opinion on the subject. Based on the results, certain policies may be included in a future delegate of code of conduct as part of an effort to professionalize the DAO’s operations.\n\n## Background\n\nStrict policies regarding conflicts of interest (COI) and self-dealing are standard practices in traditional corporate industries. However, with crypto just now emerging from an early stage, entirely avoiding conflict of interests is challenging. Many individuals are either investors, employees, or contributors across multiple companies/protocols on not only Arbitrum, but other L1/L2 chains.\n\nSeveral other DAOs have established a code of conduct in an attempt to address these issues. Examples range from being opt-in recommendations ([Uniswap](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-delegate-code-of-conduct/20913)), simple pledges ([Maker](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/recognised-delegate-code-of-conduct/9384), [Gitcoin](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/about-gitcoin/code-of-conduct), [Aave](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-delegate-code-of-conduct/12981)), and strict no self-dealing policies & expectations enforced by a council and violations resulting in suspension from the DAO’s platforms (Optimism: [Code of Conduct Committee](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-code-of-conduct-rescoping-2/8101), [Optimist Expectations](https://gov.optimism.io/t/optimist-expectations/7241)).\n\nWhile Arbitrum has standard [rules of engagement](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/community-guidelines/12807?u=pruitt) for the forums, it currently lacks a delegate code of conduct in addition to an official policy on conflicts of interest. The only mention of the term in the Arbitrum [Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution) is in relation to candidate eligibility for the Security Council.\n\nCreating a self-voting policy was first [raised](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886/8) by @Immutablelawyer at the beginning of 2024 following the LTIPP council elections. While the post resulted in a good discussion, many delegates at the time indicated a strong preference to not move forward with any policy that restricted a delegate’s ability to vote. Thus a temperature check to gather the larger DAO’s sentiment on this issue never occurred.\n\nIn recent weeks, the topic has reemerged in conversations, and as part of a series of proposals focusing on professionalizing the Arbitrum DAO’s operations, Entropy Advisors is looking to restart the conversation on a proposed self-voting and COI policy in order to reach a definite consensus. Policies that are voted are favored by the DAO will be included in a future delegate code of conduct proposal.\n\n## Rationale\n\nWe would argue that within a DAO’s operations, the majority of instances involving COI are the result of an individual/company using their delegated voting power to engage in self-voting or “self-enrichment”. This can exist when a delegate votes for themselves to get elected to a committee, thereby receiving financial gain, or a delegate votes in favor of a proposal that directly benefits themselves or their company. There are certainly other situations where COI can arise such as oversight, but for the purposes of this proposal, the focus is centered on the practice of self-voting.\n\nFor clarity and the purposes of this conversation we will lean on the definitions that @Immutablelawyer established back when the topic of self-voting was previously [discussed](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/self-voting-policy-discussion-arbitrumdao-constitution/20886).\n\n* **Conflicts of Interest:** A situation where a token-holder or their close-associates stand to directly benefit from the outcome of a proposal.\n* **Self-Voting:** The practice of where token holders use their voting power to vote on proposals that involve or benefit themselves.\n* **Self-Enrichment (Self-Dealing):** The act of increasing or enhancing one’s own personal financial wealth as a result of one's own vote.\n\nAs mentioned above, the majority of comments indicated that it was unwise to restrict a delegate’s ability to vote in any manner. To paraphrase the discussion, hesitation to implement a self-voting policy boiled down to primarily two reasons:\n\n* **Philosophical Objections:** Delegates are entrusted by token holders to best represent their own values and interests. Forcing a delegate to abstain from a vote due to COI concerns prevents the delegate from truly representing their base’s interests and thus disenfranchises the token holders delegating.\n* **Lack of Enforceability:** Even if self-voting was monitored manually by contributors or a committee, it is quite easy to circumvent self-voting policies onchain by simply transferring voting power to anonymous wallets. To quote @DisruptionJoe, in general, “unenforceable rules create situations where bad actors have an advantage over good actors''.\n\nWhile both are strong objections, there are positives to implementing COI and self-voting policies. First, they help establish the “rules of the game”, so that every participant in Arbitrum governance is operating under the same set of expectations. Furthermore, disclosure requirements can help lead to greater transparency while also incentivizing participants to act in an ethical manner. Most importantly, with such policies standard practice in other industries, Arbitrum DAO can improve its image as a professional organization by holding its actors to similar standards.\n\n## Specifications\n\nBelow are a few policy options the DAO can adopt to help address and mitigate COI and self-voting. The options are presented from least restrictive (do nothing) to what we view as the most restrictive.\n\n**Keep the Status Quo:** Arbitrum DAO can continue to operate as it has been. A delegate code of conduct does not need to include specific policies on disclosure or self-voting.\n\n**Disclosure and Transparency Policy:** If a potential COI exists, it is expected that proposal authors or delegates disclose the nature and extent of the interest. While it may not always be clear if an individual stands to gain “directly” or “indirectly”, it is recommended to lean on the side of over-communication in the name of transparency. Delegates are not expected to abstain or alter their voting preferences in any way, but are free to choose to abstain.\n\n**“Responsible Voting” Policy in Elections:** In an election with multiple seats, candidates may vote for themselves as long as they also cast votes to fill the remaining positions. Put more simply, a candidate should not cast a vote solely for themselves in an election. In the case of a weighted voting election, the candidate's weight for themself should not be larger than the weights for other candidate. To the best of their ability they should strive to make the weights as equal as possible among the number of candidates necessary to fill each position. \n\n* Example: I am running in the GCP council election, which has 3 open seats. I can vote for my own candidacy, but must also cast 2 additional votes for other candidates.\n\nThis is a policy that has worked well in other DAOs and helps address the natural incentive to withhold votes for competing candidates in an election while also making sure token-holders are not disenfranchised.\n\nCredit to @JoJo for the term “Responsible Voting”.\n\n**Strict Self-Voting Policy:** In the event of a conflict of interest, under the simple definitions stated in the Rationale above, it is expected that a delegate or proposal author abstains during the voting process. In the event that \"Abstain\" is not presented as a voting option, it is expected that the delegate votes in a neutral manner as to not impact the results of the vote. For example, in an election a delegate may even divide their voting power in equal weight to effectively abstain. This policy would include candidates being prevented from self-voting in elections and delegates from voting on proposals that directly benefit oneself, company, or interests.\n\n### Voting Choices\n\nThe temperature check on Snapshot will use [approval voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/user-guides/proposals/voting-types). Each delegate can select any number of choices, each selected choice will receive equal voting power. So for example, if a delegate wishes to see the DAO adopt both a disclosure policy and responsible voting, then they should select both options on the Snapshot vote.\n\nSince this is a proposal that changes the DAO’s current status quo, the following choices have been worded in a manner that each “FOR” vote indicates desire to adopt a certain policy.",
