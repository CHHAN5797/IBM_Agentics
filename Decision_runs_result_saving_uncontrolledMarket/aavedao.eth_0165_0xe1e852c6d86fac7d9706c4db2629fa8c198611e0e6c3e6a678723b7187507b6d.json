        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Set ACI as Emission Manager for Liquidity Mining Programs \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-06\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThe current ARFC proposes to appoint the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) as the Emission Manager for liquidity mining programs across Aave markets. This will enable ACI to manage incentive programs funded by different partners, with the purpose of stimulating market activity and growth.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nLiquidity mining programs are essential for attracting liquidity providers by offering rewards for their participation. Effective management of these programs is crucial for the sustained growth of the Aave Ecosystem. Therefore, ACI, with its extensive experience and strategic partnerships, is well-positioned to manage these emissions effectively.\n\nA recent example is the [Long Term Incentive Program (LTIPP)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741) from Arbitrum DAO, where Aave DAO will receive 750,000 ARB tokens, illustrating the benefits of coordinated emission management.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n1. Appointment of ACI as Emission Manager for Liquidity Mining Programs\n    1. ACI will be authorized to manage Emission Programs for Liquidity Mining across Aave Markets.\n    2. ACI’s multisig address will be the one receiving and distributing emissions on behalf of the DAO.\n2. Appointment of ACI as coordinator with ecosystem partners, to define and implement emission strategies, managing the distribution of rewards to liquidity providers, and monitor & adjust emissions based on market performance.\n3. Integration of Liquidity mining program as part of “Dolce Vita” service of the ACI at no extra cost for the DAO.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe ACI multisig address will be set as the emission manager via the **`setEmissionAdmin()`** method in the relevant emission manager contracts.\n\nACI multisig address: 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd\n\nThis method will appoint the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) wallet as the emissions admin for all potential Liquidity Mining Programs.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This adjustment aims to enhance capital efficiency and ensure a more effective utilization of liquidity within the Aave protocol.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nCurrently, the optimal usage ratios vary across different Aave instances, reflecting a balance between liquidity utilization and risk management. By increasing the optimal usage ratio for WETH to 90%, higher returns for liquidity providers and improved borrowing conditions for users can be achieved.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe existing optimal usage ratios for WETH across different markets are as shown in the image below and can also be checked in the Aave dashboard [here](https://dash.onaave.com/). \n\n \n![weth optimal ratio.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiherodz64aqwm3oosc5dpymmhplzabnxwkc6sssa46lkrlgxwzhuu)\n    \n\n\nThis proposal will increase WETH Optimal Usage Ratio to 90% on the following markets which are currently at 80%, in order to unify them all:\n\nGnosis V3\n\nPolygon V3\n\nMetis V3\n\nBase V3\n\nAvalanche V3\n\nScroll V3\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

This proposal seeks to extend our collaboration, focusing on three primary axes: Skyward, Growth, and Representation.\n\n### Skyward:\n\n![image|2000x559](upload://22rgZUXRYxc6uOrlNotwo8BiZ6l.png)\n\n\nSkyward has emerged as a cornerstone of Aave's governance, producing 90 AIPs in 180 days. This averages out to **[one AIP every other day](https://dune.com/alice_rozengarden/aip-creation-in-2023)**, a testament to the relentless dedication and efficiency of the ACI. Beyond numbers, the ACI has fostered a spirit of collaboration within the Aave ecosystem.\n\nWe've co-authored proposals with the vast majority of active DAO service providers, recognized delegates and some active community members. Moreover, our doors have always been open to third-party protocols. By actively welcoming and collaborating with them, we've streamlined the governance process, ensuring that Aave remains inclusive and cohesive in its approach.\n\n**What to expect for phase II?**\n\nContinuation & extension of the Skyward services.\n\n### Growth:\n\n![image|2000x1088](upload://qjlOWocj80wUPeSHio06wG9yJBp.jpeg)\n\n\nThe ACI operates under a guiding principle of \"**Continuous incremental improvement.**\"\n\nWhile we acknowledge that we might not be the driving force behind tech breakthroughs like a potential Aave V4 or, recently, the Governance V3 AIP, our daily commitment is unwavering. We aim to make the protocol 1% better every single day, one AIP at a time. It's through these consistent, small steps that we believe Aave can maintain its leadership in the DeFi space.\n\nOur efforts have already borne fruit. The implementation of offboarding plans for assets like BUSD & TUSD stands out. These initiatives not only enhanced protocol safety but also turned a profit, generating close to 1M$ for the DAO. This revenue, in itself, has multiple times repaid the investment made in the ACI. Furthermore, our vigilant oversight of the DAO's finances has ensured efficiency. We've curbed overspending, optimized budgets, and deterred proposals that didn't align with Aave's best interests, saving the DAO a 7-figure amount & ensuring every GHO & DAO $ is well spent.\n\n**What to expect for phase II?**\n\nThe ACI will continue to focus on our continuous incremental improvement doctrine, being a driving force in Aave protocol growth and BD.\n\nFor Phase II the main focal points will be on Liquid Staking Tokens diversity with the support of onboarding new assets, GHO growth and adoption with support of synergies and the integration of GHO in both onchain protocols, ramps & L2s.\n\n### Representation:\n\nThe ACI has actively engaged in both internal and external representation for the Aave DAO.\n\n**Internal Representation**:\n\nPrior to the ACI's involvement, the DAO too often encountered challenges, such as proposals not reaching the required quorum. Governance activity was subdued, and the operations were notably insular. The ACI introduced several key initiatives:\n\n- **Orbit Program**: The ACI allocated ~20% of its budget to the Orbit program, focusing on diversity. This program compensates recognized delegates for their contributions, leading to increased participation rates and improved diversity metrics. The frequency of proposals failing due to a lack of quorum has decreased. With the now DAO-funded Orbit program, **the DAO has enshrined these benefits**\n- **Governance Guidelines**: The ACI contributed to the establishment of the Aave DAO governance guidelines. This effort aimed to bring clarity, predictability, and efficiency to DAO governance. The \"**Minimal Viable Bureaucracy**\" ACI Doctrine, ensures a balance between structured governance and accessibility.\n- **Support for New Delegates**: The ACI has extended support to emerging delegate platforms, co-authoring proposals and providing guidance. This collaborative approach has enriched the DAO's ecosystem.\n\n**What to Expect from Phase II?**\n\nWe will continue contributing to the Aave DAO frameworks and supporting DAO active participants seeking a balance between organization & accessibility.\n\nWe will also delegate engineering resources for service providers via mini-dapps such as the recent [acistreamcollector.com](http://acistreamcollector.com), which allows no code claims of DAO streams.\n\n**External Representation**:\n\n![image|1920x1423](upload://o68ggEFjWsJdbQHaC8hqxPvL6sV.jpeg)\n\n\nExternally, the ACI has been a voice for the Aave DAO in various capacities.\n\n- **Event Participation**: The ACI has participated in and sponsored several global events to share insights and collaborate with industry peers. In 2023, our engagements included:\n    - Web3DNA (Paris)\n    - EthDubai 2023\n    - Prague DeFi Summit/EthPrague\n    - Stable Summit (Paris)\n    - EthCC[6] (Paris)\n    - Dappcon Berlin 2023\n    - LëtzStake (Luxembourg)\n    - EthLisbon\n    - Devconnect Istanbul\n    \n    A detailed list of our engagements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/f676c1ce96f44c648ef2a40f7f1bb442?pvs=21).\n    \n- **Regulatory Engagement**: The ACI's founder holds the position of president of the DeFi committee of the French Lobby ADAN. This role involves dialogues with regulators, institutions, and governments in France and Europe regarding the DeFi sector. The ACI has been involved in discussions related to the \"Mica 2\" regulation, which addresses DeFi services.\n\nThe ACI, as one of the voices for the Aave DAO, has consistently worked towards enhancing the DAO's presence and reputation in the broader ecosystem.\n\n**What to Expect from Phase II?**\n\nThe ACI will continue to be one of the voices of Aave across the globe, supporting devs in hackathons, being one of the DAO voices during events and supporting our brand quality.\n\n![image|1920x2075](upload://bgA23q6QZxmvVDtb93Q9FuEzm51.jpeg)\n\n\n## Proposal Details\n\n- **Duration**: 180 days\n- **Budget**: 375k GHO\n- **Scope**: Continuation of the ACI's work across Skyward, Growth, and Representation.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is presenting this ARFC independently and is not compensated by any third party for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

While they were initially eligible and considered for the Orbit program, they opted to explore the possibility of becoming a service provider to the DAO. However, given their recent decision to re-organize internally and re-evaluate their proposed scope as a service provider, it's appropriate to reconsider their inclusion in the Orbit program.\n\n## Specification\n\n### TokenLogic Inclusion\n\n- TokenLogic will be recognized as an official delegate within the Orbit program for a period of 90 days.\n- They will receive a monthly compensation of 5k GHO, totaling 15k GHO over the three-month period.\n\n### Funding and Emissions\n\nTokenLogic's compensation will be in line with the Orbit program's guidelines, ensuring fairness and consistency with other delegates.\n\n### Responsibilities and Conditions\n\n- TokenLogic will actively participate in Aave governance, representing their delegators and contributing to the protocol's growth.\n- If TokenLogic presents and successfully passes a proposal to become a service provider to the DAO, their Orbit funding stream will be terminated to prevent double compensation.\n\n## Disclaimer\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The inclusion of TokenLogic is based on their merits and contributions to the Aave community.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC]  ACI Phase III - “Ad Astra”\nDate: 2024-04-24\nAuthor: MarcZeller - Aave-chan Initiative\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional year, with a proposed budget of 1M GHO.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. The “initiative” launched ~18 months ago is now a team of 8 people strong, including various talents & providing multiple services, contributing to the DAO's success.\nThis proposal seeks to extend our collaboration for another year.\n\n## ACI services:\n\nThe ACI service provider is now an 8-person team offering a variety of services for the Aave DAO. Here’s what we intend to maintain and improve during this proposal engagement:\n\n### Skywards\n\nSkywards has become the default option for the Aave governance as a whole, and the ACI is proud to keep delivering **first-class service to anyone upon simple request**. \n\n### Dolce Vita\n\nDolce Vita is the main “boring & invisible”  service of the ACI; “**Great service is often invisible, but bad service is immediately noticeable**” is our motto for Dolce Vita.\n\nAave DAO revenue is accrued, service provider coordination allows for increased efficiency, and third-party updates and integrations are done **without most community members realizing someone is doing the work in the background**. \n\nDolce Vita might be the lesser-known of all the ACI’s services, but we believe it’s actually one of the most important. We’re happy to maintain, improve, and extend Dolce Vita services along with our continued engagement with the DAO.\n\n### “Ad Astra”: (Growth)\n\nWe consider Growth and Business Development to be the core of ACI services. We coordinated, contributed to, and created numerous proposals to improve the Aave DAO revenue, and the results are clear. The **Aave DAO has never been as profitable as it is now**, and the **DAO net profits have largely overperformed the market conditions**.\n\nThe Aave DAO is the second most profitable DAO, and together, we fully intend **to become the most profitable DAO on earth**.\n\nThis part of our work is also made possible thanks to collaboration with key DAO actors in this vertical, **such as TokenLogic and Karpatkey**. We’re glad to work with them every day, and we all have our own domains of expertise, creating value synergies for this DAO.\n\n**Growth and BD are part of ACI’s DNA**. We intend to maintain and extend our contributions in this vertical.\n\n### Representation:\n\nThe ACI is now an impactful voice for the DAO. The ACI is known to support and defend the Aave DAO’s **best interests internally and externally**.\n\nWe consider that our “chainsaw” arc contributed to making the Aave DAO one of the most efficient and profitable DAOs in the world and to Aave maintaining its leader position in our vertical.\n\nThat being said, we fostered numerous synergistic initiatives to build bridges with the community and attract new users: Merit was a large success for GHO growth & Aave market share growth, APE integrated the DAO as an Arbitrum governance player and **contributed to a 750k $ARB LTIP grant** to support GHO and the **ACI represented the DAO across the globe participating, speaking & sponsoring numerous events**.\n\nWith this continuation proposal, we intend to remain a strong voice for the DAO and remain active both onchain & offchain in conferences. At the time of writing, we have **confirmed participation at Dappcon, EthCC, and Devcon** for the next few months.\n\n## Specifications\n\nProposal duration: 365 Days\nProposal Budget: 1M GHO\n\nNote: this proposal is intended to be a continuation of ACI’s previous streams due to governance mandatory delays to avoid a “gap” in ACI’s engagement, if this proposal is favored by aave governance votes, the AIP payload stream duration will be adjusted to reflect an engagement from May 5th, 2024.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is presenting this ARFC independently and is not compensated by any third party for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

    "summary": "This proposal seeks to extend Dolce Vita services to formalize and expand ACI's role in managing Aave's Snapshot and Discourse governance platforms. The timeline analysis shows a strong, stable early and consistent voting lead for YAE, with high community engagement and no significant opposition in votes. Forum sentiment is mixed but leans cautiously positive, with concerns around centralization balanced by recognition of operational necessity. Similar past proposals to onboard new services or instances to Aave v3 strongly passed with YAE and led to beneficial organizational improvements. Market and TVL impacts from similar proposals were negative but are not considered in the recommendation. Overall, the proposal aligns with a durable benefit to governance efficiency and continuity.",
