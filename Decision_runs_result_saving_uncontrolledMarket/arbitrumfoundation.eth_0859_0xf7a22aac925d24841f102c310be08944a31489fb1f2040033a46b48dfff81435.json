They provided a very detailed execution plan, grant justification, quantifiable milestones that are easily trackable. Co-contribution of incentives also helps ensure liquidity stickiness in addition to the further integrations of wstETH across Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem. Creating deep LST liquidity will considerably strengthen Arbitrum’s competitive position.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe proposal from Lido DAO's Liquidity Observation Labs (LOL) demonstrates a clear and comprehensive strategy to drive the adoption and usage of wstETH on Arbitrum. Their past success in growing wstETH on other Layer-2 networks, combined with a detailed plan for incentivization, integration, and measurement of success, instill confidence in their ability to achieve their objectives. The team's experience in managing previous grants and their focus on long-term sustainability and growth are evident. With a well-thought-out execution plan, including incentivizing liquidity pools, governance token pairs, and leveraged staking protocols, this proposal seems poised to significantly increase wstETH activity on Arbitrum, contributing to the broader expansion of the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem. We really like their strategy of matching the grant incentives post the LTIPP grants are over to maintain the liquidity on the protocol. Additionally, Lido is one of the most influential applications in the DeFi ecosystem. Their Wrapped Staked ETH (wstETH) has received traction on the platform without incentives. wstETH with enough liquidity could be a foundational staked asset on the chain, the additional liquidity allowing more projects to integrate the token and give users less reason to return back to the mainnet for wstETH buying/bridging. The LOL is also willing to match the grant request, further making this a good return on investment for the DAO. The KPIs and Milestones look fine to me. Overall, this proposal shows promise and deserves support.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\n\"Vote FOR Lido's proposal.\n\nWell thought out proposal and strongly ranked in the rubric. They've been a leader in the space and, with the success of folks like Blast and LRTs building on EigenLayer, it's in Arbitrum's best interests to maintain deep liquidity for LSTs. Lido has been well Arbitrum aligned, incentivizing liquidity here since its initial wstETH deployment. Also great to see co-contribution of incentives as well as partnerships with other DeFi protocols on Arbitrum will contribute towards stickier liquidity. There is the natural concern of overall market share (30%+) to weigh but feel it's a competitive proposal to let the DAO decide.\"",

Furthermore, we like that they will also be attempting to migrate their native governance token. \nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe applicant presents a plan that is both simple in execution and easy to monitor. Staked ETH also should be a priority for Arbitrum, as it is a quality, yield-bearing asset, thereby creating a capital flow from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Despite the high request size, we feel the potential gains for Arbitrum outweigh the price tag. We recommend this grant be approved.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nUnclear if they intend to support native minting as many other liquid derivatives have offered which greatly simplified the process of onboarding capital and continues to reinforce Arbitrum as a primary hub.  The fact that the only reference was a small bridged amount of osETH (via presumably the canonical bridge) makes it seem unlikely; 40% of the incentives are going to incentivize their own native token (it is an 80:20 balancer token so that is potentially still contributing more so to osETH liquidity but again it seems a less productive use of the proceeds for building protocol usage and more towards their token.  Would have been better to see these amounts go towards alternative uses.\n\nThe majority of the funds will be used to incentivize their own liquidity pool to deepen liquidity of the osETH/SWISE market and try and bring osETH from mainnet to Arbitrum. The grant size is large and I struggle to see how deep liquidity they may build with osETH will continue once the incentives end. I fail to see how incentivizing their own token liquidity will have a long lasting impact on the DAO and be a good return on investment.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR Stakewise's proposal.\n\nDetailed proposal that scored well in the rubric, namely re: stickiness to retain liquidity post-LTIPP and matching from Stakewise. Growing Arbitrum's share re: staked ETH is important and they've signalled a clear intention to align themselves with Arbitrum over the long term with the migration plans and incentives. The incentive mechanism is pretty straightforward re: liquidity mining. It's a large requested grant size relative to Arbitrum adoption/market demand and would have liked to see greater granularity + detail behind the milestones/timelines to match the stated KPIs, as well as the early start to a move into Arbitrum prior to LTIPP. Endorsing to the DAO despite this given importance of LSTs in the market.",
