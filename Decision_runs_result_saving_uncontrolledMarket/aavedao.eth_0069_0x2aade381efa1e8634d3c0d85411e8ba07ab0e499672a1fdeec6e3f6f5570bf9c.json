        "body": "## **Author: ACI**\n\n## **Date: 2024-10-04**\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Summary:**\n\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard EIGEN, the native token of Eigenlayer, in Aave V3 Ethereum Market. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Eigenlayer Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of EIGEN.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard steakLRT to Aave v3 Lido Instance\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-08-02\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to onboard steakLRT, Steakhouse’s restaking token built on Mellow and Symbiotic, to the Ethereum v3 Lido Instance. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe Steakhouse Resteaking Vault, steakLRT, is a wstETH-based liquid restaking token powered by Mellow and the Symbiotic restaking middleware. This is a logical extension of the work Steakhouse is doing as Lido DAO’s Finance Workstream, and is a work in progress proof of the crucial role that Lido stETH can play in helping restaking become more efficient, while preserving the decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nThe onboarding of steakLRT to the Aave v3 Lido instance aims to enhance the diversity and robustness of the Aave ecosystem by integrating a novel restaking token. \n\nsteakLRT, built on Mellow and Symbiotic, brings unique value propositions and additional yield opportunities through boosted points programs. By including steakLRT, we can continue to attract user deposits from restaking narratives and support the further growth of a Lido instance. Further, beacuse steakLRT accepts wstETH deposits, there are strategic programs that can be run to increase wstETH deposit yield through looping strategies and liquidity mining. These will continue to make the Aave v3 Lido Instance the best place to deposit wstETH as collateral. \n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMellow and Symbiotic deposits held as LRTs like steakLRT earn Symbiotic and Mellow points. \n\nMellow will do an additional boosted points program for deposits into the Aave v3 Lido instance. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: [0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbeef69ac7870777598a04b2bd4771c71212e6abc)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nsteakLRT announcement post: https://hackmd.io/@SteakhouseFi/steakLRT\n\nsteakLRT Mellow Vault: https://app.mellow.finance/restake/ethereum-steaklrt\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Steakhouse and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nSome ACI team members are investors in Mellow.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1.

MakerDAO marked a significant milestone with a rebranded to Sky, introducing USDS and sUSDS as the new iterations of DAI and sDAI. Given the established track record and widespread adoption of their predecessors, we propose to onboard these new assets to Aave v3.\n\nBy integrating USDS and sUSDS into Aave v3, we aim to maintain continuity for users who have relied on DAI and sDAI while embracing the evolution of these assets under the Sky brand.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nSky protocol team has discussed providing both token incentives and liquidity provision when USDS is onboarded. ACI is in discussion with members of Sky protocol team to finalize these programs.  \n\n### **Specification**\n\nBased on discussion with members of Sky protocol team, we propose the following: \n\n- sUSDS added as collateral and borrow asset to Aave v3 Main Instance\n- USDS added as supply and borrow asset to Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Integration with Paraswap to allow users to seamlessly swap between DAI and USDS variants within the Aave system.\n\nWe invite all service providers and community members to weigh in on these suggestions. \n\nFinal contract addresses will be provided upon final launch of the Sky protocol.  \n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Sky and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.
