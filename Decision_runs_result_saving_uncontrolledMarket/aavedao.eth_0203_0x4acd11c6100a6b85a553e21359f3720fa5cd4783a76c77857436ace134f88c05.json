If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is Yae, escalate to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

As weETH has already been approved for onboarding to Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base by the DAO, this proposal extends the onboarding of weETH to Aave v3 on Scroll.\n\n## **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:**\n\nweETH deposits into Aave on Scroll will accumulate [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points and Scroll Marks.\n\n## **Specification:**\n\nweETH on Scroll: [0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x01f0a31698c4d065659b9bdc21b3610292a1c506)\n\nweETH/ETH Chainlink Feed: [0x57bd9E614f542fB3d6FeF2B744f3B813f0cc1258](https://scrollscan.com/address/0x57bd9E614f542fB3d6FeF2B744f3B813f0cc1258)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers and the ARFC will be updated following their feedback.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (weETH)|2,000|\n|Borrow Cap (weETH)|400|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|72.50%|\n|LT|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.50%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|ETH-correlated|\n\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[Ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/)\n\n[weETH Base onboarding](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboarding-of-weeth-to-aave-v3-on-base/17691)\n\n[weETH Arbitrum onboarding](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=76&ipfsHash=0x78778591515790b337fcdcc2a02d49dc58e98cad614c33d61e1173bc6194729d)\n\n[weETH Onboarding](https://vote.onaave.com/proposal/?proposalId=74&ipfsHash=0x227ef8b0f49775f64100ec697bc4e67b0739bd1ff08788b1f6b48a66e1d57bf7)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

This ARFC proposal suggests that Aave supports Lido Alliance efforts by deploying a new Aave V3 ETH market for Lido. This Aave v3 instance will be designed and tuned to support stETH leverage loopers. The deployment will only include wstETH and wETH assets with E-Mode enabled.\n\nLido has committed incentive programs and ecosystem support for this instance in order to bootstrap liquidity and promote additional programs within the Lido Alliance.\n\nThis market will be bootstrapped with wETH from the Ahab program to attract wETH liquidity.\n\nwETH suppliers will also be proposed to be eligible to a dedicated Merit Boost\n\nIncentives from Lido will be detailed ahead of the AIP deployment. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe Lido Alliance’s Aave v3 instance implements the following:\n\n- The borrow cap of wETH will be set to 90% of supplied wETH, with updates tightly controlled by the risk steward. This will ensure that stETH/wETH loops are consistently profitable and can't go into negative territory.\n- E-Mode LTV & LT are set 50 bps above all other Aave implementations, making it the most efficient loop venue in the industry.\n- For the first 6 months of the Lido Alliance Aave v3, wETH slope1 will be set at 2.50%, ((currently 2.7% on mainnet and on L2s) and wETH RF set at 10% (currently 15% on all markets). This will make it the most profitable venue to loop stETH & wETH.\n- wstETH RF will be 5%.\n\nThe deployment of the Aave V3 Lido Ecosystem Aave will be done by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.\n\n|Parameter|wstETH value|wETH value|\n|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|650K|900K|\n|Borrow Cap|12k|810K|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|NA|\n|LTV|80.00%|82.00%|\n|LT|81.00%|83.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|6%|5%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|3.5%|2.50%|\n|Variable Slope2|85%|85%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|5.00%|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|\n|Flahloanable|Yes|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|No|\n|E-Mode|Yes|Yes|\n|E-Mode LTV|93.5%|93.5%|\n|E-Mode LT|95.5%|95.5%|\n|E-mode Liquidation Bonus|1%|1 %|\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nLido Alliance proposal: https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-alliance-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem/7475\n\n https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/17930\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lido and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.

Work with service providers and Lido Alliance to release and promote the new Aave v3 instance. \n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

It has also seen large demand for use as collateral on other lending protocols.\n\nIn order to capitalize on this demand, we propose deploying a dedicated Aave v3 instance for Ethena’s stablecoins and related collateral assets. \n\nTo start the instance will use sUSDe and USDe as main collateral assets, with USDC, DAI and USDT as supply assets. \n\nWe also propose providing the Ethena instance with an initial GHO facilitator. \n\nThe goals for this instance will be to grow Aave market share for borrowers using sUSDe and USDe as well as create an additional steady revenue stream of GHO. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Ethena Aave v3 instance will implement the following:\n\n- The market will include sUSDe, USDe, USDC, DAI, USDT and a new GHO facilitator. Additional assets to consider during ARFC are Ethena’s Pendle PT tokens and rsUSDe.\n- This GHO facilitator will be limited in size to start both to limit risk to Ethena collateral and protect liquidity and the GHO peg.\n- The market will have stablecoin E-Mode to allow for high leverage borrowing between the correlated assets.\n- The market will use the existing sUSDe and USDe capped oracles, so that borrowers are not affected by fluctuations in the secondary market price.\n- Borrow parameters will match the mainnet Aave v3 instance, making it the most competitive location to borrow against sUSDe and USDe.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated by Ethena for the publication of this proposal.\n\nACI team members are holders of sUSDe, USDe and ENA.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
