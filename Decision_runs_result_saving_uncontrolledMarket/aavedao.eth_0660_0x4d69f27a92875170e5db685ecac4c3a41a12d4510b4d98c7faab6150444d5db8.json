        "body": "## Rate of Change Consensus \nTo achieve sustainability, Aave must combine *value creation* under favorable market conditions with *protection* of itself and its users when conditions become unfavorable [1]. \n\n**Aave must be able to lower the liquidation threshold of collateral assets to reduce the risk it and its users face under those adverse conditions**. While loan-to-value and liquidation bonus are also useful means of reducing the risk of insolvency, they are not effective substitutes. \n\nOver the last several weeks, Gauntlet has collaborated with BGD Labs, Llama, Governance House, and other community stakeholders to align on how to most effectively serve the protocol regarding the tradeoffs between value creation and protection. \n\nLiquidation threshold reductions can impact users in a number of ways. In particular, if a user's account health is low, this type of parameter change can render the account eligible for liquidation. \n\nIf a user rebalances their position ahead of a liquidation threshold reduction, they will avoid liquidation. For this reason, Gauntlet will provide notice to the community via communication channels that may include the forums and Twitter, among others.\n\nThat said, there is always some chance that a user will not monitor their health factor or fail to supply collateral in time, resulting in \"risk-off liquidations\".\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nBGD, Llama, Governance House, and other community members have emphasized that these liquidations impinge on the borrower user experience. It is therefore important that the community explicitly aligns on a desired maximum reduction to liquidation thresholds per AIP.\n\nCommunity input is also valuable because limits on LT reduction impose an important trade-off:\n1. A lower max LT reduction will minimize the impact to borrowers but at the cost of reducing the rate at which risk can be taken off. This, in turn, limits the extent to which leverage can be increased during favorable conditions, making Aave less capital efficient and coming at the cost of borrow volume. \n2. A higher max LT reduction will strengthen Aave's ability to maximize capital efficiency under favorable market conditions but increase the potential for risk-off liquidations.\n\n\n---\n\nThe options for this Snapshot vote are the following: Per AIP, each collateral asset's liquidation threshold may be reduced by an absolute percentage of up to:\n* 3% (see point (2) above)\n* 2%\n* 1% (see point (1) above)\n* 0% (no risk management)\n* Abstain\n\nNote:\n* *This limit would **not** apply under severe conditions, such as a contract vulnerability.* \n* *It **would** apply to all collateral assets Gauntlet supports, including WETH, WBTC, DAI, &c. [2].*\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## \n[1] Please find a detailed explanation of Gauntlet's Risk Management methodology [here](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c).\n\n[2] A complete list of currently supported assets can be found [here](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave).",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust three (3) total risk parameters including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across two (2) Aave V2 assets. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to, asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made, but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n## Specification\n\n\nThe past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility. However, there were also decreases in liquidity and trading volume. Our simulations show that increasing borrow parameters across a wide array of assets could introduce significantly more risk in the short term. The below recommendations drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining risk at safe levels.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |\n| FEI Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 02/10 to 02/24. These are useful metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 02-24 Volatility| 02-10 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| DPI    | 0.767483446      | 0.952875317     | -0.185391871      | 4.8907976   |\n| FEI    | 0.05450812       | 0.072266895     | -0.017758775      | -41.5184138 |\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0UZoeQX.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-03-01\n",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold, Loan To Value, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V2 assets. \n\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Shar1i3.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DcrG6hE.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/60LomXa.png)\n\n\n\n**Top STETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o2zzUVf.png)\n\n**Top WBTC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JL3W7IP.png)\n\n\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| STETH Liquidation Threshold     | 81%     | 83%     |\n| STETH Loan To Value     | 69%     | 72%     |\n| STETH Liquidation Bonus     | 7.5%     | 7%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Threshold    | 80%     | 82%     |\n| WBTC Loan To Value     | 70%     | 72%     |\n\nWe have ingested the most recent Aave and market data, including user positions, prices, volatility, and liquidity for all assets, including stETH, WETH, and WBTC. We then ran simulations to stress test the protocol in times of high volatility.\n\nAs shown in the dashboard screenshot below, our simulations show that Aave can increase capital efficiency while decreasing the risk of bad debt using these parameterization recommendations.\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CGcOHWG.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-10-11\n\n## Quick Links\n[Analytics Dashboard](https://metabase.gauntlet.network/public/dashboard/f4930651-29be-4ff3-b664-a34462e286c5)\n[Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave)\n[Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc)\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) \n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n\n\n",

For more information, please refer to our [Aave market risk assessment](https://gauntlet.network/reports/aave) where we provide a tactical understanding of our model architecture. \n\n## Specification\n\nThese past two weeks saw slight decreases in volatility and increases in liquidity and trading volume, which our simulations picked up on. In addition, our recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-downturn-gauntlet-risk-review-jan-2022/7190) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. We will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |\n| CRV Liquidation Threshold    | 60%     | 65%     |\n| FEI Loan To Value    | 50%     | 60%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 60%     | 70%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus     | 7.5%     | 6.5%     |\n| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| SNX Loan To Value    | 40%     | 45%     |\n| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 60%     | 65%     |\n| xSUSHI Loan To Value    | 45%     | 50%     |\n| xSUSHI Liquidation Threshold    | 60%     | 65%     |\n| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 01/18 to 02/09.

        "title": "Should twelve (12) total risk parameters across eight (8) Aave V2 assets be updated?",
        "author": "0xDD659911EcBD4458db07Ee7cDdeC79bf8F859AbC",
        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust twelve (12) total risk parameters across eight (8) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. \n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nIn addition, we propose to enable utilizing FEI as a collateral on Aave. The initial parameters for FEI will be an LTV of 50%, a Liquidation Threshold of 60%, and a Liquidation Bonus of 6.5%. Most of the stablecoins that can be used as collateral are more liquid, and our platform's analysis recommends initially capping the amount of collateral that can be liquidatable to the average daily trading volume. If user behavior and market conditions over the coming months continue to show safe conditions for increasing capital efficiency on FEI, we shall recommend ramping up the LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus incrementally.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis past week did not see outsized changes in market conditions nor within the Aave protocol. There were slight volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets. Our platform recommends the following set of parameter changes that will decrease liquidation bonuses on several less-utilized assets.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| BAL Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| CRV Loan To Value   | 45%     | 55%     |\n| DPI Loan To Value     | 65%     | 70%     |\n| DPI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.5%     | 7.5%     |\n| DPI Liquidation Threshold    | 70%     | 75%     |\n| ENJ Loan To Value    | 60%     | 70%     |\n| FEI Loan To Value    | 0%     | 50%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Threshold    | 0%     | 60%     |\n| FEI Liquidation Bonus    | 0%     | 6.5%     |\n| MANA Loan To Value    | 65%     | 70%     |\n| MKR Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| UNI Liquidation Bonus     | 8.0%     | 7.5%     |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q8uyBaE.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-01-18",
