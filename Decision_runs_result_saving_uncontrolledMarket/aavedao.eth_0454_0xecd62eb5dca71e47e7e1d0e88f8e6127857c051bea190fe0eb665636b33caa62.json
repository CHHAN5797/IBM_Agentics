The distribution aims to reimburse the gas costs incurred by delegates during their participation in Aave governance.\n\n## Motivation:\nRecognized delegates play a crucial role in Aave governance by actively participating in proposal discussions, voting, and other governance activities. These activities often involve gas costs, especially when interacting with the Ethereum network. The Aave community established a quarterly gas rebate distribution to incentivize and support their continued participation.\n\n## Specification:\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the total gas used by each recognized delegate and the corresponding ETH amount to be distributed:\n\n| Name             | Total Gas Spent          |\n|------------------|--------------------------|\n| ACI              | 1.35      |\n| HKTrust          | 0.07     |\n| TokenLogic       | 0.50     |\n| michigan         | 0.11     |\n| LBS Blockchain   | 0.18     |\n| Wintermute       | 0.15     |\n| keyrock          | 0.14     |\n| Stablelab        | 0.20     |\n| **Total ETH** | **2.7 ETH** | \n\n\n\n### Notes:\n1. @Alice forked and edited the flipside script to improve it & increase accuracy to track voting participation. here's the new script : https://dune.com/queries/2970451\n2. The voting requirement was lowered to 70% from 80% to include Michigan & HKUST. Ideally, all recognized delegates would maintain an 80% participation rate. However, considering the summer break and the involvement of student delegates, a more lenient approach was adopted this quarter.\n3. The script was updated to track better gas spent by Gnosis Safes, benefiting both TokenLogic & HKUST. This improvement was a joint effort by @JosepBove & @MarcZeller.\n[the output of the script can be seen here](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gas-rebate-August-2023-Script-output-d611e6123ffb4397b61d94c73e64c8c7?pvs=4)\njust like last quarter, amounts have been rounded strictly up to the second decimal place for more straightforward AIP implementation.\n4. Some delegates, including ACI & Tokenlogic, are transitioning from old addresses to new ones. This transition was considered when determining eligibility for the rebate.\n5. Proposal creation & execution expenses were covered. Service providers interested in having their costs covered can discuss this in this thread. Payload deployments are not covered this quarter due to technical reasons.\n6. Instead of wETH, it is proposed to distribute ETH directly this quarter for ease of use for all delegates.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.

If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding\n\n## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs\n\n## Date: 2023-09-15\n---\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.\n\nThis integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.\n\nAlongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.\n\nIt's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.\n\nwGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:\n\n- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.\n- wGHO parameters:\n\n| LTV | 77% |\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 80%  |\n| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |\n| Supply Cap | 1M |\n| Borrow Cap | 0 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |\n\n### Note:\n\nwGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.\n\nOnboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback and consensus on this ARFC.\n2. Escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot Stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Increase GHO Borrow Rate\n## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n## Date: 2023-08-23\n---\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes an increase in the borrow rate of GHO from the current rate of 1.5% to 2.5%. The aim is to address the peg deviation of GHO and ensure its growth and trustworthiness in the market.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nGHO has witnessed a rapid growth, reaching a circulating supply of 22M in just a few weeks since its launch. One of the primary reasons for this growth, especially in the current adverse market conditions, is the GHO borrow rate set below the market price of stablecoin borrows. This low rate, combined with the current lack of holding venues and the inability to use GHO as collateral, has made single-side liquidity provision in stableswaps, such as Balancer pools, [one of the most sought-after strategies.](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity)\n\nWhile deep liquidity and growth are desired as a go-to-market strategy for GHO, the peg deviation of GHO (currently around $0.975) is affecting its growth and trust in the market. A consensus short-term solution to this issue is to slightly raise the GHO borrow rate from 1.5% to 2.5%. This rate remains attractive for borrowers and is still below the market average rates. However, by reducing the discount, it is anticipated to have a positive effect.\n\nThis proposal is particularly relevant in the context of the potential [sDAI onboarding integration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sdai-aave-v3-onboarding/14410). This integration is expected to add short-term sell pressure on GHO, especially with the current borrow rate, which could further harm the GHO peg.\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Asset**: GHO\n- **Contract Address**: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f\n- **Current Borrow Rate**: 1.5%\n- **Proposed Borrow Rate**: 2.5%\n- **New discounted Borrow Rate**: ~1.75%\n\n## Disclamer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, implement the proposed changes to the GHO borrow rate.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This ARFC proposes a rebate system for these gas fees, aiming to incentivize active engagement and cultivate a more diverse voter base.\n\nRebating delegates for their participation offers several benefits:\n\n- Encourages more active engagement from the delegate community by eliminating the disincentive to vote, leading to better decision-making for Aave.\n- Fosters a more diverse voter base, including student organizations, by reducing the barrier to entry for voting. This creates a more open and collaborative delegate ecosystem, driving participation.\n- Helps retain top delegates to foster the growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being an excellent Aave delegate should not result in a net cost to the delegate due to ever-increasing gas costs.\n- Can be achieved at a relatively low cost. We also propose measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Claiming Process\n\nEvery quarter, an ARFC will be proposed (with the current one being the first) to publish an AIP reimbursing gas fees spent by recognized delegates.\n\nThese gas fees are determined by an open-source script written by @JosepBove, which allows anyone to generate a JSON file of recognized delegates' gas spending.\n\nThis script can be run and verified by any community member to approve the amounts distributed to recognized delegates.\n\nOnce a consensus has been reached on an ARFC, an appointed Governance Facilitator will submit an AIP to transfer aWETH to the delegate's address. We initially propose that the Aave Chan Initiative serves as the Governance Facilitator.\n\n### Gas Rebate Token\n\nWe propose that the Gas Rebate Token be wETH.\n\n## Proposed reimboursement\n\nhere's the output of the script for the previous quarter, covering AIP-165 until AIP-236 and Ethereum blocks from `16726166` until `17343620`:\n\n| Name          | Address                                      | Gas Used                  |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| ACI           | 0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4 | 0.95                      |\n| ACI AIP deployer              | 0x3Cbded22F878aFC8d39dCD744d3Fe62086B76193 | 0.33                      |\n| Flipside      | 0x62a43123FE71f9764f26554b3F5017627996816a | 0.38                      |\n| TokenLogic    | 0xA06c2e5BB33cd6718b08EC9335081Cbba62861f7 | 0.21                      |\n| michigan      | 0x13BDaE8c5F0fC40231F0E6A4ad70196F59138548 | 0.21                      |\n| LBS Blockchain| 0xB83b3e9C8E3393889Afb272D354A7a3Bd1Fbcf5C | 0.26                      |\n| Wintermute    | 0xB933AEe47C438f22DE0747D57fc239FE37878Dd1 | 0.19                      |\n| keyrock       | 0x1855f41B8A86e701E33199DE7C25d3e3830698ba | 0.16                      |\n| Stablelab     | 0xea172676E4105e92Cc52DBf45fD93b274eC96676 | 0.29                      |\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to @JosepBove, a new contributor to the ACI, for developing the GasRebate Script.

The proposed risk parameters for LUSD will mirror those currently in place for USDC on the same pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by users of the Liquity Protocol. It has demonstrated its resilience and maintained a stable peg, even in volatile market conditions. By adding LUSD as a collateral asset on the Aave V3 ETH pool, we can offer our users more options for their DeFi activities. Furthermore, the integration of LUSD could potentially synergize with the GHO, enhancing liquidity and further reinforcing the stability of the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed risk parameters for LUSD on the Aave V3 ETH pool are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 77% |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 80% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 4.5% |\n\nThese parameters are identical to those currently in place for USDC on the Aave V3 ETH pool.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173/13) program, the ACI has not been compensated by any third-party to present this ARFC.\nAt the time of writing, the author does not hold LQTY tokens but owns some LUSD.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP for final approval and implementation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
