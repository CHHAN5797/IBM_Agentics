        "body": "**Timeline of Updates:**\n\n*Oct 24 - MVP posted*\n*Oct 30 - Mission statement updated*\n*Nov 1 - Proposal put on hold while seeking final feedback.*\n*Dec 9 - Purpose statement updated.*\n*Dec 12 - Will proceed to Snapshot.*\n\n## Non-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing extensive conversations with stakeholders and active delegates, and feedback on our initial mission/vision/goals [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-dao-s-vision-mission-and-goals/26537), Entropy Advisors has decided to modify our approach for aligning the Arbitrum DAO on its end state goals and the more granular strategy through which these will be reached. This approach can be distilled into three separate phases:\n\n1. Achieving wide-reaching agreement on why the Arbitrum DAO exists and what it is trying to accomplish. In other words, what is the Arbitrum DAO’s mission, vision, and purpose. The MVP is purposefully simple and unambiguous such that it is absolutely clear what the DAO is ultimately working towards, with additional complexity only introduced when strategic goals to reach the end state are created. Without an agreed upon north star, it is impossible to evaluate how one-off strategies and initiatives assist the DAO to reach its goals, simply because there is currently a wide set of different opinions on what the DAO is striving to achieve. Additionally, most—if not all—initiatives and strategies are evaluated in isolation without considering how they play into wider frameworks. While the MVP might feel too abstract, its purpose is to enable more complexity to be stacked on top of it through iterative efforts.\n\n2. Once the DAO’s end state goals have been solidified, anyone will have the opportunity to propose a strategy matrix made up of 12- and 24-month focus areas for the DAO through an open process named Strategic Objective Setting (SOS). These areas should have well-established guidelines for tangible implementation and what they aim to accomplish, as well as only have one purpose—optimally moving the DAO towards its end state. This is the step that will allow the DAO to refocus its attention on the most critical deliverables and judge how one-off initiatives fit into its short- to medium-term priorities. Entropy Advisors is working on the SOS proposal in tandem with the MVP, and it will be posted as a subsequent separate proposal with the DAO choosing one matrix of strategies as the winner.\n\n3. Combined with financial forecasting, the SOS will enable the DAO to budget itself for the next 12/24 months by earmarking capital to each strategic focus area ratified in step 2. Arguably, the most important aspect of this step is for the DAO to align on how profitable/loss-making it wants to be during the coming year(s). Lastly, with clearly defined strategic focus areas, it should also become simpler for the DAO to begin marketing its efforts since, e.g., a clear identity, as well as narratives, can be built around each of the DAO’s focus areas.\n\n![MVP image 1.png](ipfs://bafkreihzcndqv6am5ba2uqx3nnecirushrkktinzlbrqkn46spaxu3767i)\n\nWhen it comes to this proposal, we’ve strived to distill numerous key stakeholders’ and delegates’ thoughts and ideas into a cohesive mission, vision, and purpose for the Arbitrum DAO, presented below. It’ll naturally be impossible to align all DAO participants on the DAO’s end state goals because of the ecosystem’s diversity. However, for this exercise to be successful, the passed Mission, Vision, and Purpose must have buy-in from a clear majority of the DAO and cannot be unilaterally pushed forward.\n\nAfter looking into other ecosystems, we concluded that [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355) currently has the best-suited mechanism to strategically define objectives in a decentralized and efficient manner, which is why we are striving to implement a program for Arbitrum that takes influence from Lido. We thank Lido DAO contributors who set a great example of how decentralized governance should go about this exercise.\n\n## Call to Action\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO’s Guiding Principles are as Follows:\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\n![MVP Image 2.png](ipfs://bafybeieolo4gzttjfxjoa3rv5werhlpfdo36cagyniy7jqzhbcbmcizkci)\n\n\n## Motivation + Rationale\n\nThe current lack of defined mission, vision, purpose, and strategic objectives today has created a notable, twofold inefficiency in the DAO:\n\n1. Each organization operating in the DAO must extrapolate for itself what it should work towards that contributes the most value to Arbitrum. Questions arise such as:\n* Should my organization work toward enabling operational sustainability and painting a picture of ARB as a productive asset?\n* Growth of the technology stack:\n    i. Orbit?\n    ii. Stylus?\n    iii. Arbitrum One?\n* What role should public goods have within Arbitrum?\n\nWith a lack of clear strategic focus areas, being an effective DAO operator becomes difficult. Redundant and conflicting work turn into a reality due to a lack of alignment and organizational structure.\n\n2. The absence of concrete goals has made it challenging for the DAO to judge the effectiveness of initiatives. A system has been created where all the DAO can effectively do is judge “Did this organization work hard” but lacks the ability to judge “Did this organization do a good job moving Arbitrum forward towards its end state goals.”\n\nAdditionally, a clear vision is required for the DAO to pursue its own brand and marketing strategies. It is time to align on this vision. If Arbitrum DAO executes its mission successfully, what does Arbitrum’s place in the world look like? What are the ecosystem and its numerous contributors (the DAO and its programs, the Foundation, and development teams) working towards? What sets Arbitrum apart from competitors?\n\nThe goal of the MVP proposal is to align the DAO on the highest level of purpose, enabling the subsequent SOS to build on top of it and function as a framework through which delegates and key stakeholders can propose and choose a set of concrete short- and mid-term goals for Arbitrum DAO. This approach helps ease Entropy's concerns with our [initial approach](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-dao-s-vision-mission-and-goals/26537), where the proposal promised everything under the sun as it continually expanded with more (and sometimes conflicting) opinions into the mix. Additionally, we believe our original desire to set out on a 5-year plan left too much room for ambiguity without tangible steps to be taken.\n\nThus, the scope has been reduced. Even within the objectively high-level MVP proposal herein, there are still likely to be areas of contention, such as whether Arbitrum should align with Ethereum more closely, whether the DAO should put a greater emphasis on its flagship Arbitrum One product, and whether the delegates will actually feel empowered to use the MVP as a driving force for their actions.\n\nThe MVP will be the foundation for most actions taken by the Arbitrum DAO going forward, especially when it comes to short- to medium-term strategy setting and budgeting. It is a document that will help drive the DAO, protocol, token, and ecosystem into the foreseeable future and directly inform decisions surrounding new proposals and initiatives.\n\n## Diving In\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem. \n\nDriving Question: Why does Arbitrum DAO exist?\n\n* Why is Arbitrum DAO developing all of the products and initiatives with the design decisions it is?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO’s purpose is to **Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem.**\n\nArbitrum is not just scaling tech, it scales L1s without concessions to censorship resistance, accessibility, decentralization, or security. A crucial component of the DAO’s existence is to defend these ideals. For its governed chains, Arbitrum DAO ensures that there is no single point of control, can eliminate rent-seeking intermediaries, and most importantly, users maintain control of their assets without trusting an entity. In order to defend Arbitrum into perpetuity, the DAO requires sustainable operations and funding mechanisms, which will be further expanded on in the Vision section below. \n\nAccording to the [blockchain trilemma](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/vision/), to scale and accommodate more throughput and users, L1s require trade-offs in terms of either security or decentralization. Making concessions to decentralization or security is not an option for Ethereum mainnet, leading to a chain that even with today’s limited number of onchain participants becomes prohibitively expensive for most users. Arbitrum DAO’s purpose, true to Vitalik’s [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), is to scale L1s while defending security and decentralization. \n\nThe second portion of Arbitrum DAO’s purpose is to guide the ecosystem. Guiding the Arbitrum ecosystem refers to every aspect of what Arbitrum offers, whether it be Arbitrum One, Orbit’s ecosystem of chains, or DAO-funded programs. At a high level, guiding encompasses two areas: growing and stewarding. Growing Arbitrum One is achieved by creating the best environment for builders, supporting their apps, bringing in more users and awareness to the value One provides, and ensuring alignment between builders and Arbitrum DAO. The same applies to Arbitrum’s Orbit chains. Sustainable growth is at the core of Arbitrum DAO’s purpose, and the DAO should view its role with respect to growth from a lens of continuing for 100s if not 1000s of years.\n\nStewarding the ecosystem relies on guiding the path forward for Arbitrum upgrades, new products, and funding decisions. In the world of Arbitrum, the DAO is in control, and that means making informed decisions that optimally move the ecosystem forward in an unceasing and durable way. The DAO is in charge of calling the shots for the future of Arbitrum. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\nDriving Question: What is Arbitrum DAO doing to achieve its purpose?\n\n* What activities is it executing in practice that lead to its reason for existence being achieved?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO’s mission is to **Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.**\n\nArbitrum DAO’s mission is to empower people with the sovereignty to build what they want, code in their preferred language, execute without barriers, and create without needing permission—embracing true onchain freedom. However, building one's best onchain world does not just apply to developers, but equally to users, creators, and DAO contributors.\n\nArbitrum gives builders the freedom to develop on their own terms. “Your chain, Your rules.” This includes, among other things, allowing for self-governed rollups (not forcing ARB into the design) and supporting multiple languages. Arbitrum stands out in being the best and most robust scaling tech, but also in forward-thinking design decisions that enable it to be the primary home for builders by giving freedom and flexibility to its development community.\n\nThe most important aspect of enabling the best onchain world is achieved through Arbitrum continuing to build a full-featured tech stack that includes battle-tested permissionless proving, forced inclusion, custom gas tokens, multi-language support, interoperability, MEV solutions, and much more. True to its purpose, the best onchain world with Arbitrum has security at its core.\n\nEmpowering rollup and application developers to leverage the best-in-class technology stack without restrictions will establish network effects and, importantly, a unified narrative that ties together the rest of the ecosystem, creating an environment that attracts new builders across a wide set of verticals to Arbitrum. This in turn enables Arbitrum to be the primary destination for compelling blockspace, defined as a blockchain’s ability to attract users through the utility it provides. For a rollup to be compelling, it must have sought-after blockspace, which can only be achieved in one way: Attracting great apps. We don't just aim to create blockspace that maintains Ethereum's core values, we aim to create blockspace that people want to use. Attracting builders is one of the most crucial pieces to Arbitrum’s mission. While crypto has many amazing apps, compelling blockspace is the key that will enable crypto to break into magnitudes more users in the future. Today, Arbitrum One is the most compelling rollup in crypto and the DAO’s flagship product, and that is an achievement we must continue to support at all costs. That said we must not lose sight that on a long time horizon, the ecosystem will also expand through complimentary Orbit chains.\n\nWhen it comes to end-users, creators, and DAO contributors, Arbitrum DAO’s mission to empower people with freedom can be quantified in two notable ways:\n1. Being part of a wider, resonating collective movement generates a certain degree of loyalty, excitement, and alignment that is difficult to quantify, yet crucial in driving long-term, sustained engagement and new contributions.\n2. Freedom is attributed to the ability to pick and choose from a wide selection of applications and infrastructure-level solutions, creating a package of services tailored to specific requirements. Arbitrum offers flexibility to meet diverse priorities and utility functions—whether users value security, privacy, low costs, etc., the ecosystem adapts to support them all. Arbitrum is building to be the one-stop shop where end users, creators, and DAO contributors are equipped to effortlessly perform anything that’s achievable on a blockchain without constraints.\n\nIn order to reach the aforementioned goals, it is of the utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO runs sustainable operations with revenue. Without sustainability, it will be impossible for the DAO to continue supporting the building out of the best scaling tech, pushing forward an ecosystem attracting the best builders, and providing end users, creators, and DAO contributors with an empowering, collaborative, and personalized environment. A pivotal part of Arbitrum DAO’s mission is ensuring that all highly adopted Arbitrum-based rollups and apps create revenue for the DAO, maintaining alignment between the ecosystem and token.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\nDriving Question: What is the end state goal for Arbitrum that the DAO is striving to achieve?\n\n* Where is Arbitrum’s place in the world after the DAO achieves all it has set out to do?\n\nAnswer: **Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.**\n\nWith the most full-featured tech stack and compelling (sought-after) blockspace in crypto on Arbitrum stack rollups, users and builders from all walks of life and verticals will have flocked into the Arbitrum ecosystem. New users’ first onboarding experience in crypto will be through an Arbitrum rollup, while the default choice for developers will be to deploy on an Arbitrum technology stack-enabled chain. In a world where financial transactions happen onchain, the majority will take place on Arbitrum blockspace.\n\nArbitrum DAO will function as a resilient flywheel. The best tech stack together with robust ecosystem support will increasingly attract builders and notable enterprises who create and enable applications that onboard more users into the ecosystem. Profits accruing to the DAO from users leveraging Arbitrum’s blockspace will bolster network security and also be reinvested in a sustainable and diversified manner. Sequencing and licensing fees will be reinforced by acquiring ownership interests that help expand the ecosystem (intangible) and enable value accrual (tangible). The DAO will function with some similarities to a conglomerate, leveraging investments to create an even more robust application and infrastructure layer, directly strengthening its core product, which again will produce increasing returns that can be used to strengthen network security through ARB and to support new growth.\n\n![MVP Image 3.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeie47gxhymgnzlpwh5p7v24s6fhwlbc3ai3dff7jcbykkadfn2jema)\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nIt took multiple months of conversations with stakeholders to really get a sense of Arbitrum DAO’s future but Entropy Advisors is very happy with the potential for this new process. While much of this proposal is not directly actionable, we believe that it is the necessary first step in moving forward with Arbitrum DAO’s future strategic plans. We look forward to making final modifications to the MVP based on the DAO’s feedback. It is worth noting that it is not possible for the MVP to serve everyone's desires because it would end up with contradictions, but it’s important that it is a document that the DAO can get behind and feel empowered to use.\n\nThe subsequent SOS (Strategic Objective Setting) proposal will be the next step in this exercise, in which anyone will be able to create 12- and 24-month actionable strategic goals for the DAO. The SOS will be posted shortly after the MVP. If approved, it will include a 14-day notice period and 30-day submission window, in which any contributor can submit a strategy matrix of concrete strategic objectives aligned with the MVP. These workstreams could then be budgeted, creating a new paradigm for operational structure in the DAO.\n\n## Expected Timeline\n\n1. Dec 9th: final version of MVP forum period requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions. Will be extended if necessary.\n3. Dec 12th: Snapshot to signal approval/disapproval/abstention of MVP (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n4. Late Dec / Early Jan: SOS posted\n5. Entropy Advisors plans to take the MVP to a constitutional vote, adding it as language to the constitution, after a 6-month trial period. During the initial 6 months, changes can be made to the MVP via a proposal+Snapshot vote, but after being included in the constitution, would require a constitutional onchain amendment. It is our belief that the current MVP is broad enough to handle substantial changes in the crypto market.\n\nA huge thank you to @castlecapital, @maxlomu, and all the other contributors who dedicated considerable time and effort to provide us with valuable feedback on this exercise.",

        "body": "# Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the ideas and concepts introduced by [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) in the initial [Operation Company (OpCo) proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737). The OpCo is a legal entity that delegates and key stakeholders can leverage to achieve DAO-defined goals, principally by forming an operational mesh layer and assigning internal employees or negotiating and entering into agreements with service providers and individual contributors to facilitate initiatives. OpCo’s mission is to negate identified frictions affecting the DAO’s strategy execution, such as allowing for the establishment of more operational roles for the DAO, facilitating efficient and competitive contributor and service provider negotiations and information flow between these parties, creating clear responsibilities for carrying out initiatives, and helping ensure the continuation of programs the DAO depends upon. OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes a potential advancement that could be made within its mandated focus areas, it can work on and propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Arbitrum DAO is generally unable to move swiftly when it requires specialized contributors to execute a strategy, for which there isn’t a straightforward and low-friction approach, with these processes typically requiring a vast amount of effort from the supply side instead of being driven by the demand side. Moreover, many initiatives, especially more complex and wider-reaching ones, lack clear owners in charge of ensuring a holistic approach to execution and initiatives’ continuation, meaning that in the unfortunate case that a service provider decides/is forced to disengage from its duties, there aren’t always accountable individuals or entities that would push the initiatives forward. OpCo’s goal is to function as the entity the DAO can leverage to remedy these limitations and move forward in areas that require a more structured approach.\n\nTo cover OpCo’s operating expenses over the first 30 months, including full-time staff appointed internally, setup and other admin costs, as well as the DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee, this proposal suggests earmarking 22M ARB (subject to change in either direction if market conditions change notably between the Snapshot and Tally votes) for the initiative:\n\n* 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n* Of the remaining 18M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB’s current price of $1, this would require roughly 12M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following the proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact.\n* After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 22M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\n![ARB Liquidation.png](ipfs://bafybeifs75ocgefcebce7mgv5spdjfubengcta7ua6nz5rbrlbprbbtxvq)\n\nOpCo will be able to utilize the $12M in cash equivalents as follows:\n\n* $2.5M worth of stable assets released upfront.\n* Once OpCo has officially operationalized, the entity can draw up to $500K of cash equivalents each month.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPresently, most DAO programs operate in silos, leading to, among other things, redundant efforts and non-existing cross-initiative resources. The DAO also generally depends on a single initiative leader for the continuation of a successful program, while some initiatives don’t even have clear owners, which adds significant friction to strategy execution. DAOs are also inherently disadvantaged when evaluating and swiftly engaging individual contributors or service providers, and Arbitrum is no exception. This proposal aims to provide the DAO with the capabilities to nullify the abovementioned frictions by creating a DAO-adjacent legal entity—OpCo. Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage OpCo to manage:\n\n* Operational support & project planning,\n* Project management of DAO initiatives,\n* Negotiations with service providers,\n* Allocation of resources across contributors & DAO-approved projects\n\nOpCo will grant the Arbitrum DAO better capabilities to bootstrap initiatives and secure the continuation and execution of them, while also expanding the total addressable contributor and service provider base as certain sensitive negotiations and deal terms don’t necessarily have to be disclosed publicly. Moreover, the DAO-adjacent entity will function as the operational mesh layer for individual contributors and service providers, streamlining communications and knowledge sharing across engaged entities and individuals.\n\nOverall, the DAO’s past, current, and likely upcoming initiatives can be divided into 5 high-level categories: Governance Frameworks, Financial Management, Investments, Ecosystem Support, and Grants. The initiatives, their respective owners, and into which of the 5 categories they fall are visualized below.\n\n![Current Initiatives.png](ipfs://bafybeidaponefn7ospa42xhhtdhcw2v33to5yvrskyrvcxbmtagwwl24ru)\n\nIt is of utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO maintains a decentralized and bottoms-up system for bootstrapping new projects, DAO contributors, and setting strategies, including creating and steering the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose, as well as approaches to achieve the goals and decision-making. As such, OpCo will be focused on the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management initiative categories, but note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category if the DAO so chooses through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n\nThe entity’s main focus is to increase the efficiency of strategy execution through operational optimization and, in particular, activating and recruiting the optimal stakeholders, contributors, and service providers. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO would always have ultimate authority over OpCo, with the entity purely being a helpful resource focused on streamlining wider-reaching and complex initiatives that require a more structured execution framework as well as helping push the DAO forward within areas where the entity identifies shortcomings. We want to stress the importance of ensuring that one of Arbitrum DAO’s key differentiators—enabling new participants to join the ecosystem and make an impact, growing into well-established contributors—is conserved. Without Arbitrum DAO empowering its contributors and delegates, the DAO might sacrifice one of its core strengths, and we believe that entities such as SEEDGov, Entropy Advisors, Tally, etc., are present within the ecosystem exactly because of this empowerment.\n\nArbitrum has one of the most active and engaged DAOs within the industry, combined with help from the Arbitrum Foundation and robust programs for bootstrapping and fostering growth within the ecosystem. Although there is always room for improvement, these factors have enabled the DAO to allocate grants with positive results, sustaining a vibrant and welcoming ecosystem. Having said that, if the DAO wishes to, it can expand OpCo’s mandate to include grants in the future through a Snapshot vote. When it comes to investments from treasury funds, the GCP has been established to facilitate capital allocation into the gaming sector, while the AVI is currently working on setting up a structure allowing the DAO to make venture bets across other verticals, which is why OpCo will be excluded from operating within the investments category. As alluded to earlier, we also feel as though it’s crucial that the facilitation and implementation of governance frameworks continue being driven by decentralized actors, but the DAO could again expand OpCo’s operations into this initiative category if it so wishes.\n\nWith that said, certain clear inefficiencies have been identified with respect to the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories. This is likely due to the operational frameworks enabling execution for these categories still being somewhat underexplored areas. As such, there is a lack of ownership, and the DAO has no structured way to frictionlessly operationalize contributors to push complex challenges forward within these verticals, often requiring a vast amount of Arbitrum DAO-specific knowledge and even lobbying efforts from the supply side instead of the demand side. Due to the current structure, active governance participants are generally purely incentivized to prioritize strategies that they are fit to solve. This has left certain critical domains unattended and reflects the need for an entity that could be mandated to help define the root causes of execution obstacles and provide solutions to remedy them.\n\nThe aforementioned inefficiencies are naturally amplified by the fact that the number of potential contributors is often restricted due to many initiatives requiring deep specialization. Finding the facilitators capable of managing initiatives end-to-end within these categories can be difficult. Oftentimes, the contributor and owner roles for initiatives are separated or there is not a clear owner at all, meaning that no one party is responsible for the continuation of these initiatives. For initiatives where the contributor and owner roles are the same or there is a clearly defined owner, the DAO generally relies on a single party for the continuation of the initiative. If the service provider or contributor, for any reason, decides or is forced to exit the ecosystem, there is not a well-defined framework for the initiative to be moved to a new owner.\n\nAs initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates. However, OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developments could be made, it can propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nTypically, the current protocol for the execution of strategies and new initiatives within the DAO’s two aforementioned focus areas is as follows: (i) either the proposer defines the strategic approach and goals for the initiative or a working group is created that aims to outline these specifics such that a proposal can be created, with the working group also sometimes facilitating some or all of the work required for the execution of the strategy; (ii) if not done by the working group, the proposer or proposer-connected party is contracted to facilitate the strategy or the DAO runs some type of a procurement/election process to decide the service providers or contributors; (iii) once the work has been performed and the facilitators’ term ends, a continuation proposal is created if the initiative has a clear owner. Otherwise, individual DAO contributors are required to take charge of the initiative and push it forward.\n\nIf OpCo were to be created, it would primarily be leveraged to assume responsibility for phases (ii) and (iii). I.e., the DAO defines strategies or simply strategic goals. If a clear executor to reach the key objectives exists within the DAO, they could be chosen as a facilitator and would be contracted by the OpCo. If not, OpCo could be mandated to execute these strategies by either assigning existing internal employees, hiring new internal resources, or contracting outside service providers/individual contributors to perform the required undertakings. However, if the DAO isn’t proactively defining strategies/strategic goals, OpCo is required to be active within this area as well, given it has the bandwidth to do so, with these OpCo-created strategies then ratified by the DAO through the regular voting process.\n\nOpCo would have full discretion over hiring internal employees, while anyone interested in facilitating a DAO initiative could propose themselves (or another party) for that. Such a proposal must include a capital allocation to cover the facilitator’s expenses since OpCo’s budget only covers internal employees’ salaries. If approved through governance, the facilitator would then be contracted by OpCo as a service provider for the DAO. Depending on what is viewed as the most efficient approach, OpCo will have the ability to negotiate and run procurement processes both privately and publicly, which will further strengthen the Arbitrum DAO’s ability to attract and retain top talent, with all information that can be shared with the wider DAO being made available through oversight and financial reports. The below slide depicts OpCo’s initial focus categories, but please note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category.\n\n![Future Structure.png](ipfs://bafybeiewjs6bgbqbbnrswbtdxkd2f2wr6b2ymjatwwu26ojtufsxfy3u5m)\n\nIf a DAO-ratified strategy or strategic goal that the OpCo is mandated to facilitate doesn’t have a specific end date, the DAO-adjacent entity would continue executing until the entity feels as though the associated goals have been reached or the DAO instructs the entity to stop executing by passing a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). If the work is expected to be long-term in nature, OpCo would be responsible for ensuring that it can be continued by accounting for associated costs in its budget extension request.\n\nFor example, delegates could define a high-level events strategy by deciding the number of events the Arbitrum DAO should be represented at in 2025, whether the strategy facilitator is the proposer, a proposer-related party, an OpCo internal employee, or someone who is chosen through a procurement process, and approving the strategy’s costs that are not covered by OpCo’s budget (i.e., salaries if the facilitators are not full-time staff appointed internally, booking event venues, catering, etc.) through the typical governance process, after which OpCo plans the exact events to participate in, contracts the required service providers or operationalizes internal employees, and manages all involved stakeholders and other related aspects throughout the process.\n\nService providers and individual contributors that are currently contracted, or will likely be in the near future, with the Arbitrum Foundation and fall within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories, such as SEEDGov in its role as the Delegate Incentive Program Manager, MSS members, firms forming the ADPC, Entropy Advisors, etc., should collaborate closely with OpCo once its operations are fully established and stabilized. Once fully operational, OpCo will have the capacity to project manage and oversee these initiatives according to its complete mandate. The long-term vision for this process is as follows:\n\n1. OpCo’s core team is hired, and operations begin;\n2. OpCo demonstrates product-market fit (i.e., the DAO is satisfied with the entity’s output) and that it has adequate processes, capabilities, and any other relevant functions to execute according to its complete mandate;\n3. OpCo is prepared to oversee full-time DAO operations, assuming existing contributor contracts through novation and managing new initiatives on behalf of the DAO (e.g., by ensuring that appropriate KYC measures and documentation are implemented).\n\nIn the case that an integral facilitator within the Ecosystem Support or Financial Management categories (or any other category OpCo might be mandated to operate within in the future) exits the ecosystem for any reason and an initiative is left without an owner, the DAO could likewise mandate OpCo to find a replacement solution.\n\nIt’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm). OpCo internal full-time employees cannot be contributors to DAO initiatives as individuals (they need to do so through OpCo) and are strictly prohibited from entering into employment engagements with other DAOs, organizations, entities, or comparable affiliations, whilst contractors that facilitate a specific vertical and are signed to OpCo can have engagements in other DAO initiatives and outside of the ecosystem. Full-time OpCo staff can only be appointed internally. However, as mentioned earlier, the DAO can roll any service provider or individual contributor into OpCo by passing an onchain vote. This vote has to request capital to cover the facilitators’ expenses since when it comes to salaries, OpCo’s budget only covers internal full-time staff. OpCo is expected to work closely with Offchain Labs as well as the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that scopes of work do not overlap.\n\nIndividual contributors, service providers, and other analogous entities are naturally free to go directly to the DAO to propose they facilitate a workstream and get paid for it without facilitation by the OpCo. However, if the proposed scope of work falls within OpCo’s mandate, it is expected that delegates vote against such a proposal if it can be better executed via OpCo’s involvement. Proposers will be encouraged to engage with OpCo before posting a proposal to the forum to align with the DAO-adjacent entity’s internal employees. OpCo’s internal employees will also proactively communicate with proposal authors and facilitators outside of OpCo such that there is no overlap between deliverables and the future plans for all initiatives are clear.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to mention that the introduction of a DAO-adjacent legal entity carries risks and burdens that shouldn’t be ignored. Among other things, it requires some trust in a select group of facilitators as they are responsible for hiring and procuring the correct contributors as well as operationalizing and managing the DAO-adjacent entity, OpCo’s setup and fixed costs are quite notable, and some amount of administrative work is required that otherwise wouldn’t have arisen.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## OpCo Operational Process\n\nWe expect the general workflow for OpCo to be as follows:\n\n* A forum discussion is initiated, with the owner of that discussion having communicated with OpCo and defined whether the covered subject falls within OpCo’s initial mandate, i.e., the Financial Management or Ecosystem Support verticals.\n* For verticals that are included in OpCo’s mandate, a discussion could broadly take one of the following forms:\n  * A new key objective is introduced, but the roadmap to achieve that objective is unclear: Delegates have the option to create a Snapshot proposal to direct OpCo to produce an onchain proposal that defines the strategy to achieve the key objective(s), whether the entity would procure a facilitator or hire/operationalize an internal employee, as well as any funds needed to cover the strategy’s expenses, excluding OpCo’s internal employee costs. If approved, OpCo would begin facilitating the proposal created by itself. It’s important to note that OpCo, together with its oversight committee (OAT), is responsible for keeping the DAO informed about the entity’s bandwidth. They’ll also provide updates on when current projects are expected to end. This ensures that if there is a sudden spike in new proposals, especially complex and more time-intensive ones, delegates can prioritize and vote on the ones OpCo can take on.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, but the incentive program’s structure and size are unclear. A proposal is passed for OpCo to operationalize internal employees and create the exact strategy. OpCo then defines, e.g., the amount of incentives to be distributed, what the application process to receive incentives looks like, how success will be measured, etc. A proposal to ratify the strategy, the incentives to be distributed, and the required workforce is then created. If passed, OpCo will activate the needed facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) and strategy execution begins.\n  * A new key objective is introduced and the roadmap to achieve that objective is clear: Delegates approve an onchain proposal that defines the strategy, whether the facilitator is the proposer, proposer-related party, an internal OpCo employee, or someone the OpCo procures, and the related expenses excluding facilitator fees for internal OpCo employees, after which strategy execution begins. If a proposal introduces a new key objective with a clear roadmap but that roadmap is ambitious, the OAT together with OpCo should signal how feasible it is for the entity to execute the proposal. If it’s determined that such a roadmap is feasible, the OAT together with OpCo would also communicate whether or not the entity needs more internal resources to be able to execute.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, and the structure and size are clear. An onchain proposal to ratify the strategy, the facilitators, and the capital needed is then created. If passed, the required facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) are contracted by OpCo, or OpCo operationalizes/hires internal employees, depending on the DAO’s decision, and the strategy is activated.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n* Proposals and their execution can still be DAO-led end-to-end and outside of OpCo if delegates vote in this regard. OpCo is a tool for the DAO to leverage if needed.\n* The DAO-adjacent entity is required to be proactive, meaning that internal employees need to actively give feedback in the forums and participate in opinionated discussions.\n* Furthermore, if OpCo has available bandwidth, it should identify areas within its mandated verticals where improvements could be made. If there is no clear owner for such areas and addressing them would benefit the DAO, OpCo should take action. OpCo can create a proposal to define the strategy for addressing the targeted area, requesting funds to cover expenses, excluding costs for OpCo’s internal employees and other related operating expenses, and authorizing the DAO-adjacent entity to operationalize facilitators to execute the strategy.\n\nOpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee. After OpCo’s core team has been hired, the entity has demonstrated product-market fit and readiness to execute according to its complete mandate, OpCo could be leveraged to help develop a DAO-wide budget, in which case the DAO-adjacent entity could hold the budgeted capital for at least the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management categories. In this case, when proposals related to these verticals are passed, no capital would have to be moved from the treasury as OpCo would be able to cover all expenses from its holdings.\n\n## Establishing OpCo\n\nExploratory work on OpCo’s legal structure has already been initiated, but further effort and consultation with key stakeholders, delegates, legal parties, and the Arbitrum Foundation are needed to hammer down the exact structure. Any costs incurred by the Foundation for setting up the legal structure would be reimbursed from capital allocated to this initiative if this proposal were to pass.\n\nOpCo’s initial term will tentatively be 30 months (around 6 months for setup and 24 months for operations from the entity’s official initiation date). The initial term’s length has been chosen to allow ample time for any unforeseen delays in establishing the legal entity, ramping up and stabilizing its operations, and will enable OpCo to focus on more complex and long-term strategies and internalize top talent as a longer initial term provides predictability/job security for employees. Once the first term is coming to an end, the executive-equivalent internal personnel together with OpCo’s oversight committee—the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), introduced below—are required to collaborate to create the continuation proposal for the DAO-adjacent entity. This is expected to cover, among other things, the second OpCo term’s length, the required budget, and any changes or improvements that should be made. It should be noted that if OpCo is required to internalize a vast amount of facilitator roles before a DAO-wide budget is put in place, OpCo might have to create a proposal that would allocate additional funds as its initial exemplary budget has been constructed to cover up to 12 internal full-time employees at different salaries.\n\nTo enable OpCo to successfully fulfill its mandate, the entity should, among other things, have the following initial operational capabilities, internal employees, and resources:\n\n* Internal Finances, Financial Rails, and Controls\n  * Appoint an external accounting and audit firm to maintain financial records and create yearly audits of financial statements and internal controls.\n  * Banking capabilities to be able to convert stablecoins into fiat currency and pay service providers not accepting tokens.\n* Legal\n  * Hire a full-time, in-house legal counsel.\n  * Obtain the required insurances that cover the DAO-adjacent entity as well as internal employees and the OAT.\n* Business-Critical Software\n  * Acquire any needed collaboration and communication tools, accounting and financial management software, human resources management systems, etc.\n* Internal Executive-Equivalent Employees\n  * Chief Chaos Coordinator\n    * Ensures that OpCo has the required internal resources, employees, and contracted service providers such that the DAO-adjacent entity can operate properly and execute strategies mandated by the DAO.\n    * Responsible for building and advancing the entity’s operational structure and managing workflows as initiatives are rolled into the organization and new focus areas are introduced.\n    * Similarly to other executive-equivalent personnel, accountable for adequate record keeping and internal controls.\n    * Collaborates with any other executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT to produce bi-annual oversight and financial reports.\n    * Together with executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT, in charge of creating the continuation proposal for OpCo’s next term.\n  * Chief of Coins\n    * Works with the relevant parties to produce a detailed, actual budget for OpCo, ratified by the OAT and the DAO. In the future, we expect the Chief of Coins to help facilitate a DAO-wide budget together with the relevant parties.\n    * Before a DAO-wide budget is created, responsible for requesting additional funds to ensure the entity’s operations if capital allocated for OpCo’s OpEx is close to being depleted.\n    * Verifies that allocated funds are custodied in a secure manner and utilized as intended.\n    * Makes sure that the OAT and the DAO have required visibility into ongoing expenses, how financials are expected to develop, and any other relevant considerations.\n    * Monitors Arbitrum’s financial performance and makes new recommendations based on this information.\n    * Closely collaborates with entities and individuals responsible for treasury management-related tasks, enabling the creation of a unified asset allocation and risk diversification strategy in line with the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose.\n    * Manages accounting, payroll, and payment infrastructure.\n\n## OpCo KPIs\n\nWe are looking for community feedback on this front, but some potential, apparent KPIs for OpCo (h/t [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) for most of these) include:\n\n* Talent Acquisition, Service Provider Selection, and Program Management\n  * Decrease in time-to-hire, compared to the DAO’s previous structure\n  * Employee engagement and satisfaction\n  * Retention rate\n  * Share of service providers meeting or exceeding performance metrics\n  * Cost savings or added value generated\n  * Diversity of service providers engaged\n* Ecosystem Coordination\n  * Time to solve open questions and other ambiguities\n  * Number of initiatives facilitated and their success\n  * Level of community engagement and stakeholder satisfaction\n  * Agility in adapting objectives\n  * Share of OpCo-initiated strategies accepted by the DAO\n* Performance Tracking and Transparency\n  * Timeliness of oversight and financial reports\n  * Share of data and metrics made publicly available\n  * Community engagement with reports\n\nUltimately, the OAT will be responsible for designing, finalizing, and implementing the relevant KPIs once OpCo is at a point where this can be sufficiently done. We envision that this will be a collaborative effort between the OAT and the DAO, with KPIs reviewed and adjusted periodically based on how OpCo evolves and the community’s feedback.\n\n## OpCo Accountability – The Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT)\n\nThe OAT is a group of five individuals with the primary mandate to oversee OpCo’s operations, ensure the DAO maintains transparency into the DAO-adjacent entity, function as the coordinator between the DAO and OpCo, and establish clear communication channels with the other committees overseeing the separate DAO-adjacent entities such as the GCP and possibly the CapCo in the future should the DAO vote accordingly. More specifically, the OAT’s responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n\n* Accountability: Ensures that OpCo is not overstepping its mandate, over-hiring doesn’t take place, and execution is constrained solely to strategies approved by the DAO. Holds the executive-equivalent personnel accountable, helps produce and approves bi-annual oversight and financial reports, designs relevant KPIs for OpCo once the entity is at a point where this can be sufficiently done, and gives other quarterly updates to the community (such as how OpCo is progressing towards the KPIs designed by the OAT, any operational developments, etc.), reviews all relevant internal materials, and monitors that funds held in OpCo-related wallets are used correctly.\n* Operational Support: Provides assistance in the entity’s legal setup process, gives guidance on OpCo’s operational development, assists the executive-equivalent personnel in producing a continuation proposal for OpCo, and continuously guides OpCo-related contributors to align with the DAO’s will.\n* Hiring, Termination, & Authorization: The OAT, in collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, would hire the executive-equivalent personnel to the OpCo (the Chief Chaos Coordinator, the Chief of Coins, and any other positions of equivalent responsibility that may be introduced in the future) once the legal entity is established. The OAT will help onboard the executive-equivalent personnel and assist in the creation of a standardized onboarding process for future internal employees such that new hires’ expectations are managed properly. Once the first internal employees are hired, the OAT would act as the approving authority when OpCo enters into contracts with service providers or individual contributors, as well as greenlight salaries, larger spends, expenses, and budgets, having the authority to challenge decisions made within OpCo that may have a material, negative impact. Moreover, the OAT would be empowered to terminate service provider/individual contributor/etc. contracts as well as fire OpCo’s internal staff. If the OAT decides to take such an action, the concerned party will be suspended from their duties, and payments will be halted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Removal of OAT Members: OAT Members may be removed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a violation of a conflict of interest or other OpCo policies. In the event of a violation: (A) an OAT Member may call up an internal vote for removal with a memo detailing the alleged violation; (B) for a vote to remove an OAT Member to pass, it must have at least 4 out of the 5 OAT Members voting in favor; and (C) the ArbitrumDAO may also call for a vote to remove OAT Members at any time pursuant to a Temperature Check vote in accordance with the quorum and voting threshold requirements of a Temperature Check. The OpCo Team has the ability to call for a Temperature Check vote to remove an OAT Member as voted upon by the ArbitrumDAO. (i) The OpCo Team member may flag to another OpCo Team member that an election to remove an OAT Member via a Temperature Check vote is warranted; (ii) If such other OpCo Team member considers the request for removal to be warranted, then the OpCo Team member who originally made the flag may call for a removal election (subject to a 3 day feedback period, followed by a 7 day voting period) as a Temperature Check vote; (iii) In the event that a call to remove fails, the OpCo Team member who called for such Temperature Check vote cannot call another vote for removal for a period of 3 months. The process for electing a replacement for a removed OAT member will be equivalent to how the removed member was elected. I.e., if the removed member was elected through a DAO vote, the replacement member will be elected through a DAO vote. If the removed member was elected by the OAT, the OAT will elect the replacement member. A removed OAT member cannot be reappointed to the OAT. Further details on the OAT election process are given below.\n* Coordination: Actively engage with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to align on deliverables and serve as the liaison between delegates, key stakeholders, the wider DAO, and other DAO-adjacent entities’ oversight committees. The OAT will also initiate a monthly OpCo oversight call for community members to get updates on the most recent developments and for them to have the opportunity to make inquiries. A separate forum section will be created for OpCo.\n\n## OAT Election Process\n\nIf this proposal were to pass Snapshot, the formation of the Oversight and Transparency Committee would commence. The DAO would elect 3 individuals to the OAT, with these individuals then promptly appointing 2 additional members with specialized skill sets to ensure all Arbitrum stakeholders’ interests are represented and the OAT’s proficiencies are varied and complete. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation will be given an observing and non-voting sixth seat on the OAT similar to the GCP. OAT members are expected to be able to contribute at least 10 hours per week to OAT-related tasks.\n\nOAT applicants are required to apply as individuals to increase accountability. Applicants are required to disclose any current or possible future conflicts of interest in their applications, including but not limited to financial, personal, and professional. Applicants are also required to disclose all active contributor roles and payment streams related to the Arbitrum DAO that they, and entities that they have a professional or financial relationship with, have and are receiving. The application process for the 3 DAO-elected members would be initiated soon after the OpCo proposal passes an offchain vote and would run for ~3 weeks. Note that the application period can be extended if the size of the applicant pool is limited. A shutterized, weighted voting system will be utilized on Snapshot, and the 3 applicants with the most votes will be chosen as members of the OAT. The DAO-elected members should then prioritize appointing 2 additional members (required to be individuals as well). The 2 additional members don’t have to be appointed at the same time. The additional members will be added to the OAT optimistically, with the DAO having the ability to reject either/both of the additional members through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). All members will serve until the end of the first OAT term unless removed or they resign.\n\nWhile the same internal OpCo employees as well as contracted service providers and individual contributors will continue in their roles across OpCo’s terms if the DAO-adjacent entity is extended in the future, the OAT’s term is 12 months, with a re-election process initiated when the OAT’s term has around 3 months left. The DAO would again choose 3 members who then appoint 2 additional members. If the new cohort is different from the previous one, the previous OAT members are expected to help onboard the new members when the term is coming to an end. There are no consecutive term limits for OAT members. As the OAT is mandated to assist in OpCo’s setup process, the first OAT term will be slightly longer than subsequent ones since it will include the period from when the initial OAT members are selected to the establishment of the entity, plus 12 months from the entity’s official start date.\n\nAny individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-obseving seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\n# NOTE: Due to Snapshot's character limit and the length of this proposal, the following sections have been omitted from this text compared to the forum post: OAT Applicant Requirements, OAT Compensation Structure, Governance and Compliance Requirements for OpCo, its Internal Employees, and the OAT, OpCo Financials and Costs, Snapshot Voting Structure, and Timeline.

        "body": "## TLDR FOR SNAPSHOT VOTING\n* Previosuly known as Questbook grant program, we are seeking renewal for a third season\n* This third iteration will last 1 year\n* The vote is about renewing the program with the 4 historical domain (New protocols and ideas, Dev Tooling, Gaming, Education+Events) or adding a 5th domain (Orbit)\n* Funding will be $1,500,000 for each of the 4 domains for a total of $6,000,000 excluding opex, plus eventually further $750,000 for the Orbit domain (half budget due to being experimental)\n* JoJo will be the PM, Questbook will be the technological partner, and we will have elections for the 4 domain allocator; for Orbit, if passed, we want to appoint [MaxLomu](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/maxlomu/summary) as domain allocator due to his vision and expertise\n* Assuming this snapshot passes, we will then have a candidacy window period, elections after the Christmas break of the DAO, and then Tally vote toward end of January\n\n## Abstract\nThe Arbitrum Domain Allocator Offerings Grant Program (D.A.O.) has operated for one year across two six-month seasons. The program has evolved and improved based on previous results, growing from its first season, which allocated $250,000 across four domains, to a second season with funding of $1,000,000 per domain.\n\nWe are now proposing a third season that would run for a full year, encompassing the existing four domains (Protocols, Education/Community and Events, Dev Tooling, and Gaming) while potentially adding a fifth domain (Orbit). The vision is to create a modular program where new domains can be integrated over time based on DAO requirements and perceived needs. This new season will also improve tracking of grantee progress after funding and facilitate fast-tracking of exceptional projects into other DAO initiatives, such as Arbitrum Foundation programs and the GCP.\n\nQuestbook will serve as the technical partner of the program, offering their services through the Questbook.app portal.\n\n\n## Season 1 and 2 recap\nSeason 1 of the Grant Program was initiated through an RFC in [April 2023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081?u=jojo), designed to serve four distinct domains: New Protocols and Ideas, Dev Tooling, Education/Community/Events, and Gaming. Following a successful [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65) and [tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) vote along with elections for the four DAs, the program officially launched in October 2023. The team consisted of [JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary), [SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov/summary), [Flook](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/flook/summary), and [Juandi](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/juandi/summary) as Domain Allocators, with [Srijith](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/srijith-questbook/summary) serving as Program Manager.\n\nThe first season operated for six months with a budget of $250,000 per domain, totaling $1 million in funding, and implemented a soft cap of $25,000 per project. In April 2024, the program was [renewed](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98446466630612736687159241204141593794174501692677162686607521796118942563659?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) for Season 2 with the same team but expanded funding to $1,000,000 per domain. The soft cap was increased to $50,000, with proposals exceeding $25,000 requiring evaluation from two Domain Allocators.\n\nSeason 2 has now completed its fund allocation phase and will continue operating at reduced capacity for the next six months to oversee milestone completion and grant disbursement. Bear in mind that Season 2 results are partial from the first 6 months, and it will have its natural end in May 2025.\n\nThe following are the numbers so far achieved:\n\n* **Season 1**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 67\n    * Amount of completed projects: 49 / 73%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 8 / 12%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 6 / 9%\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 4 / 6%\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 207\n    * Amount of completed milestones 178 / 86%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 23 / 11%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $997,793\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $852,781 / 86%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $87,512 / 8.5%\n\n*Note: Uncompleted projects are those currently active but were either unable to complete their proposals within the last six months or pivoted to a different idea. Abandoned projects are from teams that weren't able to operate in the market. Withdrawn projects are those that were approved but decided not to proceed with their grant.*\n*While there was no specific timeline set, we feel Season 1 has come to its natural end, and we are in the process of informing teams and withdrawing remaining funds.*\n\n* **Season 2**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 127\n    * Amount of completed projects: 42 / 33%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 85 / 67%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 0\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 0\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 451\n    * Amount of completed milestones 240 / 53%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 211 / 47%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $2,602,247\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $1,356,181 / 44%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $1,246,066 / 41%\n\nMore details on the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ts3oUeRy5cMp-5ksyld570VhmdjdUEVvtt2VhUYxfc4/edit?gid=1462691949#gid=1462691949).\n\n\n\n## Season 3: overview\n\nIn the last year, and potentially for the next year, the D.A.O. Grant Program has brought and will continue to bring the following value to the DAO:\n\n1. Introductory Grant Program: It fills the gap of Arbitrum Foundation grants (usually starting at $50,000, up to $150,000), serving as an entry-level program in our ecosystem.\n2. Transparency: All applications and judgments are available for everyone to read in the portal. Additionally, discussions with protocols are typically maintained in a public Discord with open access.\n3. Targeted Approach: The program has specialized in four specific verticals deemed key by the DAO\n4. High submission amount: between Season 1 and 2 we managed more than 700 proposals, approving around 200.\n\nWhile these points have always been advocated and envisioned as the natural shape of the program, below is a non-comprehensive list of value propositions that has been provided so far through in the last two seasons of the program:\n\n* Enable new teams and small builders to bootstrap their projects\n* Enable mid and big team to prioritize certain deployment in Arbitrum\n* Support Hackathon and Event winners\n* Provide an alternative funding route alongside the Arbitrum Foundation or direct DAO proposals\n* Support projects building upon targeted DAO initiatives\n* Ensure builder diversity, enlarging indirectly Arbitrum mindshare for local builders.\n\nA few specific examples of what we think can be defined as success stories:\n\n* Season 2 has supported both the [winner](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) and [runner-up](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f30eb1c1eb9145098a15e&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66bbd4ee8868f5130a6ffe57&isRenderingProposalBody=true) of Arbitrum GovHack at EthCC\n* Curia's [Governance Dashboard](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66bdceb58868f5130a8cd78d&isRenderingProposalBody=true), initially [rejected](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x573c74706924ce482080ba44deb77d75e8d6bdb516fbbdee54b78861c1683f1b) by the DAO, has been later approved through the grant program with a 20% cost reduction\n* Pear Protocol, currently trading at $7.5M market cap with a $160M cumulative volume in 60 days in the perp space, received a grant to develop their [API module](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x538&isRenderingProposalBody=true) for market makers\n* Mountain protocol, rwa protocol having around $10M in liquidity in Arbitrum, has [bootstrapped its activity in Arbitrum through a grant ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x4ee&isRenderingProposalBody=true)in Season 1\n* Vyper, a language with an extreme mindshare in the Ethereum community, has seen [support to their compiler in Season 2](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f32a15488d5000f0562b3&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66a4e20af2fef64647207b3d&isRenderingProposalBody=true), which will help securing hundreds of millions in DeFi applications\n* Applications like FairAI's are building on top of initiatives such as LTIPP and STIP.b to improve the [discoverability of projects with incentives](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=663ec3d47d71679fa9a3852c&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n\nIn this new iteration, the DA program will last one year. After two six-month seasons with subsequent renewals, there is sufficient maturity in both the program and the DAO to extend it, reducing the burden on delegates for operational renewal and addressing issues such as gaps between seasons.\n\nFunding will be proportional to Season 2, which effectively allocated $750,000 for each of the four domains for six months: for a one-year program, **the funding for the four domains will be $1,500,000 per domain, for a total of $6,000,000 for the four domains excluding OpEx**. Additionally, after discussions with several delegates and the Foundation, and assessment of the current DAO landscape and working groups, there is interest in a potential fifth domain related to Orbit chains. Acknowledging its experimental nature, the proposal suggests funding this domain with half the amount of other domains: $750,000 for one year.\n\nThe grant structure will remain unchanged. Grantees can request up to $25,000 with a single DA review, and up to $50,000 with two DA reviews. Grants will be paid on a milestone basis, where projects must first complete the milestone, verify it with the DA, and then receive the corresponding portion of the grant. Only in exceptional cases, such as when milestone funds are essential for completion or in situations of economic distress, may the DA, at their discretion, release milestone funds in advance.\n\nUpon completing KYC/KYB, grantees will have up to six months to complete their proposal. If they fail to do so, remaining funds will be retained by the program and either reassigned to new projects or, if the program has naturally concluded, returned to the DAO.\n\nUpon proposal completion, grantees must publish a final report in the Arbitrum forum to inform the general DAO community about their project.\n\nThree months after proposal completion, grantees must complete a survey and publish an update to their final report, aimed at tracking their success, foothold gained in Arbitrum, and adherence to or pivot from their original idea.\n\nBefore completion, a subset of projects will be internally selected by the PM and DAs for fast-tracking through a PM pitch into other ecosystem programs, such as the Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program or the GCP. While this won't necessarily guarantee further grants from these or other entities, it will ensure exceptional protocols can continue their journey and expand within the ecosystem.\n\nWith these modifications, several gaps from previous seasons are addressed:\n\n1. Creating a checkpoint for approved proposals after their final milestone: This will enable better overall tracking of project outcomes.\n2. Integrating exceptional projects into DAO growth programs to establish a clear pathway for continued development within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## Program phases\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibao77we73buy5735xsaeudsadh2j23rpkmclftijsgnwfgin2ndu)\n\nExcluding the initial phases of snapshot discussion, temp check on the proposal, candidacy for DAs, elections for DAs, and on-chain vote, the program is articulated in the following phases:\n1. A first 1 year phase: during these 12 months, funds allocated to the program will be assigned to DAs to the projects that will be evaluated as worth financing. During this phase, the green one in the graph, all the team will operate at full capacity.\n2. A second phase, at low capacity, lasting 6 months: this phase is also effectively already embedded in phase 1. During this 6 months we will assume that there won't be any new fund to distribute from the main phase, and it will be a monitoring one. As stated, grantees, once approved and kyced, will have *up to* 6 months to complete their project. This means that projects approved, for example, in the last legal month of phase 1, will be able to complete their path up to 6 months after the end of phase 1. In this period, the team will work at low capacity, with a 20% cost.\n3. A third phase, potentially extending up to 3 months after the end of phase 2, related to the checkmark of projects after completion. If we consider a project that gets approved in the last month of phase 1, and needs 6 months to arrive to completion (so is completed in the last month of phase 2), we will necessarily have to place the checkmark 9 months after the legal completion of phase 1. Note: there is no opex coverage for this phase, since is effectively based on contacting projects, interviewing them likely with a google form and report in the forum, but only as said for projects that were approved in the last quarter of phase 1 AND that requires 6 months for completion (which is not always the case). This phase will be covered through the team which will have the goodwill of finishing to accompany projects in their path, and could potentially be resolved through the passing of the baton to a new team, or confirmation of the old team, in a season 4.\n\nDuring all of these phases, there will be parallel communication phases related to\n- the communication and reporting of the program in the forum: we need to, indeed, cover this for 12 + 6 + 3 months of the program\n- the communication with Arbitrum Foundation: as stated, upon completion, best of breed projects will be pitched to the AF to have them continue their journey in the Arbitrum ecosystem, either through a grant, or marketing, or any other initiative that the AF might deem necessary, knowing that this internal pitch might not necessarily spark any follow up\n- the communication with GCP, in the same fashion of the AF, once the fund will have their thesis and infrastructure up\n- any communication with any other stakeholder or initiative that might be deemed relevant by the team or the DAO.\n\n## Domains\n\nSo far the program has run with four main domains:\n\n1. New Protocols and Ideas: A general bucket encompassing not only protocols, but also platforms, governance tooling, and other projects not specifically falling into other domains.\n2. Education, Community Growth and Events: A domain focused on physical events and educational material for Arbitrum.\n3. Dev Tooling on One and Nova: A technical domain oriented toward developer tooling and promoting Arbitrum Nova adoption.\n4. Gaming: A domain dedicated to web3 gaming and infra, web3 KOL gaming activities, and all video gaming-related projects.\n\nAll these domains remain pillars of our DAO today, even more so than a year ago. We are, for better or worse (though mostly better), the most accessible DAO in crypto, the first ecosystem to create a gaming fund of the size of GCP, and we have a technology stack that enables permissionless creation of L3s. Our ecosystem's nature and soul, combined with the entry-level grant structure of this program and the diversity we inevitably achieve through it, provides strong justification to maintain all four domains. While most operational changes will be in the framework that moves projects from this program to others, we plan to specify domains based on relevant stakeholders’ feedback (Arbitrum Foundation, OCL, Delegates) to add more specificity and better tailored results.\n\n### Education, Community Growth and Events\n\nThe domain has seen significant attention, receiving the highest number of proposals in both seasons. Through discussions with Foundation members and key stakeholders, two additional focus areas have emerged where the grant program can provide value:\n\nEvents Focus:\n\n* While continuing to serve the broader community, emphasis will be placed on amplifying Arbitrum's presence in key global markets and events\n* This will complement the Foundation's growth efforts in specific regions such as, in random order, SEA, USA, LatAm and others\n* The program will maintain an open approach, not limiting itself to these regions\n* Regular coordination with the Foundation's marketing department will help identify synergies between grantee proposals and events organized by the Foundation or other key ecosystem players\n* The DA will be mindful about any request of grantees for presence of personnel of the Arbitrum Foundation in the events: while this can, in some cases, be accommodated, is not always possible.\n\nDeveloper Relations:\n\n* Increased focus on DevRel content for both One and Stylus\n* Examples include, but are not limited to, video tutorials\n* Goal is to foster technology stack adoption through expanded community-created educational materials\n* This branch can partially overlap with and be covered/complemente by the Dev Tooling domain.\n\nTo reiterate: the domain won’t change its nature to only serve requests such as the one mentioned in the above examples, but might give in some cases more weights in the evaluation as there is value added in coordination with the broad ecosystem. The DA will still retain all its liberty of evaluation.\n\n### Gaming\n\nThe gaming vertical has gained increased attention throughout the year in Arbitrum, partly due to the GCP initiative. Key stakeholders, including OCL, have identified a primary need: Arbitrum Games should begin targeting the web2 gaming industry, creators and gamers.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the grantee budget cap of $50,000 isn't sufficient to attract web2 developers, we can broaden the domain's scope by focusing on user acquisition through initiatives such as:\n\n* Content creation for YouTube and TikTok\n* Twitch streams\n* Other KOL initiatives targeting the web2 gaming segment\n* Grant proposal tuned toward KPI such as amount of reach, target impressions and others\n* Independent publications like newsletters, blogs, and channels.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n* The domain, while expanding, will still maintain its existing focus, which is financing teams to bootstrap or expand web3 games, web3 game related infrastructure and web3 gaming services in the Arbitrum ecosystem while expanding to include these new initiatives\n* Success on the expanded scope will largely depend on selecting a strong candidate or team with specific experience and reach in this segment\n* These requirements will be reflected in the election criteria.\n\n### Dev Tooling on One and Stylus\n\nThe Dev Tooling will undergo changes based on what the Arbitrum ecosystem has achieved, both technologically and in terms of PMF, in the last 12 months.\n\nNova, initially included in the scope, hasn’t seen the forecasted adoption. At the same time we have seen a big conviction bet on Stylus.\n\nWhile it doesn’t make sense to exclude specifically Nova, it can’t be anymore one of the focus of the domain, which will be now called \"Dev Tooling on One and Stylus,\" incorporating the recent Stylus release. There shouldn’t be any consistent overlap with the current year-long \"Stylus Spring\" program for several reasons:\n\n* Different funding amounts (up to $50,000 in DA program vs. potentially $200-500,000 for Stylus Sprint)\n* Different application windows (always open in DA program vs. 8-weeks application period in Stylus Spring)\n* Broader scope (Dev Tooling domain will likely continue to primarily operate on Arbitrum One).\n\nThe rubric will also be modified to put emphasis on Telegram’s tooling such as trading bots, fairly available in other ecosystems but less widespread in Arbitrum.\n\n### New Protocols and Ideas\n\nThe \"New Protocols and Ideas\" domain will remain the most general capture-oriented domain, as it has been in the last two seasons. Its inherent generality enables it to cover both classic ideas, like financing DeFi protocols, and DAO-specific needs like governance tooling. This domain will remain largely unchanged, except for maintaining constant alignment with the Foundation and other stakeholders on what is considered important and valuable when assigning grants. Additionally, there will be attention paid to the evolving narratives driving the broader market.\n\n### Orbit Chains\n\nThere has been growing interest in a possible fifth domain related to Orbit chains. Many delegates have shown interest in or directly requested funding for an Orbit chains program, which is also supported by the existing [working group](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-as-the-home-of-builders-embracing-chain-abstraction/27250?u=jojo).\n\nThe Orbit Chains domain will have the mission to:\n\n* Enable Arbitrum protocols to expand their dApps to specific Orbit chains\n* Deploy technological solutions aimed at addressing current user experience fragmentation\n* Bootstrap solutions built on top of the [2024-2025 Offchain Labs roadmap](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/your-chain-your-rules-offchain-labs-technical-roadmap-to-fuel-arbitrum-innovation-f787f2e85966).\n\nThe Orbit chain domain won’t cover the deployment of new Orbit chains, since this is a mission that is currently facilitated by the Foundation. This doesn’t mean that a project can’t have, in its milestone, the deployment of its own chain if that is part of a broader plan; but this can’t be the main focus of the proposal.\n\nThe rubric and template will be drafted in detail with the elected team member, following the same process used for the other domain rubrics ([1](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66f2dec58868f5130ac75e42), [2](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32), [3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt), [4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)).\n\nAcknowledging that the DAO might consider it premature to launch an Orbit domain, particularly before seeing results from the related working group, the snapshot will provide an option to exclude it from the current program. This domain could then be integrated later during the program's one-year duration.\nAs for the current iteration, we propose [MaxLomu](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/maxlomu/summary) as lead for the Orbit domain. While we can accommodate the DAO's preference for elections in this domain, we believe there would be no better lead than him, given his background and current working group proposal.\n\n## Modularity\n\nSeveral parties have expressed interest in adding new domains to the DA program.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be wise to expand the program further at this time, new domains might be needed at different intervals, as illustrated by the Orbit domain example, where the DAO might require a new domain program six months from now. For this reason, Season 3 is designed to be modular.\n\nIf the DAO votes to allocate capital for a new domain, it can be integrated into the current program by leveraging the existing infrastructure and Program Manager. The costs for adding domains would vary based on specific implementation requirements:\n\n* For domains requiring no additional Questbook expansion and maintaining equivalent PM workload:\n  * Platform costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * PM costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * One new Domain Allocator required\n\nNote that:\n\n* New programs may operate with their own independent teams\n* Integration of the Orbit Chains domain, whether at the start of Season 3 or later, will not incur additional costs\n\n## What does success look like\n\nEvaluating success for an entry-level grant program can be challenging. The evaluation primarily focuses on three key metrics:\n\n1. **Number of Grant Applications**: The program has grown over the past two seasons with increased proposal submissions. We expect to maintain or exceed this level of interest. This KPI should be primarily compared to Season 2's metrics, as Season 1 had both lower funding and a lower cap ($25,000).\n2. **Grant Completion Rate**: As an entry-level program serving primarily small and new teams, the risk of incomplete projects is higher compared to more mature programs. The completion rate will largely depend on DAs' judgment in approving teams they trust to deliver. This metric should also be benchmarked against Season 2's performance for consistent comparison.\n3. **Long-term Project Sustainability**: A new metric will track how many teams are still building on their original project and remaining on Arbitrum three months after grant completion. As this is a new measurement not present in previous seasons, we won't have comparative data unless we retroactively measure Season 2 projects in nine months.\n\n## Election Process\n\nThe election process will follow established best practices as outlined in the [Code of Conduct](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2e701a942a8ed6f9ec8302cea866ab08648eeef0d07170814e3a3c3eb4e48415):\n\n* Two-week candidacy period\n* Candidates (person, entity or team) may apply for only one domain\n* Entities or Teams applying for any domain must designate a single individual as their point of contact\n* One-week snapshot election with shielded option enabled and weighted voting.\n\n## Resignation of DAs and PMs\n\nIn recognition that one year is a relatively long period for a DAO's program, procedures must be established for cases where team members cannot complete their tenure. If a member resigns, they will assist with the transition, and the team will attempt to source a replacement. A snapshot vote will be held with two options: \"Yes, proceed with the new member\" or \"No, hold elections.\"\n\nIf approved, the new member will be onboarded to the team. If rejected, a standard election process will occur over three weeks (two weeks for candidacy, one week for voting). During any transition period where the former member cannot fulfill their duties, the current DAs and PM will temporarily manage the domain, including grantee collaboration, proposal evaluation, and milestone payments. Any compensation due to the departing member during this interim phase will be fairly distributed among contributing team members.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe RFC will request $1,500,000 for each of the four domains \"New Protocols and Ideas\", \"Education, Community Growth and Events\", \"Dev Tooling on One and Nova\", and \"Gaming\", for a total amount of $6,000,000 excluding OpEx. The requested amount will be in ARB and, upon receiving, will be converted into USDC.\n\nEarmarked costs are as follows:\n\n* Questbook Platform: $84,000 total ($7,000/month for 12 months)\n  * Includes platform maintenance\n  * Synapse subscription for KYC/KYB of teams and grantees\n  * DocuSign subscription\n* Domain Allocator Compensation: $422,400 total\n  * $8,000/month for 12 months (four DAs)\n  * Plus $1,600/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n* Program Manager Compensation: $85,800 total\n  * $6,500/month for 12 months\n  * Plus $1,300/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n* Legal Expenses: $30,000 earmarked\n\nTotal operational costs: $622,200\n\nIf the Orbit Chains domain is added as a fifth domain:\n\n* Additional $750,000 to total budget\n* DA compensation of this domain remains unchanged\n* No additional PM or platform costs\n* Total program cost would increase to $727,800.\n\n*Note: If approved, JoJo will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2 at the start of Season 3. Similarly, if any of the current Domain Allocators will participate in the elections and will be re-elected, they will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2.*\n\n## Reporting\n\nA more clear and standardized reporting will take place going forward. Specifically\n\n* The PM will report, once per month, in the Arbitrum Governance call\n  * This type of reporting might change format and/or schedule: if the DAO is interested, for example, it could be a specific DA call, or it might fall into any of the new governance DAO’s calls that we could change or spin up in future\n* The PM and the DAs will publish, once per month, a single unified report highlighting the status of the program\n* All grantees, of all domains, at completion will have to publish a report in the Arbitrum forum\n* All grantees will have to follow up the aforementioned report, after three months, with a survey prepared to understand the effectiveness of both the grant itself and the idea from the team, including but not only understanding if the team has decided to keep building in Arbitrum, expanding in other chains etcetera.\n\n## Vote specification\n\nThe DAO vote on Snapshot will be a single choice vote:\n\n* Yes: renew the program with $7,477,800 and 5 domains\n* Yes: renew the program with $6,622,200 and 4 domains\n* No: don’t renew the program\n* Abstain\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n* 19th of November: RFC for Season 3 and discussion with the DAO\n* 5th of December: Snapshot for Season 3\n* 16th of December - 5th of January: candidacy for the domains\n* 9th of January - 16th of January: Snapshot elections for the domains\n* 23rd of January - 6th of February: Tally voting\n* First half of February: refinements of rubrics with the new team\n* Mid February: start of the program\n\n## Fund Management\n\nARB received from Tally, with a 35% buffer, will be transferred to the Arbitrum Foundation for the conversion in USDC of only the amount approved; any ARB surplus will be returned to the DAO. Upon completion, funds will be split as per the following\n\n* OpEx safe: managed by the MSS, it will be in charge of payment of suppliers and partners (Questbook, Synapse) and salaries\n* Domains’ safes: managed by PM + DAs, one for each vertical with a 2/3 setup (the PM, the main DA, and a second different DA), will be linked to the specific domain through the Questbook website and will be used to disburse the grants. The safes will have the Zodiac Module for the clawback of funds.\n\n## Resources\n\n[Season 1 RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081)\n[Season 2 RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326)\n[Season 2 update thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-update-thread/23672)\n[New Protocols and Ideas RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/120s88WVycDyP2pUfgcT0eE8ILuribuayHDnd5aeZxbM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4th1bgre9sv4)\n[Education, Community Growth and Events RFP](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32)\n[Gaming RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt),\n[Dev Tooling on One and NOVA RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)",

        "body": "**Note:** This proposal is a revised version of our initial draft shared for discussion on November 30th. In reality, it represents the 3rd proposal after incorporating valuable feedback from community members and key delegates. Below are the links attached for previous proposals.\n\n**1st Proposal (June 2024):** [Proposal Link](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-arbitrumhub-evolution-the-next-step-in-streamlining-information-access-and-raising-awareness-for-arbitrum-dao/24857)  \n- **Outcome:** Failed in Snapshot voting  \n- **Community Feedback:** Lacked clear KPIs and a detailed budget breakdown.\n\n**2nd Proposal (November 2024, RFC):** [Proposal Link](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/non-constitutional-proposal-for-maintenance-and-continuous-enhancement-of-arbitrumhub-to-meet-the-evolving-needs-of-the-arbitrum-ecosystem-and-dao/27667)  \n- **Community Feedback:** Its scope and deliverables were deemed too broad. The feedback emphasized the need to narrow the focus, streamline the deliverables, and \n    reduce the budget. Emphasis was placed on prioritizing content quality and platform maintenance.\n\nWe believe the feedback have played a crucial role in refining our approach and finding the key strategic way for establishing ArbitrumHub as a robust Platform.\n\n### Key Resources:\n- **ArbitrumHub Platform:** [Visit Platform](https://www.arbitrumhub.io/)\n- **ArbitrumHub Research Document:** [View Document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XrYF2L30tS4paZs1xwVBagd2BXcH66A2/view) (*Note:* This file is large and may take some time to load. We appreciate your patience.)\n- **GitHub Open-Source Code:** [Access Code](https://github.com/HoomanDigital/ArbitrumDAO_Hub)\n- **Looker Studio Link (for Tracking Platform Analytics):** [View Analytics](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/f0081ef4-8322-4ba7-b685-afcc38547bb8/page/u9hPE)\n\n## Things to Consider While Analyzing the Platform:\nPlease note that some information on the platform may not always be entirely accurate or up-to-date, primarily due to resource constraints. From the past year, we have independently built, managed and maintained the platform using the resources at our disposal. Despite these limitations, we strive to provide the most accurate and updated information, deploying any additional resources to improve its quality.  \nWe encourage you to view this platform as a **proof of concept** for what we aim to achieve. Imagine the possibilities we could unlock with dedicated support and resources from the DAO. The DAO support would enable us to significantly enhance this platform and fully realize its potential.\n\n## DAO Feedback Addressed\nBased on feedback from the DAO, we are considering carrying ArbitrumHub as a pilot for the first year with a limited scope. The core focus will be on addressing content needs and refining the platform based on community feedback, DAO needs while utilizing minimal resources.\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Core Focus on Platform Maintenance:** Prioritizing ongoing platform maintenance and updates over expansion.\n- **Reduced Fragmentation:** We are adopting a focused approach to streamline efforts and consolidate resources, ensuring a strong foundation for ArbitrumHub.\n- **Minimal Resources:** Operating with a minimal resource allocation to ensure efficient use of funds and focus on core needs.\n\n### MSS Setup for Fund Request:\n- **Quarterly Fund Withdrawals:** Funds will be withdrawn on a quarterly basis from the MSS.\n- **Initiative Termination Clause:** The initiative may be stopped if the DAO reaches a consensus that the proposed value is not being delivered at any point.\n\n## Comparison Between Foundation site and ArbitrumHub:\nThe Foundation is one of the bodies of the Arbitrum DAO, focused primarily on providing specific information aimed at builders. Their goal is to make the Arbitrum blockchain more efficient. The Foundation's target audience includes developers and builders, with an emphasis on onboarding them to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nIn contrast, ArbitrumHub provides a comprehensive overview of all Arbitrum DAO initiatives, including governance and various ecosystem activities. Our target audience includes individuals involved in governance, Web3 service organizations, strategists, and community members from arbitrum and other DAOs, as well as anyone interested in understanding what Arbitrum has to offer.\n\nAdditionally, ArbitrumHub serves as a platform to showcase community initiatives on a single platform, ensuring better visibility and reach. For instance, the Community Hub serves as a space to highlight community-driven contributions—something that is currently lacking within the Arbitrum ecosystem. ArbitrumHub is fulfilling this need by providing a dedicated space for these initiatives and enhancing the accessibility to everyone.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that the Foundation's website is effective in its purpose, we recognize that the Foundation has a distinct goal and target audience. The Foundation’s internal focus is on improving the Arbitrum blockchain for builders, while their external focus revolves around onboarding builders to the Arbitrum blockchain and presenting relevant information accordingly.\n\n### Foundation Focus:\n- **Internal Focus:** Enhancing the Arbitrum blockchain for builders.\n- **External Focus:** Onboarding builders to the Arbitrum blockchain, with information presented in a way that caters specifically to their needs.\n\n![258d08ba92894870e422a8833fd31aa2d8e6780c_2_592x300[1].jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiav5jw2ddwbev2hgav6tbqpbpavjeqoqzcrx22e6p3zg5b6ybbvx4)\n**Note:** The image above represents the bi-annual progress report, highlighting the scope and target audience of the Arbitrum Foundation. It illustrates how ArbitrumHub complements the Foundation's efforts rather than duplicating them. In fact, ArbitrumHub has previously been utilized by the Foundation to showcase various grant programs and accepted projects. ArbitrumHub aims to serve as a comprehensive, one-stop solution for all things arbitrum.

Abstract\n\nThe ArbitrumHub project emerged from over a year of active involvement in the Arbitrum ecosystem, during which we identified a critical need for a unified platform for ArbitrumDAO. Through extensive community engagement, research, and participation in DAO meetings, it became evident that new members, centralized organizations, participants from other DAOs, and young enthusiasts lacked a single point of reference for all developments and initiatives within the ecosystem. To address this gap, we began laying the foundation of ArbitrumHub 1+ year ago. With dedicated research, collaboration with key stakeholders, and a project team committed to design, development, and iteration, ArbitrumHub has evolved into a comprehensive resource at [arbitrumhub.io](https://www.arbitrumhub.io).\n\n![9639757fe0e675e465f7d87a94665d1d575179b0_2_790x750[1].jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibsiuffn6v3v6t7ylxctfduy3ueoxe3ptp6bs3wg7eozdedt5c5b4)\n\n# 2. Motivation\n\nArbitrumHub was created to address the critical need for a centralized resource hub within the ArbitrumDAO community. As the ecosystem expands, it becomes increasingly challenging to stay informed and connected. ArbitrumHub simplifies this process by offering a single, reliable source of essential information, structured in a way that is both accessible and comprehensive. \nArbitrumHub aspires to become the community’s go-to destination for vital insights into ArbitrumDAO and its ongoing initiatives. By maintaining a unified platform, we ensure community members and external participants have access to updates, meeting details, and opportunities to engage with the ecosystem. This approach not only strengthens community involvement but also fosters a more informed and engaged Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n![44b5eceefda5f291ee82b2e86e425ba132f416dd_2_936x630[1].png](ipfs://bafybeieazvqjqvatfzetoiodvu25slxhhgsat7xazfw552jecmbmzl3y6a)\n\n\n# 3. Rationale for DAO Approval\n\nArbitrumHub serves as the essential first point of contact for existing and new users in the Arbitrum ecosystem, consolidating scattered information and providing a continuously updated resource. Given the importance of this platform in fostering ecosystem cohesion and accessibility, we are seeking DAO approval to formalize ArbitrumHub’s role within the ArbitrumDAO structure.\n\nSecuring DAO support would allow us to designate ArbitrumHub as a DAO-backed platform, which we can publicly display in the About section on ArbitrumHub.io, reinforcing its credibility and trust within the ecosystem. Formal approval would also enable a closer working relationship with DAO program managers and delegates, establishing an ongoing feedback loop and creating a foundation for designing and implementing effective Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with key stakeholders. This formalized connection ensures that ArbitrumHub remains aligned with the DAO’s strategic objectives, enhancing the platform’s long-term impact and value to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n![43e45b56a1b48ce31882a32c80856120148c22c8_2_936x724[1].png](ipfs://bafybeicsou6sovh3a6gsnqto3m7speh5nfvshxp6kg5qqfemwaqi7zbkcu)\n\n\n# 4. Key Uses of ArbitrumHub\n\nArbitrumHub is a centralized and open-source platform designed to streamline user access to essential resources, real-time updates, and community engagement within the Arbitrum ecosystem.

        "title": "The Watchdog: Arbitrum DAO's Grant Misuse Bounty Program",
        "author": "0xb4c064f466931B8d0F637654c916E3F203c46f13",
        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO has allocated over 422m ARB tokens across various initiatives, including incentive programs, grants, investment vehicles, and service providers, amounting to a total spend in the nine-figure USD range. While these allocations have driven significant growth and innovation, there has been minimal oversight or review of how these funds are ultimately used, and no system currently exists to incentivize the identification and reporting of fund misappropriation. Although three instances of misuse have been uncovered, it is likely that additional cases remain undetected.\n\nIn response, Entropy Advisors proposes the **establishment of a grant misuse bounty program dubbed “The Watchdog”** to incentivize the identification and reporting of misused DAO-allocated funds. The program would utilize an incentive mechanism to reward community contributors and investigators who submit verifiable reports of misappropriation. If the proposal passes a temperature check, Entropy will manage a selection process to determine a suitable platform to host the Watchdog program.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nBy offering financial rewards for valid reports of misappropriation, there will be a stronger motivation for community members to contribute skills or information that aid in identifying misconduct in the DAO. Today, the identification of wrongdoing can result in retaliation, unnecessary friction within the DAO, and other negative externalities for the investigators. Moreover, with no incentive to bring forth allegations, it is unlikely that most community members would do so. The Watchdog program creates a decentralized force of accountability, augmenting the DAO’s capacity to detect abuse that would likely otherwise go unnoticed while protecting the submitter from repercussions.\n\nArbitrum DAO’s successful identification of misappropriated funds, whether by a service provider, protocol, grant recipient, or anyone else that receives funds from Arbitrum DAO has two large benefits:\n\n1. The DAO (mainly through the Foundation, as it has done so in the [past](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-announcement-multisig-returns-leftover-funds/26383)) may be able to recapture some of the funds. This could involve legal avenues, smart contract enforcement (clawbacks / stream stopping), or community pressure.\n2. The evidence can be used to identify possible improvement opportunities in the underlying programs and make more informed decisions surrounding the recognized bad actors in the future.\n\nOther benefits include a mechanism for malicious action deterrence and bringing sophisticated onchain sleuths into the DAO.\n\nJust the existence of a transparent and well-publicized bounty program will likely deter some malicious actors from misusing DAO funds in the first place. Knowing that the community has the tools and incentives to identify misallocation increases the risk of exposure for those who might consider abusing the DAO’s trust. Recipients of DAO funds will need to think twice before acting maliciously or in a way that doesn’t align with the DAO’s strategic objectives, rules, and the broader interests of Arbitrum.\n\nBy allowing anyone to submit evidence-based reports of misuse anonymously, the program empowers the entire Arbitrum and crypto ecosystem to take an active role in maintaining the financial health and integrity of the Arbitrum DAO. We hope this fosters a culture of vigilance, good intentions, and accountability while bringing white-hat actors into the ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Watchdog program will extend to ALL DAO-funded initiatives including end recipients of other programs such as the Questbook Domain program, Stylus Sprint, Arbitrum Foundation grants, and the incentives programs. The process for rewarding those who successfully identify fund misuse will start with a temporary solution utilizing a small committee of reviewers with a long-term plan for the program to eventually fall under OpCo, if and when it is stood up.\n\nEntropy proposes the following definition of misuse of funds:\n\n*Any action or inaction by a recipient of DAO-allocated funds that directly violates the stated terms, objectives, agreement, or overall spirit of the allocation under which those funds were provided.*\n\nMisuse definitions and examples below are included solely as a point of reference for the DAO and all decisions surrounding severity will be at the full discretion of the committee:\n\n* **Low:** Cases where there is minor misuse of DAO-allocated funds with limited impact on the DAO’s overall financial health, reputation, or strategic goals.\n  * Example: A Questbook domain allocator accidentally sent a double payment for a milestone and the recipient did not report it.\n  * Example: A grant recipient uses a portion of the funds for unauthorized purposes, such as non-DAO-aligned marketing, travel, or administrative overhead not included in the grant proposal.\n* **Medium:** Cases involving significant misuse of DAO-allocated funds that impact the DAO’s resources or strategic goals, but where the misuse is still recoverable, or partial results have been delivered.\n  * Example: An incentive program recipient uses funds in a way that does not benefit end users, but is a step away from outright theft and fraud.\n  * Example: A grant recipient diverts a significant portion of the funds (e.g., 50k+ ARB) to unrelated projects or personal use.\n* **High:** Cases involving large-scale, deliberate misuse of DAO-allocated funds.\n  * Example: A fund-recipient fabricates deliverables to obtain funds without working on the approved project, then disappears with the entire grant.\n  * Example 2: Theft or unauthorized transfers, such as if MSS members purposefully diverted funds to a recipient not eligible.\n\nThe workflow for Watchdog reports will be as follows:\n\n**1. Report Submission**\n\n* Anyone (watchers) can identify potential misuse of funds that originated from the DAO and submit an evidence-based report to a designated section on a to-be-determined bounty platform. Throughout the entire process, the identity of the submitter will remain private. As detailed further in step 3, the report will only be made public to the DAO in the instance that attempts at backchannel communications with the alleged party fail and a DAO ban is constituted or on a case-by-case basis where the committee deems it prudent to make the DAO aware of the misuse.\n* Reports will follow a standard template to help streamline the review process and collect the initial necessary information.\n\n**2. Review Process**\n\n* A whitelisted group of three DAO-associated reviewers will have the ability to review the submitted reports. We propose the group of initial reviewers to comprise the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and the elected Research Member of the ARDC. This structure minimizes the operating costs of the program until OpCo is stood up., Entropy and the Arbitrum Foundation will be waiving payment as reviewers. The ARDC Research Member will be paid at their stated hourly rate, with funds coming from the ARDC V2 budget. We anticipate the review process for a Watchdog report to take a minimal amount of hours.\n* The three reviewers will discuss reports and, if required, contact the concerned party for clarifications. If two or more reviewers agree (at their discretion) that the submission is based on substance and misuse has occurred, the watcher(s) will receive the bounty. The reviewers will also determine the level of severity of the misuse (Low, Medium, High), which will impact the bounty reward as outlined in step 4.\n* In the case that 2 or more reviewers deem there has been fund misuse, the Arbitrum Foundation will open up private channels of communication with the concerned party and attempt to get the funds back for the DAO.\n* Reviewers are required to abstain from specific review processes if a conflict of interest (COI) is identified. If two or more reviewers have an identified COI, the reviewers will identify two external parties who don’t have COIs and have the capabilities to review the report. If the report is made public, the reviewers’ identified COIs will be published at the same time. To reduce the need for an additional election process and budgeted compensation, Entropy suggests utilizing the soon-to-be-elected Domain Allocators from the D.A.O. program, MSS members, and the other ARDC V2 members for the short list of trusted community members to step in if multiple COIs exist.\n\n**3. DAO Forum & Snapshot Voting**\n\n* If all attempts at backchanneling are failed, the report will be posted to the forum with all the watcher’s personal and identifiable information redacted in the version posted publicly. On a case by case basis, the committee may decide to post a summary of the report to inform the DAO of the misuse. Otherwise individual reports will not be posted to the forum directly. It is Entropy’s belief that in instances of low misuse, it is unwise to subject teams to public scrutiny for what could be a common or minor error.\n* The DAO will vote via Snapshot on whether or not the violation constitutes a DAO ban. Delegates can reference the Furucombo [instance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/potential-misuse-of-funds-furucombo/25496) as an example.\n* The Foundation will determine in which instance of legal recourse is viable. This will be dependent on the size of funds involved in the misuse and legal jurisdiction of the accused party.\n\n**4. Reward Mechanism**\n\n* If the review committee deems a report valid at their discretion, they will deem what level of misuse. A certain level of subjectivity has been introduced due to the wide range of programs that the Watchdog program will cover. A mix of factors will be taken into account the level of severity. These include, but are not limited to the total amount of funds involved, how the funds were used (ex. simple error or intentional fraud), if the misuse is rectifiable, and/or the level of damage to the Abitrum ecosystem/brand.\n  * **Low:** 1k ARB base payout + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $10k\n  * **Medium:** 10k ARB base payout + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $20k\n  * **High:** 30k ARB + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $100k\n* A fixed reward has been included to ensure that an incentive always exists for community members and individuals to submit reports. The base payouts denominated in ARB will come from the approved Watchdog budget.\n* If recaptured funds are denominated in a volatile asset, the maximum reward awarded to the watcher will be calculated as the 30D TWAP of the underlying asset on the day the transfer is made. For clarity, the reward is still paid out in the recovered asset.\n* While anyone is encouraged to submit reports, only watchers that complete a KYC with the Foundation will be eligible for rewards.\n* The program will run until the 400K ARB is exhausted from valid misuse reports. Once 100k ARB remains, a proposal will be put forward to the DAO to extend the budget or shut down the program.\n\nWe believe that this mechanism is optimal for the time being, but if/once OpCo is stood up, the program could be moved into its domain. If done so, the reviewer and voting mechanism would likely need to be restructured.\n\nThe expectation will be that 6 months post program launch, Entropy Advisors will raise a subsequent vote to the DAO in order to gauge the program's success. At this point the DAO can determine if the program should continue in its current state, be moved under OpCo if or when it is stood up, or if the program should be discontinued. Entropy will provide a retrospective report near the end of the 6-month trial to help the DAO evaluate the successfulness of the program. The report will summarize the received misuse cases along with data such as total amount of misuse, severity breakdowns, and amount of ARB recovered.\n\n### Steps to Implement: RFP Process\n\nIt will be necessary to create a secure platform where community members or contributors can privately submit their reports. This will ensure confidentiality and data security for all parties involved. With the requirements resembling a bug bounty program, we imagine that an existing platform can quickly build the necessary portal. If the proposal passes a temperature check, Entropy will directly contact potential providers and solicit bids that will be publicly posted in a dedicated subcategory in the forum. Delegates will have visibility into the bids, but Entropy will conduct negotiations, select the provider, and present a summary of the rationale to the DAO prior to the proposal moving to Tally. Unless the DAO feels strongly about being involved in the selection process, our team views this as the simplest and quickest route to choosing a provider. The Arbitrum Foundation will serve as the counterparty for the agreement.\n\nEntropy refrained from setting a maximum budget at this stage as to not publicly signal to interested providers what amount the DAO would be willing to pay. Additionally, depending on whether the portal needs to be built from scratch or simply added to an existing platform, the costs may vary greatly.\n\n## Budget\n\nIn total 400,000 ARB + the necessary amount of ARB for the selected bounty platform (determined by RFP process) will be sent to a new MSS multisig in order to facilitate the program.\n\n* 400,000 ARB available to reward valid Watchdog reports.\n* Amount of ARB necessary to build and host the Watchdog program. To be determined through a RFP process.\n\n## Timeline\n\nDecember 20th: Forum post\nJanuary 16th-23rd: Snapshot vote\nJanuary 24th : Procurement process begins\nTBD: Onchain Vote\nTBD: Program is launched\n\n## Voting Options\n\nWith the RFP process happening pre-Tally ratification, the Snapshot vote will be subjected to the non-constitutional quorum requirements of 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain.\n\nIt will be a basic vote with FOR, AGAINST, and ABSTAIN as the three options.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nOutside of being placed as one of the three reviewers, Entropy does not have any other conflicts of interest to disclose as part of this proposal.",
