This testnet deployment was done for testing purposes by the @AaveCompanies team.\n\nSince ZkEVM is EVM-equivalent, deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work.\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative supports L2 diversity as part of its governance platform.\n\nThis minimal Aave V3 deployment, with strictly limited assets onboarding (”MVP V3”), can be an opportunity to establish a strategic Aave presence early in this new network while staying conservative in terms of risk.\n\nThis ARFC proposal should be considered as a \"temperature check\" that would allow development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the zkEVM network.\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to “temp check” the deployment of a MVP version of Aave V3 on the ZkEVM L2.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe proposal to deploy Aave V3.0.1 on the ZkEVM L2 network, also known as \"MVP V3,\" presents an opportunity for Aave Governance to establish a strategic presence on this new network early on. Aave has a history of pioneering in new frontiers, starting with the Polygon & Avalanche V2 deployment in 2021.\n\nZkEVM is an L2 solution developed by the Polygon team that is EVM-equivalent. Deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work. However, to reduce risk, the proposal suggests limiting asset onboarding and setting conservative risk parameters. This will enable development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the ZkEVM network. The proposal recommends onboarding only three collaterals (WETH, WMATIC & USDC) and one borrowable asset (USDC) to reduce risk exposure.\n\nIt is important to note that the presented risk parameters should be considered as suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\nThis proposal also lays the groundwork for an \"MVP\" L2 GHO facilitator if governance considers this option in the future.\n\nOverall, this proposal has the potential to expand Aave's reach in the DeFi space by allowing it to expand to new \"frontier\" networks.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy an “MVP V3” of Aave V3.0.1 with only three collaterals: WETH, WMATIC & USDC, and only one borrowable asset: USDC.\n\n| Risk Parameter | WETH | MATIC | USDC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES |\n| Stable borrowing | N/A | N/A | NO |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 65% | 82.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 70% | 85% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 10% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | 20,000,000 |\n| Supply Cap | 25,000 | 15,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 7% | 6.1% | 4% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% | 75% | 90% |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 100% | 60% |\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by Polygon for publishing this AFRC.\n\nHowever, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, is a compensated DeFi strategy advisor for the Polygon Foundation. Although this AFRC is not specifically part of his role, it could be interpreted as such.\n\nAs part of its delegate platform, the ACI promotes L2 diversity.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Marc Zeller holds MATIC, the native asset of the Polygon protocol, and MaticX, a LSD of MATIC, as well as significant holdings on the Polygon POS blockchain, worth approximately $250k.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",

This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.\n\n## **Motivation**:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**:\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with the following assets for collateral: CAKE, BNB, BTCB, WETH, USDC, and USDT. The table below provides the suggested risk parameters for each asset.\n\n|Risk Parameter|CAKE|BNB|BTCB|WETH|USDC|USDT|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|YES|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|NO|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|NO|NO|NO|NO|YES|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|55.00%|70.00%|70.00%|80.00%|77.50%|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|61.00%|75.00%|75.00%|82.50%|80.00%|80.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|5.00%|5.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|20.00%|20.00%|15.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,800,000|42,000|115|3,300.00|20,000,000*|20,000,000*|\n|Supply Cap|5,300,000|46,000|210|6,000.00|50,000,000*|50,000,000*|\n|Debt Ceiling|$10,000,000|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Stable Borrowing|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|uOptimal|45%|45%|45%|80%|90%|80%|\n|Base|0%|0%|0%|1%|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|7%|7%|3.80%|4%|4%|\n|Slope2|300%|300%|300%|80%|60%|75%|\n\n## **Deployment Checklist:**\n\n- Risk service providers feedback ✔\n- BGD Labs [Infrastructure/technical evaluation Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bnb-chain-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/13752)  ✔ \n- Oracle recommendation ✔ ([Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=bnb-chain))\n- The graph support ✔\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance  ✔ \n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~70$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Integrate BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 BNB.\n\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Aave V3 Deployment on Base\n\nAuthor: @fig - Flipside Crypto\n\nDate: 07-27-2023\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nThis ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave V3 on the Base upon Mainnet launch, expanding Aave’s presence and tapping into the future growth, budding DeFi ecosystem, and unique users home to Base.\n\n## **Abstract:**\n\nWhen / if approved by the Aave community, Aave V3 will be deployed on Base Mainnet with a selection of assets for collateral, including wETH, wstETH, cbETH, and USDC. \n\nThis deployment aims to expand Aave to a new ecosystem, capturing the growth and infrastructure allowed by Coinbase’s products and distribution -- providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.\n\n## **Motivation:**\n\nBy enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.\n\nThis allows Aave to leverage Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to 110mm+ users and $80B+ assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.\n\nFor Base, deploying Aave V3's codebase expands the on-chain experience by fostering a diversity of DeFi platforms and introducing trusted, flagship lending protocols.\n\n## **Specification:**\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on Base with the following assets for collateral: wETH, wstETH, cbETH, and USDC. \n\nThe table below illustrates the initial suggested risk parameters for each asset, a combination of reccomendations provided by @Gauntlet and @ChaosLabs.\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|wstETH|USDC|cbETH|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Emode Category|eth-correlated|eth-correlated|N/A|eth-correlated|\n|Loan To Value|80%|80%|82.5%|75%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|82.5%|85%|77.5%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|7.5%|5%|7.5%|\n|Reserve Factor|15%|15%|10%|15%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|10%|10%|\n|Supply Cap|200|100|1,000,000|100|\n|Borrow Cap|160|20|800,000|20|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|uOptimal|80%|45%|90%|45%|\n|Base|0%|0%|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|3.8%|4.5%|3.5%|7%|\n|Slope2|80%|80%|60%|300%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|Disabled|Disabled|\n|Flahloanable|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Siloed Borrowing|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|NO|NO|YES|NO|\n\n\n\n## **Deployment Checklist:**\n\n* Feedback from at least one Risk Service Provider: Yes ([Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-v3-deployment-on-base/13177/9?u=fig) & [Chaos Labs](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-deployment-on-base/13708/6?u=fig))\n* Infrastructure/technical evaluation report by BGD Labs: Yes ([BGD Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-base-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/14133))\n* Oracle recommendation: Yes ([Chainlink Docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base) & [Announcement](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/03/chainlink-price-feeds-go-live-on-base-coinbases-layer-2-testnet/))\n* The graph support: Yes\n* Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance: Yes\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThe information provided above about Base is from public sources and Flipside Crypto cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.\n\nFor full disclosure, Coinbase partnered with Flipside Crypto upon the announcement of the network to make Base on-chain data available for free, for analysts.\n\nCoinbase has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and we are doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.\n\nThis ARFC has solely been prepared for technical evaluation and further community feedback.\n\n## **Next Steps:**\n\n1. Integrate BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and updated risk service provider recommendations.\n3. Submit the ARFC for a Snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 Base (upon Mainnet launch)\n\n## **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

For more details about MAI, please refer to [Qidao's official website](https://www.mai.finance/).\n\n# Motivation\n\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform. The risk parameters provided are the same as those adopted on the Polygon PoS Aave V3 Pool.\n\nThe newly proposed risk parameters replicating the MAI parameters on Polygon V3 pool are merely suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI is inviting Risk Service Providers to provide feedback on them.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: MAI\nContract Address: 0x3f56e0c36d275367b8c502090edf38289b3dea0d\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES (in isolation mode)|\n|Loan To Value|75%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|80%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.5%|\n|Reserve Factor| 20%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,000k|\n|Supply Cap|1,200k|\n|Debt Ceiling|2,000k|\n|Base|0%|\n|Slope1|4%|\n|Uoptimal|80%|\n|Slope2|75%|\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not affiliated with Qidao or any other entity and has not received payment to present this ARFC.\n\nAt the time of writing, the author (@marczeller) owns QI & vQI, the native asset of the Qidao Protocol, for ~50k$. The author was not paid to publish this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to onboard MAI on the Arbitrum Aave V3 pool.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "This proposal seeks to deploy Aave V3 on Polygon zkEVM L2 with a limited set of assets (WETH, USDC, WMATIC) to establish early strategic presence while maintaining conservative risk parameters. The timeline analytics show unanimous early and consistent support for YAE. Market impact is positive, indicating healthy adoption. Historical similar proposals for Aave V3 deployment on other L2s also passed with strong support and led to positive market responses, reinforcing confidence in this deployment. Forum discussions focused mainly on oracle infrastructure, highlighting a consensus to rely on Chainlink initially while acknowledging potential future experimentation with alternative oracles. Sentiment analysis reveals a mix of opinions, with positive support for the deployment but some caution expressed over oracle options. Overall, the community sentiment aligns well with the recommended YAE choice, supporting the strategic expansion while emphasizing safety and stability.",
