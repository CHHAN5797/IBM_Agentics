        "body": "Author: QiDao Protocol core team\nForum post: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-mai-on-aave-v3/7630\n\nProposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)\n\n### Summary\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.\n\nAll accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.\n\nThere’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\n* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCore team at QiDao Protocol.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.\n\nMAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.\n\nDespite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.\n\nMAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.\n\n3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\nBeing the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.\n\nMAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.\n\nMAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\n* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.\n* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance\n* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\n* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)\n* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap\n* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon\n* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM\n* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties\n* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nUsers can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users\nThere is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences\nThe multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.\nSince the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n* Market Cap: ~$250M\n* 24h Volume: >$40M\n* Volatility: Low\n* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose\n* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21\n\n9.

        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.\n\n# Motivation\n\nStaking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n[Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/jgf1/Stakewise)\n[Audits - Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)\n[Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n[Medium](https://stakewise.medium.com/)\n[Github Page\n](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts)[sETH2 contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a)\n[StakeWise dual tokenomics](https://stakewise.medium.com/the-tokenomics-of-staking-pools-what-are-staked-eth-tokens-and-how-do-they-work-2b4084515711)\n[StakeWise Metro Upgrade](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8)\n\nCommunities: [Discord](https://discord.gg/vM3a3csBDS) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n# Specifications\n\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nI (Jordan Sutcliffe) am the BizDev Lead at StakeWise, submitting the proposal on behalf of StakeWise DAO.\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\n->*StakeWise Overview*\n\nStakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.\n\nETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).\n\nAs a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.\n\nDmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).\n\nStakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).\n\n->*sETH2 Overview*\n\nsETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.\n\nsETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.\n\n**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.\n\nsETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.\n\nsETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nStakeWise’s background is detailed above.\n\nStakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\nInvestors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.\n\nThe StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nFirst and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.\n\nCreating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\n-> *Multi-sigs*\n\nStakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).\n\nThe DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.\n\n1.

The DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n**Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nMarket Cap ~$167M\n\nVolatility -\n\nsETH2 has proven peg stability. Superimposing stETH / ETH with sETH2 / ETH highlights this stability when compared against stETH which is already whitelisted for Aave.\n\n![|624x205](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV-tgDKkGvUmpr9MP6D9-qWNApCsLGrTiBqlIGL3K4IfXl2MB--glv35OerGGzZteAOZaAtbKVkCsGhGUuzgxD4JWBDpv76zk0QkfRaEMpIGAuuOuo1Ot6Ey8GF6qRC6c3JHTA60)\n\nNote that StakeWise will soon be adjusting the main UniSwap pool by reducing the fee tier from 0.3% to 0.01%, which is expected to close the remaining gap between sETH2 and ETH. StakeWise is also in the process of launching a new pool on Curve which will further increase sETH2’s peg resilience.\n\n**Volumes and DEXs**\n\n-> [UniSwap V3 Pool (sETH2/ETH)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)\n\nLiquidity: $160M\n\nVolume (24h): ~$350k on avg.\n\n-> [Curve Pool (sETH2/stETH)](https://curve.fi/factory/105)\n\nThis pool is in the final stages of being set up, with the addition of a liquidity gauge ([gauge proposal](https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/165)) passing recently and at least 5k ETH of seed liquidity to be added ([proposal here](https://snapshot.fei.money/#/proposal/0xa4115f24e824b09109991e1e369ba48c60921f503fe3efa4b39d4612eeb51533)).\n\n-> StakeWise is in discussions with multiple other protocols to create further liquidity pools with a diverse range of assets.

Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.\n\n4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).\n\nAs previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.\n\n-> *Staking risks*\n\nsETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:\n\n* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.\n* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.\n* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).\n\nNote that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.\n\nStakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.\n\n-> *Smart Contract Risks*\n\nStakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).\n\nDespite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.\n\n-> *Price Oracles*\n\nsETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.\n\n# Proposed Risk Parameters\n\n* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)\n* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)\n\nThe proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.\n\n### Interest Rate Model:\n\nUOptimal: 50%\nBase: 0%\nSlope 1: 8%\nSlope 2: 200%\n\n",

Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.\n\n# Motivations\nLaunched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):\n\nTotal trading volume: $160B\nTotal swaps: 5.91M\nTotal users: 1.25M\n\n1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.\n\nThe mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.\n\nIn December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.\n\n# Benefits to Aave Community\n\n1INCH is highly liquid.\n1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.\n1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.\n\n# Resources\nWebsite: 1inch.io\nToken: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302 4\nGovernance Forum\nDiscord Chat\nGithub\nDocumentation\nBlog\nTwitter\nCoingecko\nDune analytics\n\n# Specification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\nRoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.\n\n1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.\n\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.\n\nOn the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\n1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.\n\n1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.\n\n1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.\n\nP2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.\n1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.\n\nSupported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.\n\n# How is the asset currently used?\n\n1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3\n\n#Emission schedule\n\nThe 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.\n\nOf the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).\n\nUncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).\n\n# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nThe smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.\n\nThe 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.\n\n# Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $548M circulating, $1.98B FDV\n24h Volume: $50M\nExchanges: CoinGecko | CoinMarketCap\nDEX:\nUniswap V3 1 | $9.9M TVL | $176k 24h Trading Volume\n1inch Liquidity Protocol | $3.4M TVL\nUniswap V2 | $0.5M TVL\n\n# Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nTwitter 2: 1.0M\nDiscord: 15.8k\nTelegram [EN]: 25.9k\nReddit: 7.9k\nGithub\n\n# Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment (Token): Dec-23-2020\nNumber of Transactions: 580k+\nNumber of Holders: 87k\n\n# Risk Factors\n# 1INCH - Risk Assessment\n\n## Smart Contract Risk Counterparty Risk Market Risk Overall Risk\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-04 at 19.47.49.png](ipfs://bafkreie6zbinxzt2fufyo76ha7tb7mbbjwir2mgougsnbgqjg2x7ymiobm)\n    \n\n## General\n\nThe 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.\n\n* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.\n* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.\n* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.\n  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.\n  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.\n  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.\n\nThe 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nDAO Treasury: 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07\n1inch Foundation: 0x5E89f8d81C74E311458277EA1Be3d3247c7cd7D1\n1INCH: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302\nst1INCH: 0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba\nv1INCH: 0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2\nChainlink Oracle: 0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8\n\n## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:\n\nThe 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020.

        "author": "0xc31249BA48763dF46388BA5C4E7565d62ed4801C",
        "body": "**Author**: Jarvis Network Core Team\n**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)\n\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.\n\n# About Jarvis Network\nSynthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.\n\njFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.\n\nThe protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.\n\nWe have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).\n\nCombined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).\n\nWe also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.\n\njEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.\n\nWe debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.\n\nThe protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:\n\n- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).\n- $78M of volume on our primary market.\n- 33k swaps by 9k users.\n- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).\n- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).\n- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.\n- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.\n\n# Benefits for Aave V3\n### Fiat on and off-ramp\njEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.\n\nWe have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).\n\nHaving jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.\n\n### Large addressable market\nA part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).\n\n### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins\njEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.\n\n### DDM\njEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.\n\n### Low risk collateral\nAs collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.\n\njEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.\n\njEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.\n\n\n# Risk Parameters\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:\n\n1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.\n\n# Security specification and risks\n\n### Risks inherent to jEUR\nBesides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.\n\njEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.\n\n\n[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)\n\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.\njEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.\n\nThere is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.\n\nIt does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.\n\n### Audits\nWe have had two different audits by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and [Ubik](https://ubikgroup.co/): [Read the audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/security)\n\n# Data\n\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap: €3.5M circulating ($4M)\n- 24h Volume: $2M on our primary market, $400k on secondary markets\n- Volatility: Low\n- Maturity: Early\n\n### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n- Discord: 3k members\n- Twitter: 16.1k followers\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: Sep 2021 (Polygon)\n- Number of Transactions: 116k transactions including 30k swaps on our primary market and 22k on secondary markets.\n- Number of holders for token: 3,242 (more holders possible due to farming programs)\n\n# Links\n- Website: [https://jarvis.network](https://jarvis.network)\n- Dune: [Jarvis Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/0xroll/JarvisNetwork)\n- Docs: [https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network)\n- Code: [https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network)\n\n# Voting options\n- YES, add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n- NO, do not add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n",

CVX is the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCVX is not currently listed on major lending markets, including CVX on the platform would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage. This has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earn asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around $578.04k at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance. Further details can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n##  Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nLlama Community has presented a proposal to deposit Aave community funds into Curve and Convex Finance. Listing CVX on Aave enables Aave to earn aCVX tokens which can then be used to support the treasury management proposal detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?**\n\nConvex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted $CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV.. Adding support for $CVX will in turn provide future opportunities as Convex will also support other protocols in time. ie: FXS\n\nCVX is the governance token of the Convex protocol. By locking $CRV for life on Convex, each user gives his veCRV voting power to vlCVX holders (CVX lockers). Every vlCVX holders can vote on Convex governance proposals but also Curve governance proposals and gauges weights (5.05 veCRV/vlCVX). In the future, each vlCVX holders will control voting power on other tokens like FXS (users already can lock for life FXS for cvxFXS but vlCVX holders cannot vote on Frax governance proposals and gauges weights).\n\n**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nCVX would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem. Adding CVX creates another use case outside of the Convex tokenomics model. Llama expects the CVX demand to be similar to CRV. Additionally:\n\n* Significant Borrow Demand: Users can borrow CVX and then either stake or lock the CVX token to earn yield. In addition to direct yield, investors may borrow CVX to lock and then influence how the inflation schedule of CRV and CVX is distributed. CRV has one of the highest utilisations and dollar value borrowed of all high volatility assets listed on Aave V2.\n* CVX holders can deposit (lend) CVX and then borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).\n\nLlama Community intends to use the aCVX revenue generated to support Treasury Management activities. In this instance, aCVX could be redeemed and locked on Convex to then influence how the CRV and CVX inflation schedule is distributed. Llama Community intends to use the CVX to support growing the Aave and sAave Curve liquidity pools.\n\nThere is $43.2M TVL on the sAAVE pool and $11.8M TVL on the AAVE pool on Convex.\n\nThe Convex community is looking forward to lending and borrowing CVX on Aave. The community will enjoy extra revenues from the reserve factor.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nConvex, as DeFi farmers themselves, the team needed a platform that allowed users to receive the max boost possible from CRV in a simplified manner and allow users to collect their actual rewards directly without auto-selling. They also believe CRV stakers should be rewarded more as they are effectively, mining together with Liquidity Providers. They intend to change that with Convex by charging a lower performance fee, returning fees back to the CRV stakers and CVX token holders, and distributing rewards directly.\n\nThe concept of Convex was published to the public on April 15, 2021 with the protocol launching on May 17, 2021.\n\n30th April 2021 - [Convex platform was whitelisted on the Curve platform](https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-57-whitelist-the-convex-protocol/1654%20and%20Vote%20results:%20https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/44)\n17th May 2022 - [Convex was released](https://convexfinance.medium.com/ready-set-go-69bd68019c5a)\n7th September 2021 - [CVX vote locking went live](https://convexfinance.medium.com/september-update-vote-locking-launch-liquidity-provider-incentives-and-more-1380f406f725)\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**\n\nThe CVX token governs over 559M$ worth of CRV locked in the protocol (and $4M worth of CVX in the Convex treasury multisig). CVX is currently only available on 2 Fuse pools, however there is no liquidity there.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThe emission schedule can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/tokenomics).\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nConvex multisig can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/multisig-admin-rights).\n\n**8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\n* Market capitalisation: $1.35B\n* Average daily volume on the 30 last days: $25,918,420.66\n* CVX is listed on many exchanges, the largest being Gate.io, Sushiswap, Uniswap and Binance Source: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance#markets](http://www.coingecko.com)\n* veCRV controlled /vlCVX: 5.05 veCRV/vlCVX\n\n**9.
