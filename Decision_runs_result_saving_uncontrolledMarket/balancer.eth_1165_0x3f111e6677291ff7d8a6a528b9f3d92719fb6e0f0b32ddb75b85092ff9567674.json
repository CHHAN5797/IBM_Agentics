This pool will serve as the primary liquidity venue for lpETH, Loop’s yield-bearing ETH derivative.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n> \n> - Website: https://loopfi.xyz\n> - Documentation: https://docs.loopfi.xyz\n> - Github Page: https://github.com/orgs/LoopFi\n> \n> - Token Pair: lpETH / wETH\n> - Gauge Address: 0xb7bb16b58b04fe4f8d270430ce57d2a4753993de\n> - Pool Address: 0xdcb5ed405a9b11250def047ae8016008fae7d69b\n> - Deployment Chain: Ethereum Mainnet\n> - Relative Weight Cap: 2%\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Loop Finance is a specialized lending protocol designed to optimize leverage strategies for DEX LP tokens, with an initial focus on Pendle LP tokens. A key protocol innovation is  lpETH, a yield-bearing ETH receipt token that captures revenue from Loop's lending activities and is collateralized by a diversified index of LRTs. \n\nWhen users deposit ETH into Loop, they receive lpETH which can be:\n> \n> 1. Staked to earn lending yields\n> 2. Locked in dLP (Loop's governance token based on Balancers ve80/20 model) \n> 3. Provided as liquidity in AMM pools\n> \n> The lpETH token is designed to always be backed 1:1 with ETH, while growing the Net Asset Value (NAV) through various protocol mechanisms including:\n> \n> - Compounding revenue distribution from lending activities\n> - Arbitrage opportunities between direct minting/redemption and AMM trades\n> - Collateralisation by a diversified basket of high yielding LRT restaking strategies\n> - Swap Fees\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Establishing a gauge for this pool will catalyse deep, stable liquidity for lpETH-WETH which serves multiple purposes:\n> \n> 1. **Capital Efficiency**: Enables seamless entry/exit for ETH lenders with low slippage\n> 2. **Price Stability**: Helps maintain lpETH's peg through arbitrage\n> 3. **Yield Enhancement**: Provides additional revenue for lpETH holders through swap fees\n> 4. **Protocol Growth**: Facilitates broader adoption of Loop's lending markets\n> 5. **Benefit Balancer Treasury**: A portion of the pool fees will be directed to the Balancer treasury, in line with protocol revenue-sharing standards.\n> 6. **Strategic veBAL Accumulation:**\n> Loop is committed to becoming a significant veBAL holder to align long-term incentives with the Balancer ecosystem. Our protocol plans to integrate Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs) as supported collateral, creating a synergistic relationship where veBAL voting rights will be used to direct liquidity incentives toward these integrated pools. This strategy serves multiple purposes:\n>     1. Ensures sustainable liquidity for lpETH-WETH and future Loop-related pools\n>     2. Creates additional yield opportunities for Loop users through BPT collateralization\n>     3. Demonstrates long-term commitment to the Balancer ecosystem\n>     4. Enables collaborative governance participation in both protocols\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> Governance:\n> \n> \n> Loop operates under a dual governance structure:\n> \n> - Technical Administration: 2/3 Multisig (addresses to be provided)\n> - Protocol Parameters: dLP token holder voting\n> - Admin capabilities include:\n>     - Emergency pause functionality\n>     - Collateral parameter adjustments\n>     - Fee distribution updates\n> - Timelock: 24 hours for parameter changes, no system upgrades possible\n> - Future plans include transitioning to full DAO governance with TGE of LOOP by Q1 2025\n> \n> Oracles:\n> \n> - Primary price feeds: Chainlink ETH/USD\n> - Secondary price feeds: Time-weighted Balancer pool prices\n> - Collateral pricing: Combination of constituent asset oracles and pool pricing\n> - Failsafe: Circuit breakers on extreme price movements\n> \n> Audits: (https://docs.loopfi.xyz/extras/security) \n> \n> - Audit 1: Watchpug completed\n> - Audit 2: Code4rena completed\n> - There is an ongoing bug bounty for $100,000 on [code4rena](https://code4rena.com/bounties/loopfi#top)\n> \n> Centralisation Vectors: \n> No centralisation vectors\n> \n> Market History:\n> \n> Protocol information and market history can be found here on the Loop Dune dashboard: \n> https://dune.com/rangonomics/loopfi\n> \n> Value:\n> \n> The lpETH-WETH pool will serve as the primary liquidity venue for lpETH with several value drivers:\n> \n> - **Strategic Value**:\n>     - Essential infrastructure for Loop's lending markets\n>     - Complementary to Balancer's existing ETH-based pools\n>     - Potential integration with other Balancer pools through composability\n>     - With TGE of the LOOP token, Loop will introduce dLP tokenomics which means that locked LOOP tokens will be sent to Balancer similar to Radiant Capital.\n> - **Growth Potential**:\n>     - Targeted TVL growth to $20 million within 6 months\n>     - Integration with major lending protocols planned\n>     - Super-chain expansion roadmap (Scroll, Optimism)\n\n**Request for Support & Contact**\nWe welcome feedback from the Balancer community to strengthen this proposal. Our core team is available for discussion through the forum or via Discord. \n\nWe value the community's guidance and look forward to collaborative moving this proposal forward in a manner to best serves both ecosystems.\n\n#### Specification\n\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function two times with the following arguments:\n>\n>\n>\n> 1st addGauge function call\n> gauge(address): `0xb7bb16b58b04fe4f8d270430ce57d2a4753993de`\n> gaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/dinero-protocol/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n>\n>In addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Dinero Protocol, there are additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n>\n>pxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero Protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n>\n>The governance token for pxETH is DINERO.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Dinero has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Dinero’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the primary venue for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n>\n>An LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Dinero plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nDinero’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://gov.dinero.xyz/). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://github.com/dinero-protocol/audits/tree/master).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/gtWETHe has just been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged.\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Dinero plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n### Technical Specifications:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x3a51bdf9013633Ae934a3630db96f09aE4c5814a`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRedacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nRedacted’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/redactedcartel.eth). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://dineroismoney.com/docs/security).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/ETH pool has not yet been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged. Since launch on 2023/12/13, the main liquidity for pxETH is on Maverick (in anticipation of a gauge on Balancer).\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xdee29b7b6dF3576280bFBbC088ee9eBAA767C0Bd`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/519\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base.

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n* The pool shall has a swap fee of 4 basis points, i.e., 0.04% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n# References/Useful links\n\n* [Slidedeck on E-CLPs ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n* [Website ](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github ](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> pxETH is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol. pxETH is built on top of the Redacted DAO’s Pirex platform and forms an integral part of Redacted’s Dinero protocol, a protocol which aims to vertically integrate ETH staking, block proposal and building, a RPC, leverage, and yield stripping into one synergistic ecosystem comprising pxETH, the Redacted Relayer RPC, and the DINERO stablecoin. pxETH provides users with a liquid and fungible tokenized staked ETH which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here ](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Redacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\nBy using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\n* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\nSeveral E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: [https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps) 1\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n## Oracles\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n## Audits\n\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n## Centralization vectors\n\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n## Market History\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains.
