E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **GYD is an all-weather stablecoin that provides one-stop access to stablecoin risk control.** GYD is fully backed by a set of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level to automate diversification and redundancy.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.\n\n> # References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n> # Protocol description\n> \n> * GYD is an all-weather stablecoin that provides one-stop access to stablecoin risk control.

This hub-and-spoke network will enable a liquid secondary market for GYD to make it easier to exit from/ enter into GYD.\n> \n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n> \n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins.

AG](https://www.bankfrick.li/en)) to authorized individuals/companies (KYC/KYB).\n\n* The KUMA Protocol is a decentralized entity governed by vMIMO token holders that leverages these NFTs and issues KUMA interest-bearing tokens (KIBTs), which are freely transferable erc-20 tokens. These interest-bearing tokens behave similarly to stablecoins whose balance increases automatically.\n\nCurrently, 3 KIBTs are deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Mantle & Linea:\n\n* FRK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 357 days French T-Bills. (± 3,35% APR)\n* USK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFTs, themselves backed by US 12 months T-Bills. (± 4,5% APR)\n* EGK, a KUMA Interest-bearing token backed by KUMA NFT, themselves backed by 740 days Next.e.GO Mobile SE Corporate Bonds. (± 8,75% APR)\n\n### Parallel Protocol\n\nThe Parallel Protocol (prev. Mimo Protocol) is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol deployed on Ethereum, Polygon PoS and Fantom. Stablecoins (PAR & paUSD) are decentralized (controlled by vMIMO holders), non-custodial, overcollateralized, and fully redeemable synthetic asset pegged to the Euro/USD fiat currency.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nThe role of the e-cs-kp-usd pool is to increase the stability of paUSD and wUSK (1), the on-chain liquidity of both paUSD and wUSK (2), connect the Parallel and KUMA ecosystems (3) and providing a fiat gateway to paUSD & wUSK holders on Ethereum (4). Together, these 4 points allow for building a Bonds DeFi ecosystem.\n\n1. paUSD & wUSK peg:\n\n* paUSD is issued following the CDP model; if paUSD trades below its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to buy paUSD cheaper and repay their debt; if paUSD trades above its peg, CDP owner are incentivised to borrow paUSD and sell them at a higher price; since wUSK can be exchanged for Bonds NFT, and can be sold for real USD, arbitrages can be performed between the Balancer pool and USD market to help maintain the paUSD peg; so if paUSD trades below or above its peg, anyone can perform an arbitrage without having to go through a CDP.\n* wUSK is an erc-4626 wrapper of USK. USK is issued by using the “swap” function on the KUMA Protocol, each USK are backed by Treasury Bonds NFT, if the peg is below the real price, KYC/KYB people are incentivized to buy USK and redeem the NFT, if the price is above the peg, NFT holders are incentivized to mint USK and sell them.\n\n2. On-chain liquidity:\nSince paUSD can be exchanged for USDC and wUSK which are redeemable for USD. Users can swap paUSD for wUSK and/or USDC then USD by buying/selling KUMA NFTs and/or redeem USDC for USD to access the latter’s liquidity or vice versa.\n3. Connect ecosystems:\nThe wUSK/paUSD/USDC pool connects Parallel and its paUSD (essentially a way to borrow USD with various collateral) to KUMA and its wUSK (providing onchain US T-bills), enabling multiple use cases.\n\n* DeFi on-ramp and off-ramp: USK has a direct fiat on and off-ramp by buying/selling underlying KUMA NFTs.\n* It would also connect paUSD holders to the KUMA Bonds NFTs ecosystems.\n\n### A few notes:\n\n* PAR (the Parallel EURO stablecoin) already have a gauge on Balancer Polygon: [2eur (PAR)](https://app.balancer.fi/#/polygon/pool/0x513cdee00251f39de280d9e5f771a6eafebcc88e000000000000000000000a6b)\n* Mimo Labs has started building [positions](https://debank.com/profile/0x4a266739E40664e80470CC335120a2A1fA0B3F3f) in AURA (±175k $vlAURA) & BAL and the Parallel Protocol [treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b) currently holds 21k $vlAURA.\n* Mimo Labs is buying ±$25k AURA per month which are locked to incentivize the liquidity.\n* The Parallel DAO will also pay ±$1.5k voting incentives per week using the Paladin Quest vote marketplace to the pool (more details [here](https://gov.mimo.capital/t/mgp-14-adjust-mimo-tokens-incentives-repartition-on-ethereum-polygon-pos/292))\n\n# Specifications:\n\n1. Governance:\n\n* Parallel Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mimo.eth)) and decisions are executed through a ⅝ multi-sig (4 team members and 4 dao members [elected](https://docs.mimo.capital/parallel-protocol/governance/dao-multisig) by vMIMO holders).\n  * Polygon PoS: 0x2046c0416A558C40cb112E5ebB0Ca764c3C5c32a\n  * Ethereum: 0x25Fc7ffa8f9da3582a36633d04804F0004706F9b\n  * Fantom: 0x174162ddecE9d0b7B68fd945e38c3372C4C818ba\n* KUMA Protocol: none on-chain governance (vote via [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/kumaprotocol.eth)) and decisions are executed through a 4/7 multi-sig (currently held by 7 team members, but a proposal to elect DAO members will take place later).\n  * Ethereum: 0xB5502747AABDCa21E832951b4caaF739dA33f450\n  * Polygon PoS: 0x1A1A402746FBe8bcFE0f7992AE27c4eD81A70156\n  * Linea: 0x1151d63eB6154843D4b4898cF4C63aF556642997\n  * Mantle: 0x37D1C94087643dFE5288F72cD1e4A6fde5b130A9\n\n2.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/915\n\n**Summary:**\n> * This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for WETH/wstETH on Polygon zkEVM.\n> * The underlying pool is an Elliptic Concentrated Liquidity Pool (E-CLP). E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IAVN7mDiPt4teeuBUMqi0KJdZ2aiRWwGAxRhJU75TB4/edit?usp=sharing)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> * Lido’s wrapped stETH (wstETH) is stETH which is deposited into the stETH wrapper to create a new token called wstETH. stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * WETH is an ERC-20 version of ETH. - [WETH](https://weth.io/)\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n>\n> * Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n>\n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. A similar E-CLP to the one mentioned in this proposal has been recently deployed on Arbitrum. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n**Governance:**\n> The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n**Oracles:**\n> * rateProvider0 (for WETH): 0x00\n> * rateProvider1 (for wstETH): [0x8dd590Ebb702C21A41289A0a69B0C6F74BdeCE75](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x8dd590Ebb702C21A41289A0a69B0C6F74BdeCE75)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n**Audits:**\n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed [here](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/audit-reports) (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n**Centralization vectors:**\n> No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n**Market History:** \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n \n**Value:** As per “Motivation”. \n\n**Contracts**\n> * WETH/wstETH E-CLP: [0xe58cD0C79CDff6252476b3445BEE1400503e0aE0](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0xe58cd0c79cdff6252476b3445bee1400503e0ae0)\n> * Childchain gauge on Polygon zkEVM: [0x8dd928a3Aa0274bBA3b42DD9F41756AaF1e78b2f](https://zkevm.polygonscan.com/address/0x8dd928a3Aa0274bBA3b42DD9F41756AaF1e78b2f)\n> * Polygon zkEVM root gauge on Ethereum: [0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F)\n\n**Technical specification**\n> The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n> gauge(address): `0xf21F8CC39f5858cb2eAF5654a863C9b034AE451F` \n> gaugeType(string): `PolygonZkEvm`",

The sFRAX token represents pro rata deposits within the vault and is always withdrawable for FRAX stablecoins at the pro rata rate at all times.  - [Frax](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n> * Frax Finance is a decentralized lending platform which issues the FRAX stablecoin. Frax Finance algorithmically sustains the value of FRAX through the use of fractional collateral reserves. The collateral used on Frax Finance is split between an accepted collateral (e.g. ether) and Frax Finance’s governance token, FXS. The collateralization ratio for FRAX changes based on its price. - [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/pt-BR/prices/Frax?timestamp=1705682853673)\n\n> # Motivation\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n>\n>\n>\n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles**: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n>\n>\n>\n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins.
