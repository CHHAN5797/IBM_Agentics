The previous Supply Cap increase from 17.2M to 29.3M is filling rapidly. This publication seeks to increase the Supply Cap in effort to enable MaticX deposit growth to continue. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nWith Liquidity Mining (LM) ongoing, MaticX deposit rewards (SD) and wMATIC borrowing rewards (stMATIC & MaticX), it is important that Aave DAO ensures there is adequate capacity to enable the many yield maximising products built on Aave v3 to grow. \n\nWith an abundance of wMATIC deposits and LM ongoing, we are experiencing exception MaticX deposit growth. \n\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.19.48.png](ipfs://bafkreihzi2cmpwhakz3wx2c63vtmxrhnliqfndk2ufnhwjpmbtlboyceje)\n    \n\nTo facilitate the continued growth of MaticX, this proposal seeks to increase the Supply Cap to 75% of supply on Polygon. This is the maximum counterparty risk Aave DAO has voted to support.\n\nCurrent MaticX supply on Polygon is [50,559,800 units](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6). Therefore the newly proposed Supply Cap is 38,000,000 units (rounded up). The author expects a whale to be moving liquidity from Ethereum to Polygon, if this was to occur in the next day or so, then the proposed Supply Cap will be raised, with support from one risk service provider.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) the preferred path forward is to implement several upgrades to gradually increase Aave's MaticX exposure over time. \n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: MaticX\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0xfa68FB4628DFF1028CFEc22b4162FCcd0d45efb6`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6)\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|29.3M units|38.0M units|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This publication proposes increasing the Supply Caps to enable greater deposits into Aave Optimism v3.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs supply of wstETH on Optimism and deposits in Aave v3 continue to grow, the Supply Cap requires continual updates to reflect market conditions.\n\nCurrent utilisation is 91.75%, with a cap of 12,000 units and a wstETH supply of [35,574.52](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb) units on Optimism. \n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.27.33.png](ipfs://bafkreihwop2t6s6f56fk2uotrsk6s6szrzq5435mcpytjxqkngtdpwlqvq)\n    \nPredominately, most large wstETH collateral holdings are being used to borrow wETH. However, there are a few large addresses borrowing stable coins. Using Chaos Lab's [Risk Explorer](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/ccar/risk-explorer), assuming the price of wstETH drops by 20%, there is $0 bad debt incurred to Aave Protocol. \n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.27.56.png](ipfs://bafkreibe3cs4p7kywnasrzsf3yzax7vnvc5stjfs5hzcuymhdyp5l3w4ba)\n    \nThe largest wstETH collateral and stable coin debt users have resonably conservative health factor ratings. Some are also using multiple assets as collateral and are passively holdings funds that could be deposited into Aave Protocol as collateral.  \n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-28 at 19.28.16.png](ipfs://bafkreichtf3i74ha6odpwieuxnkq5joodajcjcktxd62y5lcyhtdpss3om)\n    \nIf such positions were liquidated the wstETH>>wETH>>USDC routing is most effective assuming liquidators are reverting back to an initial stable coin holding. \n\nThere are 5 wallets holding more than 510 aoptwstETH. However, when viewed in agggregate the larger wallets with stable coin debt have helath factors around 1.45-1.50. Current liquidity exceeds that required to liquidate the largest positions. \n\nDue to the favourable liquidity coniditions, how users are interacting with Aave Protocol, this publication seeks to increase the Supply Cap by 75%. This represents 59.03% of wstETH supply on Optimism.\n\nWhen LST Supply Caps have been raised on other networks, they have been filled quickly. This highlights the need for larger Supply Cap increases to reduce governance overhead, but also to support communities building on Aave. When Supply Caps are reached, products built on top of Aave are adversley affected. \n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave's exposure to wMATIC over time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters have been proposed by Llama.\n\nTicker: wstETH\n\nContract: [optimism:`0x1F32b1c2345538c0c6f582fCB022739c4A194Ebb`](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb)\n\nChaos Labs Supports the following:\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|12,000 units|21,000 units|\n\nGauntlet supports the following:\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|12,000 units|18,000 units|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nThe below details various proposals reflecting Llama's efforts to date:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n* [ARFC MaticX Polygon v3 Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555)\n* [ARFC MaticX SupplyCap Increase Polygon v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-supplycap-increase-polygon-v3/12217/12)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nThe below chart shows the growth of MaticX supply on both Ethereum and Polygon. The recent spike in Polygon circulating supply is the result of the previous Supply Cap discussion on Aave v3 governance forum and the resulting outreach to various whales. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HzidlG1.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7KgR8XR.png)\n\nThe chart shows a clear growth since 16th February when SD rewards were initiated. There is a clear link between SD emissions on Aave v3 and MaticX growth.\n\nUsing the [Chaos Labs Updated Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-updated-supply-and-borrow-cap-methodology/11602) the MaticX Supply Cap can be increased from 17.2M units to 34.4M units. Doubling of the Supply Cap is acheived by overlooking the limitations of circulating supply and focusing on liquidity which follows the rational of the previous Supply Cap adjustment. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xW01WDf.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iMHRNbO.png)\nRatio exceeds 2.0 and thus, maximum increase in the Supply Cap is 100%.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave's exposure to MaticX over time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters have been proposed by Llama for the community to review and discuss in the comments section.\n\nTicker: MaticX\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0xfa68FB4628DFF1028CFEc22b4162FCcd0d45efb6`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6)\n\nOption 1 - 19.6M Supply Cap\nOption 2 - 29.3M Supply Cap\nOption 3 - NAE\nOption 4 - ABSTAIN\n\nOption 1 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\nOption 2 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\n\nPlease do read over the comments on the governance forum and review the vote linked [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) before casting a vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Enabling borrowing with a reasonable BorrowCap and the introduction of borrowing rewards, will lead to significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. \n\nThis proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards are expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below proposals details are applicable:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nIn support of the upcoming liquidity rewards distribution, this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap, enable borrowing and introduce a BorrowCap sufficient to create a notable deposit yield.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GSWOAxP.png)\n\nDetailed analysis can be found on the governance forum, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters are being proposed and have been reviewed by [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555/6).\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Loan To Value|58.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|67.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|SupplyCap|8.6M units|\n|Borrowing|Enabled|\n|BorrowingCap|5.2M|\n\nThe following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Slope1|4.00%|\n|Slope2|150.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |0.50%|\n|Stable Slope2 |150.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |2.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00%|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

With Chainlink expected to monetise oracles, v2 partially frozen and three communities actively distributing rewards on v3, this publication seeks to further encourage the migration of users from v2 to v3.\n\nWith a successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot vote, this publication has incorporated community feedback and presents three options for the community to select from. The key consideration is the upside realized by acting early during the liquidity mining campaign.\n\nThis publication parameter changes supportive of encouraging the migration of funds without putting any users' positions at risk of liquidation.\n\n# Motivation\n\nCurrently, there are three communities distributing four tokens across Polygon v3.\n\n* SD - Stader Labs\n* LDO - Lido DAO\n* MaticX & stMATIC - Polygon Foundation\n\n![|717x331](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3KeyUDurlDkL7kstA4FJOOrJfiPp_-yIJ-_bWZfJdaUMBbR000jzA_sqKMd3-VKSQYGGtXbvl19r2N7tv76wV5qRQxdTu8nH89etXt6y_YIGxWyjU-aabCwDNENicIXSsokR5WGAQvIMAYJ-CFQvIiA)\n\nThis has led to Polygon v3 offering better deposit rates relative to v2. The charts below show the TVL for Polygon v3 since genesis, v3 for 2023 and v2 for 2023. During 2023 TVL in v3 is steadily increasing, the v2 markets TVL is more trending sideways with asset prices broadly trending sideways/higher.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zSVde23.png)\n\nLiquidity Mining (LM) on v3 is helping to pull users across and the migration tool from BGD further supports this initiative. At TokenLogic, we believe more can be done to migrate users and it is better to do this whilst LM is ongoing. This publication at its core seeks to accelerate the migration of users from v2 to v3 whilst LM is ongoing.\n\nThe [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x478169c0840488588b31d7e23b889b5f9442057db9c7a5b9b6cfdd61fe7108ff) received strong support from the community with 525k votes, 92.42%, in favor of implementing the change. This publication incorporated feedback from the comments on the previous governance forum post and now includes two additional reduced impact options for the community to consider.\n\nIncorporating feedback from the community, TokenLogic is presenting three options to the community for consideration. Options 1) and 2) include adjusting the Uoptimal and Reserve Factor (RF) parameters where as Option 3 includes only adjusting the RF parameter:\n\n* Option 1 - Adjust Uoptimal & RF Aggressive\n  * Reduce Uoptimal by 50.00% the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal value\n  * Increase RF such that deposit yield remains the same\n  * Maintain the same Slope2 gradient\n* Option 2 - Adjust Uoptimal & RF Conservative\n  * Reduce Uoptimal by 33.33% the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal value\n  * Increase RF such that deposit yield remains the same\n  * Maintain the same Slope2 gradient\n* Option 3 - Increase RF\n  * Increase RF such that deposit yield is reduced by 20%\n\nThe below table compares the outcome of Option 1, 2 and 3.\n\n![|717x219](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MAHb1zay_-dKkRpPc5Wu1axIHPQZt18ubCXJaPSSI8ILI1PJuB_BeKqKYGeyfVGp6dkKHEhzvFF2UzAjC5pjXf6GGha6TTVYLFQyMhcuRWRAkP0gR0rQ1gwlUP3KHZlEy71sQuof4AqKHmsb9KlrMko)\n\nImplementing any of the three options above will further encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3. Option 3 affects only deposit rates and thus increases the deposit rate differential between the markets as the borrowing rate remains unchanged on v2. Option 3 relies on depositors migrating liquidity, due to lower deposit rate, to increase the borrowing cost over time. Whereas Option 1 and 2 directly increase the borrowing cost for users whilst keeping deposit rates the same which encourages borrowers to migrate.\n\nOption 1 and 2 - leverage strategies and simply deposit to draw a loan users will experience higher borrowing rates. Structured leverage products will experience increased vol decay (deposit yield - borrowing yield - rebalancing/recentreing costs). Do note, the feasibility of structured 2x leverage products is more sensitive to LTV & LT changes, as reducing these parameters can break the strategy. Reducing the Uoptimal and increasing the RF means structured products remain viable, however, like all debt positions, there are higher holding costs over time. Option 3 impacts these products less as the collateral type is not normally stable coins and more likely to be high vol assets which typically have very low deposit rates.\n\nAn example of Option 3, deposit wMATIC borrow USDC and swap for wMATIC for 2x leverage is affected by changing the RF as the deposit rate on wMATIC falls. But as wMATIC deposit rate is already low, 0.73% relative to 3.29% on v3. Increasing the RF from 20% to 36%, reducing deposit rate from 0.73% to 0.58%, 0.15%, will have less impact as increasing the borrowing costs on USDC from 2.99% to 3.40%, 0.41% via Option 2.\n\n## Uoptimal\n\nUsing Option 1 as an example, the revised Uoptimal parameter is the midpoint between current utilization and Uoptimal values. Ie: If utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%, the midpoint between the existing utilization and Uoptimal value.\n\n## Slope 2\n\nBy reducing the Uoptimal parameter, the gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100% is lowered. In order to maintain the current gradient, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher. In the image below, Option 1, the Slope 2 parameter changes from 75% to 124% in response to the Uoptimal parameter being reduced from 80% to 60%. Notice how the red and blue lines are parallel during the second leg of the curve, this is because they have the same gradient.\n\n![|680x420](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8ieERUcmKnMq5zNhNHVN2CSRvkxuAM15EUvFack5dRtxc_3vFHEK4h5T0deFqjVSZj6c8ZeC8Ykvi5oVZBpj6PaBK0LhlvnM8bKCrit9UVt9OjsDDzk7I7M_g0QEAYzDhL4b2yKVqNdmk2S6TO42frw \"Chart\")\n\n## Reserve Factor\n\nAs a portion of the interest paid by borrowers is directed to users who provide liquidity, by increasing the borrow rate, the deposit rate also increases assuming the reserves utilization remains unchanged. To counter the higher deposit rate, which encourages more deposits, the RF is increased. This redirects interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors.\n\nDue to abnormally high USDT usage, 77.49% at the time of writing, this proposal suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs. The justification for this is to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, such that it encourages migration whilst avoiding reducing the Uoptimal such that borrowing cost increases substantially by shifting utilizing onto the more stepper portion of the yield curve. When utilization drops by a material amount, it would be prudent to reduce the Uoptiomal value in line with other stable coins.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe tables below detail the proposed parameter changes to achieve the outcome defined in the table above.\n\n![|717x219](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mdzqLwCzZfM2ws3svjTqRDSFdnss9BA9tBYURaFAaBcgZIfplNPNr1ztr8CRskyhhhAHOLtkkM9PbduUIuwBpqAViSnl481DtN3E0KoU2ij_i4rM-H3wj-jrJ9b3z9odgFzm1nYQALjMRopazvBU_SE)\n\n![|401x217](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wCVm6E9JA-0Um7aXIv-tPYdricROWU0XfPispV4pUNfOM4U41DsL2TNhve3Hwb4EKPI195EIp2MxvBMVtMzQG4vcpf5W3Z8_lqMlPyb0CtrR8rrY9QhHlBbbVQo7SDFUrve53e3PnKX3bZRjY5qzHQ4)\n\nPrior to any AIP submission the numbers should be updated in line with the strategy to avoid any un-favourable parameter configurations.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe author, TokenLogic, is only paid by Aave DAO via Butter as part of the [Incentivised Delegate Campaign](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). \n![Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 19.46.09.png](ipfs://bafkreiedatwzrimn6mukrp6cnli5egaxqcadwwyjaceiuppabusmfkdjuy)\n    ",
