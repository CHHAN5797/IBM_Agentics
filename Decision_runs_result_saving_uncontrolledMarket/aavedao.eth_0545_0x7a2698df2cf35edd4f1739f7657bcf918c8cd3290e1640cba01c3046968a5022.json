The authors propose a process by which interested parties publish an application to the Aave Forum (governance.aave.com 1), after a period of discussion and comment, an offchain vote is taken using Snapshot. Should that temperature check vote be successful, an on-chain vote targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor will formally add the address and its initial cap to the GHO system as a facilitator. This post outlines the process in detail, an addition includes 2 sample applications for each of the facilitators Aave Companies has released publicly, Aave V3 & Flash Minter.\n\n# Motivation\nThe GHO Stablecoin Protocol will be governed by the Aave DAO, specifically the Aave DAO Short Executor. There are 3 new processes that the Aave DAO will need to implement:\n- a process for facilitator onboarding\n- a process for adjustment of a facilitator limit\n- a process for facilitator offboarding.\n\nThis document only intends to address the first of these processes.\n\n# Implementation\nThe Facilitator onboarding process will begin with a post on the Aave Governance Forum (governance.aave.com 1) conforming to the template below. Next, a 7 day discussion period will commence for the community to ask questions. After the discussion period a snapshot temperature check can be posted on Snapshot. The standard snapshot process with an informal quorum of 320,000 votes is suggested to ensure sufficient community input is received and to keep consistency with existing governance processes. Should the temperature check be successful, another discussion period of 7 days will commence for the community to further refine the proposal. The authors hope that during this second period technical and risk contributors especially provide feedback on the proposed facilitator design, terms of the credit line and the initial GHO limit being requested. Following this second discussion period, an on-chain proposal targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor can then be posted via the Aave DAO Governance contracts to formally on-board the facilitator with its initial GHO limit.\n\n# Specification\nFOR - Adopt this process for onboarding GHO Facilitators\n\nNAE - Do not adopt this process for onboarding GHO Facilitators\n\nABSTAIN - Abstain\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n# Facilitator Application Template\n## Background\n- Title of Facilitator\n- High Level Description of Mechanism / Request\n- Author / Link to License\n- Link to whitepaper (if applicable)\n- How Facilitator Furthers GHO\n- Organization / DAO responsible for operation of the Facilitator (if applicable)\n- History, Details, Background of the operator of the Facilitator (if applicable)\n## Credit Line Details\n- Requested Facilitator Cap\n- Cap Increase Roadmap (if applicable)\n- Use of Funds\n- Revenue Streams\n- Revenue Split / Interest Terms\n- Collateral Posted\n- Other Commercial Details/Considerations\n## Mechanism & Risk Details\n- Detailed Description of the Facilitator\n- How Facilitator is backing GHO\n- If RWA - description of legal structure etc\n- Detail any / all risks (Oracle risk, Third-party Dependencies, Contract risk, Cross-chain, Bridging, Regulatory, etc) as well as any prevention/mitigation methods\n## Governance Controls\n- List of controls given to Aave DAO\n- Controls given not to Aave DAO\n- Alternative controls / roles that may be present but not set (optimistic governance?

        "body": "Author: QiDao Protocol core team\nForum post: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-mai-on-aave-v3/7630\n\nProposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)\n\n### Summary\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.\n\nAll accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.\n\nThere’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\n* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCore team at QiDao Protocol.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.\n\nMAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.\n\nDespite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.\n\nMAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.\n\n3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\nBeing the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.\n\nMAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.\n\nMAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\n* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.\n* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance\n* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\n* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)\n* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap\n* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon\n* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM\n* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties\n* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nUsers can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users\nThere is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences\nThe multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.\nSince the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n* Market Cap: ~$250M\n* 24h Volume: >$40M\n* Volatility: Low\n* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose\n* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21\n\n9.

        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.\n\n# Motivation\n\nStaking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n[Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/jgf1/Stakewise)\n[Audits - Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)\n[Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n[Medium](https://stakewise.medium.com/)\n[Github Page\n](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts)[sETH2 contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a)\n[StakeWise dual tokenomics](https://stakewise.medium.com/the-tokenomics-of-staking-pools-what-are-staked-eth-tokens-and-how-do-they-work-2b4084515711)\n[StakeWise Metro Upgrade](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8)\n\nCommunities: [Discord](https://discord.gg/vM3a3csBDS) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n# Specifications\n\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nI (Jordan Sutcliffe) am the BizDev Lead at StakeWise, submitting the proposal on behalf of StakeWise DAO.\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\n->*StakeWise Overview*\n\nStakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.\n\nETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).\n\nAs a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.\n\nDmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).\n\nStakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).\n\n->*sETH2 Overview*\n\nsETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.\n\nsETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.\n\n**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.\n\nsETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.\n\nsETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nStakeWise’s background is detailed above.\n\nStakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\nInvestors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.\n\nThe StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nFirst and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.\n\nCreating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\n-> *Multi-sigs*\n\nStakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).\n\nThe DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.\n\n1.

The DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n**Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nMarket Cap ~$167M\n\nVolatility -\n\nsETH2 has proven peg stability. Superimposing stETH / ETH with sETH2 / ETH highlights this stability when compared against stETH which is already whitelisted for Aave.\n\n![|624x205](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV-tgDKkGvUmpr9MP6D9-qWNApCsLGrTiBqlIGL3K4IfXl2MB--glv35OerGGzZteAOZaAtbKVkCsGhGUuzgxD4JWBDpv76zk0QkfRaEMpIGAuuOuo1Ot6Ey8GF6qRC6c3JHTA60)\n\nNote that StakeWise will soon be adjusting the main UniSwap pool by reducing the fee tier from 0.3% to 0.01%, which is expected to close the remaining gap between sETH2 and ETH. StakeWise is also in the process of launching a new pool on Curve which will further increase sETH2’s peg resilience.\n\n**Volumes and DEXs**\n\n-> [UniSwap V3 Pool (sETH2/ETH)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)\n\nLiquidity: $160M\n\nVolume (24h): ~$350k on avg.\n\n-> [Curve Pool (sETH2/stETH)](https://curve.fi/factory/105)\n\nThis pool is in the final stages of being set up, with the addition of a liquidity gauge ([gauge proposal](https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/165)) passing recently and at least 5k ETH of seed liquidity to be added ([proposal here](https://snapshot.fei.money/#/proposal/0xa4115f24e824b09109991e1e369ba48c60921f503fe3efa4b39d4612eeb51533)).\n\n-> StakeWise is in discussions with multiple other protocols to create further liquidity pools with a diverse range of assets.

Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.\n\n4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).\n\nAs previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.\n\n-> *Staking risks*\n\nsETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:\n\n* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.\n* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.\n* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).\n\nNote that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.\n\nStakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.\n\n-> *Smart Contract Risks*\n\nStakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).\n\nDespite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.\n\n-> *Price Oracles*\n\nsETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.\n\n# Proposed Risk Parameters\n\n* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)\n* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)\n\nThe proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.\n\n### Interest Rate Model:\n\nUOptimal: 50%\nBase: 0%\nSlope 1: 8%\nSlope 2: 200%\n\n",

New assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nSince Gauntlet began its partnership with the Aave protocol, we have received requests from the Community to analyze asset listings. Community members, developers, and other stakeholders often asked us questions like, \"how much liquidity should this asset have before being listed? What should the asset's initial parameters be? How do we protect the protocol from insolvency?\" \n\nGauntlet's framework focuses specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Aave. Our framework can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3). This will work in conjunction with [Aave's existing asset listing framework](https://docs.aave.com/governance/guides/new-asset-listing). \n\nListing assets is essential to the growth of the protocol. As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor, Aave must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol. Gauntlet will conduct these risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in.\n\nNotably, we recommend that LTV and Liquidation Threshold be set to 0% on the initial listing. In other words, assets will not be allowed to be used as collateral upon their initial listing. \n\nHistorically, the community has listed assets with non-zero LTV and Liquidation Threshold. Because there are risks in doing so, this Snapshot vote helps the community align on best practices moving forward.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCommunity input is valuable because requiring that assets are listed with an initial LTV of 0% imposes important trade-offs:\n\n1. Not requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can potentially allow the asset to have more utility (depending on the asset) from the onset of listing. Thus, the protocol may be earning revenue at the onset of the listing (driven by increased borrows). However, when assets are enabled as collateral from the initial listing, the protocol immediately faces the technical and market risks inherent in adding another risk vector to the protocol. The protocol is only as strong as its weakest link.\n2. Requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can protect the protocol from unforeseen mechanism, smart contract, and other technical risks. In addition, setting an initial LTV of 0% allows the protocol to observe how supply and borrow usage as well as liquidity conditions evolve following the asset listing. This data enables more robust risk analysis and fine-tuning of LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters following the initial asset listing. The tradeoff is that until an asset is enabled as collateral, usage may be limited (depending on the asset), and thus, the protocol faces an opportunity cost of revenue. We view this as a minuscule opportunity cost (e.g., a few weeks of revenue attributable to the asset) relative to the risks. Assets can be turned on as collateral, but being turned off as collateral is a more difficult process with increased user friction.\n\n\nOption 1 above should not be interpreted as suggesting that all assets should be enabled as collateral. It simply allows for the possibility that assets can be listed with an initial non-zero LTV should the community deem the asset a collateral asset.\n\nShould the community favor Option 2, assets should be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, and a separate proposal must be proposed by the community at some point after the initial listing to enable the asset as collateral. At that point in time, given strong community buy-in, Gauntlet will conduct market risk analysis to recommend LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n\n* This Snapshot vote has the below options:\n1. Not all assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.\n2. All assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%. After 2-3 weeks of operation as a non-collateral asset, the community can propose turning it on as collateral. At that point, Gauntlet will make parameter recommendations as per our Notion document below.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Quick Links\n[Gauntlet Asset Listing Framework for Market Risk](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3)\n\n\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

Rocket Pools is expanding its support for rETH across the L2 ecosystem, first Optimism, now Arbitrum and soon Polygon. There are currently only Chainlink Oracles for Arbitrum and Ethereum. Thus, this publication presents listing rETH on Arbitrum ahead of Optimism.\n\nA new rETH liquidity pool and gauge has been created on Balancer v2 Arbitrum for rETH/bb-a-wETH. This pool will deposit wETH into Aave v3 on Arbitrum. Incentives are expected to follow soon. This publication is early and provides risk service providers adequate time to review the asset listing parameters whilst liquidity continues to grow.\n\nLST collateral types drive material borrowing revenue to Aave as users deposit the LST and borrow the corresponding network token. This is most evident on Ethereum where the LST- and wETH-yield-maximising loop is the source of the vast majority of wETH borrowing demand.\n\nBy providing LST diversification, Aave presents itself as a neutral platform offering users the choice between various LSTs. An added benefit of offering a variety of LSTs is the respective communities may elect to compete for user acquisition via Aave through offering incentives. This is currently happening on Aave v3 Polygon and Aave’s TVL has meaningfully increased from a relatively small base.\n\nRocket Pool offers Aave v3 users on Arbitrum an alternative to wstETH.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?**\n\nLlama does not receive any payments from Rocket Pool.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token ?**\n\nRocket Pool strives to embody the core ethos of Ethereum and DeFi, specifically the non-custodial, trustless nature that allows self-sovereignty to truly thrive. This leads to reduced Counter Party risk relative to other LST providers.\n\nRocket Pool stakers deposit ETH into the deposit pool, enabling a node operator to create a new Ethereum Network validator. You can stake as little as 0.01 ETH.\n\nIn doing so, users are given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH is deposited, and when the user deposited it. The ratio includes rewards that Rocket Pool node operators earn from:\n\n* The Ethereum network itself\n* Priority fees from block proposals\n* MEV rewards from block proposals\n\nrETH is a staked, interest earning wrapper of ETH that can be exchanged at any time. rETH is not a rebasing token and therefore represents a straight forward integration prospect for Aave.\n\nSince the Beacon Chain rewards, priority fees, and MEV rewards will constantly accumulate, this means that rETH's value effectively always increases relative to ETH. The rETH/ETH exchange rate is updated approximately every 24 hours based on the Ethereum network rewards earned by Rocket Pool node operators.\n\n![|602x436](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sMlYJ-qPHfY2tYHe1Mhs1wJksUHoMuahfUR_vD-nFYn3vVC34buszhgTZv8oSjGQVTKUsGLm1jzBlkLCoR1bN_gGG6QWZyxiXkHFeFvxympIK7fw8zOjmGqI-Qsw-ErQBhruZk_eby90o8WwKgescPc)\n\nFor details on how to stake ETH with Rocket Pool, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/). For those readers keen to learn more about rETH taxation implications, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token).\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nBy listing rETH as collateral, users benefit from staking rewards whilst taking out a loan.\n\nSimilar to other LSTs, there are a range of yield maximising strategies and lower carry cost leveraged trading strategies that users could deploy. Given the typically low borrowing cost for LSTs, users are able to borrow the LST and participate in yield strategies beyond the Aave protocol.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nRocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH development.\n\nRocket Pool is designed to cater to two main user groups; those that wish to participate in [tokenised staking using rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-2-5-tokenised-staking-48601d52d924#92b0) using as little as 0.01 ETH and those that wish to stake ETH and run a node in the network to help generate a higher return on investment than staking outside of the protocol due to commissions earned.\n\nFor more information on these two groups that make up the protocol, we'd highly recommend [reading article one in our explainer series](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd) that goes into great detail on how users can participate, be it via tokenised staking or running a node in the protocol.\n\nThe core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party. This is a principle directly linked to Ethereum and ETH itself, and a mindset used at every stage of the process as Rocket Pool has evolved.\n\n![|602x216](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fqwfASEawOZPpIGTuda282owPW_7OJNQ2sK-XLi1Bq4Y09EpnHnfcehIr7n-3jHDqu02Iw676wV8RwPq0KcoUn9V1wtRRXGDF-wCRDdRO5_atRmJ2x2UjjkDRlv9zbOV2hcV1-hcevUGvulZOzLIGJI)\n\n**5. How is the rETH token currently used ?**\n\nThe distribution of rETH is spread thinning across many addresses. According to Arbiscan, the largest holding is only 3.13% of supply on Arbitrum.\n\nrETH is new to Arbitrum and because of this, there are only a few extrinsic use cases. Providing liquidity on DEXs is one of the main use cases to date on mainnet and we expect this to be mirrored on Arbitrum. The new rETH/bb-a-wETH pool will soon receive incentives and will bootstrap a second liquidity pool complementing the existing Uniswap v3 pool.\n\nWith supporting liquidity and an oracle derived from DEX and CEX liquidity across several networks, Aave is positioned to be the dominant rETH lending/borrowing liquidity pool on Arbitrum. For reference, there is currently [$20.03M](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) of rETH deposits on Aave v3 Ethereum.\n\nFor further insights into how rETH is integrated across the ecosystem, please refer to this Rocket Pool community-maintained Defi Opportunities publication.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. rETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\n* The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities\n\n**8.
