Latest rounds of Merit have been a success.\n\nMerit aims to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program, therefore it needs to be updated and adapted when narratives change and new strategies can be applied for future rounds.\n\nwETH supply is key for growth, as it is the biggest revenue source for Aave DAO. wETH is essential for the Aave DAO due to its role in enhancing liquidity, providing collateral, facilitating integrations, and driving user adoption, significantly increasing Aave's revenue through interest income, fees from liquidations, and increased platform usage.\n\nWith [**[ARFC] Deploy a Lido Aave v3 Instance**](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/18047) being at Snapshot stage, deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on the Lido ecosystem, aiming to support leveraged staking of stETH and wETH, benefiting both Aave and Lido users, it makes sense to align with Merit.\n\nFinally, with **[GHO being launched on Arbitrum](https://avara.xyz/blog/gho-stablecoin-now-live-on-arbitrum)** yesterday, it’s a strategic move to expand into Merit Program rewards for StkGHO to Arbitrum Safety Module if Governance approve its deployment. So for future Merit 6 Round, staking GHO to Arbitrum SM will be a reward action under Merit.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Boosters Update**\n\n- Removal of weETH in the “Diversity supporter” LST boost.\n- Removal of OG DAO participant (Booster for early DAO voters or delegates). This boost was meant to support early adopters, after 5 rounds of boost, it’s time to make all users, old and new on equal footing\n- Introducing wETH supplier “Eth Maxi” Boost: this will be a Boost for Ethereum and a pre-approval for wETH Arbitrum and Aave Lido markets, in order to incentivize them.\n\nIn order to be elegible for the Eth Maxi Boost, a user would need to either supply wETH (have awETH balance) and borrow GHO or stake GHO in order to have aStkGHO balance. this boost also apply to wETH suppliers on Arbitrum market\n\n- Introducing Ahab program to wETH suppliers to the Aave Lido Instance to initiate a Liquidity Mining Program.\n- Potentially expand Merit StkGHO to Arbitrum Safety Module if Governance approve its deployment.\n\nActivation of ACI as Emission manager for wETH on Mainnet, Arbitrum & if approved by governance on Aave lido market to implement Liquidity mining programs.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community consensus on this [ARFC Addendum].\n2. If there is agreement, escalate this [ARFC-Addendum] proposal to a Snapshot vote for formal approval.\n3. If [ARFC Addendum] is approved in Snapshot phase, apply changes to Merit Round 6.\n\n### Disclamer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes “Merit” without external compensation.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC-Addendum] Update Merit for Round 4\nDate: 2024-05-09\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nWe propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency, as well as evolving the wETH part of the merit program with a new program called “Ahab”.\n\n###  Motivation\n\nMerit’s first quarter and three initial rounds have been a clear success. Morpho Optimizers are now a dead product with zombie remaining TVL, and GHO grew to $54M despite unfavorable market conditions. The Aave protocol maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. While “Merit is Forever” has been approved by governance, we aim to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program.\n\n### Specification\n\n#### Boosters Update\n\nRemoval of “Second-degree user of aligned protocol”: due to lack of demand from second-degree protocols and investment in positioning Aave at the front row, this booster is no longer justified. We will reconsider reintroduction if some protocols show signs of Aave-alignment.\nIntroducing weETH in the “Diversity supporter” boost: weETH is the fastest-growing reserve in Aave V3 Ethereum, and this boost was designed to favor alternatives to main LST. It might be worth introducing a LRT to this boost.\nRemoval of OG DAO participant: this boost was designed to reward early participants in the Aave DAO, but it seems unfair for new users to keep having this boost after more than a quarter. We propose doubling the “Active in governance” boost to favor users supporting the DAO voting activity.\n\n#### Diluters Update\n\nStkGHO Cooldown users: we consider users declaring their intent to leave the safety module should not receive Merit rewards. A full dilution is seen as punitive and not in line with Aave’s ethos, so we propose stopping the points meter when these users call the cooldown method, allowing them to accumulate points until the cooldown activation.\nMorpho Users: The Morpho protocol continues to show direct hostility towards the Aave ecosystem onchain & offchain. We propose including all present and future Morpho products.\n\n#### Merit wETH Program\n\nThe merit wETH program has both been a total success and below expectations. This program has factually been the opportunity for >250k ETH to leave other protocols to join Aave, but these results are almost exclusively due to direct coordinated BD actions from Aave Finance & ACI with a small subset of “whale” users.\n\nWe consider it an inefficient allocation of resources to continue the program as it is. To upgrade this program, we propose focusing on the most efficient aspect and focusing on the BD “whale hunter” efforts. We propose rebranding this new part of the program as the “Ahab” program, which is expected to be significantly more budget-efficient than the current program.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community consensus on this proposed path.\n2. If there is agreement, escalate this ARFC-Addendum proposal to a snapshot vote for formal approval.\n\n### Disclamer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes “Merit” without external compensation.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

It also involves removing the StkGHO component from the \"Staker\" boost and approving the delayed start of GHO distribution.\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo expand the Merit reward system scope and address concerns about long-term AAVE rewards for StkGHO holders, we propose introducing a new rewarded action: \"Hold StkGHO.\" This change allows for a smooth transition to a safety module that is eventually 100% rewarded in GHO.\n\nWhile there is an overlap between \"Borrow GHO\" and \"Hold StkGHO\" rewarded users, this outcome is considered acceptable. The introduction of a new rewarded action for \"Hold StkGHO\" allows us to address concerns about rewarding users for non-enforcable actions due to the GHO borrow cap reached. \"Holding StkGHO is an incentive to liquidity sink GHO and secondary market demand.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\n1. Introduce a new rewarded action, \"Hold StkGHO.\"\n2. Remove the StkGHO component from the \"Staker\" boost to avoid circular logic.\n3. Approve the delayed start of GHO distribution within the Merit program.\n4. Prioritize StkGHO holders' rewarded actions over having GHO debt in the Merit distribution as long as the GHO borrow cap remains below 50M.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If this proposal reaches consensus on Snapshot, update the Merit reward system accordingly\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

It allows the DAO to restart GHO minting while keeping the peg in check.\n\nGHO is expected to provide 10% of all DAO overall revenue by next week.\n\nHowever, we have to witness less collaborative behavior from some ecosystem actors. In light of this, it seems suboptimal for the Aave DAO to reward uncollaborative protocols & behaviors.\n\nThis is why we suggest stopping any subsidies to the makerDAO ecosystem; the Aave DAO has already paid millions via the AAVE and third-party LM programs and has been repaid by creating competitive forks and activating D3M in a protocol that has stolen millions of revenue from this DAO with no safety track record using a market sensible collateral.\n\nWith this proposal, a single $ in Morpho Blue or Spark will nullify any Merit Airdrop for the user.\nsDAI is considered a makerDAO product, not a Spark product; holding simply sDAI or having it in Aave will not dilute a user.\n\nThis proposal aims to be enabled for Merit Round 2 and all subsequent rounds.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\n### Conservative Option\n\n1. Remove \"MakerDAO fren\" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral\n\n### Aggresive Option\n\n1. Remove \"MakerDAO fren\" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral\n2. Include Morpho Blue & Spark users in the \"User of Non-Aligned Protocol\" diluter.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If this proposal reaches a consensus on Snapshot, update the Merit reward system accordingly\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The system incorporates merit boosters and diluters to adjust user rewards based on their alignment with Aave's objectives. The initiative starts with a budget of 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO, totaling 5M$ for a 90-day duration, focusing on direct Aave protocol engagement and promoting diversified staking strategies.\n\n### Rewarded Actions\n\nActions that align with Aave's strategic objectives will be rewarded:\n\n| Action |\n| --- |\n| Borrow wETH |\n| Borrow GHO |\n\n### Merit boosters\n\nMerit boosters enhance these rewards for specific behaviors:\n\n| Behavior | Multiplier description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Second-degree user of aligned protocol | booster for users coming from aligned protocols that favor Aave over other protocols. |\n| Migrator | Incentive for moving positions to Aave from others protocols |\n| Diversity Supporter | Rewards for using minority LSTs |\n| Aavenger | usage of AAVE as collateral\n| MakerDAO fren | usage of sDAI as collateral\n| OG DAO Participant | Booster for early DAO voters or delegates |\n| Holdooor | Booster for ≥100-day AAVE holders in the past year |\n| Stakoor | Booster for ≥100-day StkAAVE holders in the past year |\n| Staker | Bonus for staking AAVE, StkBPT, StkGHO |\n| Active in Governance | Rewards for voting or delegating to an Aave DAO recognized delegate platform |\n\n### Merit Diluters\n\nMerit Diluters will dilute part or all rewards for certain behaviors:\n\n| Behavior | Dilution Description/Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| User of Non-Aligned Protocol | Severe dilution (up to -100%) |\n\n### Non-aligned protocol list:\n\nWe propose to launch Merit with a single protocol with non-aligned status: **Morpho Aave Optimizers V2 & V3**\n\n### Migration bonus multipliers list:\n\nWe propose to apply the “migratooor” Boosters to users leaving the following protocols to join the Aave ecosystem:\n\n- Morpho V2\n- Morpho V3\n- Morpho Blue\n- Spark\n\n\n### Budget and Scope\n\n- **Bi-Weekly Budget:** Defined by Aave Finance service providers, all data will be published publicly after the Merit program ends.\n- **Total Budget:** **5M$ with 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO for 90 days.**\n- **Scope:** Aave V3 Ethereum.\n\n### Synergies\n\nNumerous protocols reached out during the TEMP CHECK period to co-incentive merit; @karpatkey_TokenLogic via Aave Finance are coordinating these efforts, and their incentives are expected to be on top of the Merit budget.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Refine the proposal details based on community feedback to achieve consensus.\n2. Conduct a snapshot vote for community sentiment.\n3. Following a successful snapshot outcome, escalate to the AIP stage for official voting and implementation.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes \"Merit,\" without external compensation.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
