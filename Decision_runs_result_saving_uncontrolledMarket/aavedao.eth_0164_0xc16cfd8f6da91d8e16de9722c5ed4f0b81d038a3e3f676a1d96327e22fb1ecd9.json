        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy USDC and USDT GSM On Arbitrum\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-06-30\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes deploying a USDC and USDT GHO Stability Module (GSM) on the Arbitrum network. The two GSMs are to be maintained by the GHO Stewards.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe GSM provides stability to the GHO peg by enabling assets to be exchanged within a defined price band. Deploying a GSM on the Arbitrum network enables swaps to be filled without unnecessarily creating an arbitrage opportunity between networks. \n\nWith the LTIPP ARB grant coinciding with GHO being launched on Arbtirum, the Aave DAO can stimulate demand for GHO whilst also restricting the Bridge Facilitator mint cap to encourage users to mint GHO via the GSMs. User will also be able to swap USDC and USDT for GHO via aggregators that have integrated the GSM. This will lead to USDC and USDT being deposited into the GSM.\n\nWith a healthy balance of USDC and USDT in each respective GSM, the Bridge Facilitator cap can be raised more aggressively and a GHO Bucket Cap with Facilitor role can be introduced to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. \n\n# Specification\n\n\nThe below outline the proposed changes to be included in the governance proposal submission.\n\n## Ethereum\n\n### Arbitrum Focused Facilitator\n\n| Parameter  |     Value      | \n|    ---     |     :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units  | \n\n### CCIP Bucket Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|    ---     |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n## Arbitrum\n\n### CCIP Facilitator Capacity Adjustment\n\n| Parameter  |      Value      | \n|     ---    |      :---:      |\n| Mint Cap   |     +2M Units   |\n\n### GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the USDC and USDT GSMs that will be updated by the GHO Stewards post launch.\n\n| Parameter                         | Value   | \n| ------------------------             | :----:     | \n| Freeze Lower Bound        | $0.990 | \n| Freeze Upper Bound        | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound     | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound     | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee                   | 0.05% |\n| Burn GHO Fee                  | 0.20% | \n| Supply Cap                       | 1.00M  |\n\nAny deviation from the above will be shared in the comments section below prior to the AIP being submited for vote.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy aUSDC GSM on Ethereum\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-09-27\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes creating a more capital efficient aToken GHO Stability Modules (GSM) to replace the USDC GSM on Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWhilst the primary focus of the GSM is to ensure price stability during periods of price fluctuation. The current instance of the GSMs issue GHO into circulating supply and offer no additional revenue beyond the fee for interacting with the GSM. To date, both GSMs have generated a combined 21.9K USD in fees. \n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidxpse554hufcrksjc2you63l3abqnublk4h4cyg6inwdsquvomdy)\n    \nWith only 16M of combined USDC and USDT in the GSMs, the opportunity cost of holding aTokens in the GSM to date is 138.5k for the Aave DAO. However, during more recent times when GHO has been trading above peg and both GSMs have reached there Exposure Caps, the daily opportunity cost in lost yield is ~1.6k, which is equivalent to ~575k when annualised.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifay4gngo2u65tapm7brryjh22qrrt7smxbitkqlj6sjl7ezxrnma)\n    \nThe proposed GSMs will enable funds held within the GSM to earn yield and for this yield to go the DAO's treasury. Due to the enhanced capital efficiency, the USDC Exposure and GHO Bucket Capacity of the GSM can be sized based upon the lesser of the following:\n\n* Preferred amount of USDC exposure; or,\n* Available exit liquidity in the USDC reserve.\n\nEither of the above options, compares favourably when determining GSM parameters relative to configuring the Exposure Capacity for peg stability. If additional capacity is needed, a USDT aToken GSM can be deployed. \n\nThe aToken yield acts as a proxy for Borrow Rate on the Aave v3 market. Meaning GHO Minted from the GSM generates aUSDC yield and GHO Borrowed on Aave v3 generates interest. The aUSDC revenue is available every block as it accrues, unlike the interest accruing from GHO debt which Aave only receives if the user repays their loan.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposed instance of the GSM is intended to replace the existing USDC GSM, will enable 1:1 fixed-ratio swaps between USDC and GHO and utilizes the USDC surplus to mint aEthUSDC tokens. \n\naEthUSDC is instantly redeemable for USDC within the main Aave v3 deployment on Ethereum. The GSM can mint and burn aEthUSDC in exchange for USDC based upon user demand. \n\nSwap fees will be accumulated in GHO and surplus aEthUSDC will be claimable. A bot will be deployed to periodically claim the revenue to the DAO's treasury. \n\n![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkU3-Tp6R.png)\n\nA detailed specification will be shared during the ARFC phase.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Safety Module - Create GHO/USDC E-CLP Category\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-05-25\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes creating a new Safety Module (SM) category for the GHO/USDC E-CLP by Gyroscope built on Balancer v2.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the initial [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x1f0f0a63eeb34f9fc6a176527253495e43cefc28714734dbee79d9f33e943a67) vote passing, this publication progresses the proposal to add the GHO/USDC E-CLP to the Aave SM to ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\nWith GHO trading close to $1.00 and the [GHO Stability Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-fund-usdc-usdt-gsm/17566) to be funded, now is an ideal time to add a GHO LP to the SM. By adding the GHO-USDC E-CLP, it is expected to significantly improve market depth as well as USDC liquidity with the SM.\n\nThe GHO/USDC E-CLP pool requires dual asset deposits when Liquidity Providers enter the pool and when GHO is trading at $1.000, the pool is mostly USDC (75%). The pool's liquidity distribution is optimised for swap volume with Peak liquidity at 0.9995 reflecting that GHO is more likely to trade just beneath $1.000 than over. The upper and lower liquidity range was set to optimise the efficiency of the liquidity whilst still providing some USDC depth to the lower bound. The below provides a graphic representation of the liquidity profile and composition of the pool for GHO priced in USDC. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-05-23 at 18.45.52](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkfJ-baQ0.png)\n\n| Description   | Value  |\n| ------------- |:------:|\n| Lower Bound   | $0.996 |\n| Upper Bound   | $1.001 |\n| Peak          | 0.9995 |\n| Amplification | 1,250  |\n\nFuther details on the pool can be found [here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x006d7e2166472f62f0e9e5c95e3a313e01caea74000200000000000000000690).\n\nThe ability to stake GHO liquidity pool tokens improves the value proposition of the SM by providing the dual service of deep GHO liquidity and protection in the case of protocol shortfall events. Additionally, Liquidity Providers (LPs) can also benefit from earning trading fees.\n\n# Specification\n\nCreate a new GHO/USDC E-CLP SM Category which accepts the following Balancer Protocol Token (BPT).\n\nBPT: `0x006D7e2166472F62F0E9E5c95E3a313E01CaeA74`\n\nThe following initial E-CLP SM parameter configuration is proposed optimizing emissions for a target liquidity of $5M at 20% APR:\n\n| Description            | Value              |\n| ---                    | :---:              |\n| Emissions Nomination   | GHO                |\n| Daily Emission         | 2,750              |\n| Slashing Rate          | 50%                |\n| Cooldown Period        | 20 days            |\n\nThis proposal also recommends that GHO/USDC E-LCP is included in FastPass with the following initial parameters:\n\n| Description            | Value              |\n| ---                    | :---:              |\n| FastPass Fee           | 100 bps            |\n| Fee Destination        | Collector Contract |\n| Daily Withdrawal Limit | 500k               |\n\nIn addition to the above, we also recommend implementing the strategy detailed in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-gho-usdc-usdt-bpt-to-safety-module/15195) which enables the DAO via the vlAURA holding to vote BAL and AURA rewards to this SM Category. This option then enables the Aave DAO to use is strategic assets to partially sustain the SM category.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

While these two capacity increases fall under the Direct-to-AIP process, other future increases are not pre-approved and follow the ARFC process.\n\nTo facilitate the streamlining of GHO adoption on Arbitrum and other deployments beyond Ethereum, this publication proposes adjusting the following parameters to be included within the Direct-to-AIP process. \n\n* GHO Reserve Borrow Rate\n* CCIP Bridge\n* GHO Stability Module(s)\n* GHO Reserve funded exclusively from new facilitator on Ethereum\n\nThe Direct-to-AIP governance process enables the DAO to implement upgrades faster and more closely track market conditions. AIP votes will still be required until such time as the GHO Steward role is fully extended to support the new parameter adjustments not currently covered by the Risk Steward role.\n\nFor clarification, the following parameter adjustments are to continue following the ARFC process:\n\n* Safety Module emission rates\n* New GHO deployments\n* GHO Reserve Factor\n\nNote, risk parameters such as Supply Cap, Borrow Cap, and the ability to freeze a reserve are already approved as Direct-to-AIP with the implementation performed by the Risk Steward role.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis publication grants approval to adjust the following GHO related parameters via the Direct-to-AIP process.\n\n* GHO Reserve Borrow Rate\n* CCIP Bridge\n* GHO Stability Module(s)\n* GHO Reserve funded exclusively from new facilitator on Ethereum\n\nThis proposal covers the recent GHO on Arbitrum deployment and also, future GHO deployments beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.\n\nWith the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.\n\nBased upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates. \n\n## Non Frozen Assets\n\nFor non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d) has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.\n\nThe Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal. \n\nAs utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC. \n\nUpon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3. \n\nAssets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.\n\n## Frozen Assets\n\nEach frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.\n\nAssets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated as follows:\n\n| Asset | Current Slope1 | Proposed Slope1 | Current Uoptimal | Proposed Uoptimal | Current Slope2 | Proposed Slope2 |\n| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   |\n| BAL   | 27.00% | 50.00% | 65.00% | 20.00% | 236.00% | 500.00% |\n| CRV   | 17.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 392.00% | 500.00% |\n| DAI   | 12.00% | 12.75% | 71.00% | 71.00% | 105.00% |   200.00% |\n| GHST  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 23.00% | 10.00% | 413.00% | 500.00% |\n| LINK  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 402.00% | 500.00% |\n| USDT  | 12.00% | 12.75% | 52.00% | 52.00% | 236.00% |   236.00% |\n| wBTC  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 37.00% | 37.00% | 536.00% |   536.00% |\n| wETH  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 40.00% | 40.00% | 167.00% |   200.00% |\n| wMATIC|  6.00% |  6.75% | 48.00% | 48.00% | 440.00% |   500.00% |\n| wUSDC | 12.00% | 12.75% | 77.00% | 77.00% | 134.00% |   200.00% |\n\nSubject to approval from @ChaosLabs, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n4) Review, and where applicable, submit an AIP every 2 weeks\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
