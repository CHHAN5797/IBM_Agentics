By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3, Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and third-party teams.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nReental, in collaboration with Reental Master LLC, a protocol offering utility and functionalities associated with the Real World Assets (RWA) market, aims to deploy its collateralization market (ReenLever) on Aave's V3 platform. Reental stands as a global leader with extensive experience in real estate asset tokenization, having tokenized over $46 million across four countries on three continents. It uniquely combines these security tokens with its own utility token ($RNT), delivering significant benefits to its community of over 16,000 investors.\n\nReental is a key player in the global tokenization of RWAs, specifically in the real estate market. It offers investment opportunities in real estate assets to users worldwide. Currently, Reental has tokenized over 65 properties across four countries (USA, Spain, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic), totaling $25 million, with a community of 16,000 users from over 80 countries. \n\nWith this track record, Reental stands as the only company worldwide with tokenized properties across four countries on three continents, aspiring to become a global entity with properties tokenized worldwide and partnerships with some of the sector's most prominent corporations: Civitas, Grupo ClerHP, Grupo BEC, M2Capital, Sibarys Capital, and others. \n\nIn addition to its demonstrated traction as a leader in the Spanish-speaking RWA market over the past three years, Reental recently launched its utility token: $RNT. This tool enables the community to actively participate in the protocol, foster mutual growth, and transform user investors into stakeholders, creating a virtuous growth cycle.\n\n### Specification\n\nWe are witnessing a highly favorable trend and narrative regarding RWAs, and Aave can maintain its leadership by embracing the unstoppable growth of this ecosystem. Reental can contribute to this growth with its collateralized lending market.\n\nReental proposes launching a whitelisted Aave V3 instance, bringing along the current $46 million tokenized volume, which could be collateralized immediately, and the potential for billions more in the coming years.\n\n20% of the generated fees will be allocated to the Aave DAO. While the Reental market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO, and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver, the market has an interesting value proposition for off-chain collateral-based liquidity protocols.\n\nThis integration bridges the off-chain world with the on-chain realm through these RWAs, which are already yielding returns for investors.\n\nReental will assume the role of risk admin for this market, adding new properties monthly.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[www.reental.co](https://www.reental.co/)\n\n[https://dapp.reental.co/](https://dapp.reental.co/)\n\n[Additional information](https://assets-global.website-files.com/64883b1804f368bf8575ed2e/660eabf219338236d77f325f_White_Paper_Reental_V_1.0_-_ENG_3.pdf)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "—\nTitle: [ARFC] Proposal for Deploying “Whitelabel” Aave V3 Market for RealT Tokens on GnosisChain\n\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n\nDate: 2023-02-15\n\n—\nSummary:\nRealt is a Real Estate tokenization protocol that enables users to gain exposure to real estate properties that produce rent income directly paid on-chain. The RMM (RealT Market Maker) market based on Aave V2 has already reached ~10M$ in size since its launch.\n\nThis ARFC proposes deploying a “whitelabel” version of Aave V3 for RealT tokens on the Gnosis Chain network. By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3, Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and third-party teams.\n\nMotivation:\nThe quality of the Aave V3 codebase has made it a recognizable and trustworthy asset in the DeFi community as illustrated by spark protocol recent ARC 7.\n\nTherefore, rather than “reinventing the wheel,” many projects are interested in deploying “friendly” forks of V3 that fit their own models.\n\nAave is currently “delegating” off-chain collaterals to third parties, such as the Centrifuge RWA market, but this might change mid-term with GHO and off-chain collateral facilitators.\n\nAt present, Aave is immature in this area, so allowing third parties to deploy these “friendly forks” or Aave whitelabel deployments can increase Aave technology adoption.\n\nRealT proposes a 20% profit-sharing arrangement with the Aave DAO for this deployment. In this context, “profit” refers to the assets redirected to the RMM collector contract via the reserveFactor collection from users having borrow positions on this market. Quarterly, Realt will deliver 20% of the balance of this contract to the Aave Ethereum collector contract 7.\n\nIn the case of a future Aave V3 deployment on the Gnosis Chain, RealT will be able to implement a more automatic and decentralized way to deliver the revenue share to an Aave collector contract on the Gnosis Chain. This would allow for more seamless and efficient profit-sharing arrangements between RealT and Aave.\n\nWhile the RealT market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO, and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver, the RMM market has an interesting value proposition for off-chain collateral-based liquidity protocols.\n\nSpecification:\nNo on-chain AIP or technical implementation is required for this ARFC. Therefore, the outcome of a snapshot vote will be considered canon.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not linked nor paid by RealT to publish this ARFC.\n\nAt the time of writing, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, owns a small amount of RealT tokens in a wide range of properties that currently produce a weekly revenue of ~30 USDC.\n\nCopyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 30.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Website](https://artemisfinance.io)\n\n[X](https://x.com/Artemisfinance)\n\nDocuments:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/)\n\nAudit Report:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit)\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
