By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value (USDT) | Proposed Value (USDT) | Current Value (USDC) |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| LTV       | 0%                   | 74%                  | 74%                  |\n| LT        | 0%                   | 76%                  | 76%                  |\n| LB        | 0%                   | 4.5%                 | 4.5%                 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the ARFC Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Amend Safety Module AAVE Emissions\nAuthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative & @TokenLogic\nDate: 2023-09-24\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis publication proposes reducing AAVE (Safety Incentives) distributions to the Safety Module (SM) by 30% and introducing a 90-day SM emission cycle.\n\n## Motivation\nThe SM serves as the Aave Protocol’s self-protection smart contract. The Aave Protocol distributes 1,100 AAVE daily, split evenly across AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH deposits.\n\nFuture proposals shall discuss the composition and aim to improve the overall capital efficiency of the SM. However, this publication intends to reduce AAVE emissions in the immediate future, saving the DAO valuable AAVE emissions while the broader SM upgrade is being advanced. It is widely accepted within the community that Aave DAO is overpaying for AAVE and B-80BAL-20wETH deposits.\n\nThis publication proposes reducing AAVE emissions by ~30%. The revised AAVE emission is to be reduced from 1,100 AAVE/day to 770 AAVE/day. This represents a 330 AAVE/day reduction. The APR for stkAAVE holders is expected to reduce from 6.87% to 4.81%. Similarly, for the B-80BAL-20wETH deposits, yield is expected to fall from 14.35% to 10.05%.\n\nPlease note that the 80AAVE/20wETH Balancer v1 pool is to be migrated to Balancer v2 in the future. This will present the community with an opportunity to further revise the AAVE emissions. It may also occur at a time when the DAO has vlAURA and/or veBAL at its disposal.\n\nFor context, the Llama Part IV SM Upgrade suggests reducing the AAVE emission to stkAAVE holders by 75%. This is because slashing for stkAAVE is to be reduced, additional assets are to be added to the SM, and the emissions are to be redirected to those newly added assets. Since this proposal was published, stkAAVE has also gained the utility of discounted GHO borrowing rates.\n\nSimilarly, Xenophon Labs recommended doubling the slashing percentage from 30% to 60% on the stkAAVE pool and lowering emissions by 80 AAVE/day, from 550 to 470. While this publication does not propose amending the slashing rate, the reduction in AAVE emissions is about double.\n\n## Specification\nThe implementation for this proposal will be prepared by ACI. The table below shows the current and proposed daily AAVE Emissions.\n\n| Collateral           | Current Emissions | Proposed Emissions |\n|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| AAVE                 | 550               | 385                |\n| B-80AAVE-20wETH      | 550               | 385                |\n\nTransition to a 90-day period SM Emission schedule.\n\nA comparison between Xenophon Labs’ proposal and this proposal for stkAAVE holders is shown below:\n\n| TVL      | Slashing Rate | Protection | AAVE/day | AAVE Price | Annual Spend | Annual Cost per $ of Coverage | Deposit Yield |\n|----------|---------------|------------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| $175.0M | 30%           | 52.5M      | 550      | $60.00     | $12.045M     | $0.23                         | 6.88%         |\n| $175.0M | 60%           | 105.0M     | 470      | $60.00     | $10.293M     | $0.10                         | 5.88%         |\n| $175.0M | 30%           | 52.5M      | 385      | $60.00     | $8.431M      | $0.16                         | 4.82%         |\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclosure\nNeither ACI nor TokenLogic are compensated for the creation of this proposal by Aave Protocol.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The proposed risk parameters for LUSD will mirror those currently in place for USDC on the same pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by users of the Liquity Protocol. It has demonstrated its resilience and maintained a stable peg, even in volatile market conditions. By adding LUSD as a collateral asset on the Aave V3 ETH pool, we can offer our users more options for their DeFi activities. Furthermore, the integration of LUSD could potentially synergize with the GHO, enhancing liquidity and further reinforcing the stability of the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed risk parameters for LUSD on the Aave V3 ETH pool are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 77% |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 80% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 4.5% |\n\nThese parameters are identical to those currently in place for USDC on the Aave V3 ETH pool.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173/13) program, the ACI has not been compensated by any third-party to present this ARFC.\nAt the time of writing, the author does not hold LQTY tokens but owns some LUSD.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP for final approval and implementation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] Further increase GHO Borrow Rate\nauthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative\ncreated: 2023-10-05\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes a further increase in the GHO borrow rate by 50 basis points (bps), raising it from 2.5% to 3%.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave community has previously recognized the importance of adjusting the GHO borrow rate to maintain the stability and health of the protocol. The motivations for this proposal are:\n\n1. **Strengthening the GHO Peg**: The prior adjustment to the GHO borrow rate resulted in a stronger GHO peg. An additional increase is anticipated to further bolster the peg and get closer to the target value.\n2. **Enhancing GHO Revenue**: By increasing the borrow rate, the protocol is expected to generate additional revenue from GHO borrowings.\n3. **Coordinated Effort**: This proposal aligns with other initiatives, including the GHO buy program set of AIPs, as part of a coordinated effort to support the GHO peg.\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\n\nThis proposal also greenlights the ACI for a `direct-to-AIP` process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate. \n\n## Specification\n\n- Asset: GHO  \n- Contract Address: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f  \n- Current Borrow Rate: 2.5%  \n- Proposed Borrow Rate: 3%  \n- New discounted Borrow Rate: ~2.1%\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] TUSD Offboarding Plan Part II\nAuthor: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative  \nDate: 2023-09-17\n--\n\n## Summary\nThis ARFC proposes the continuation of the [TUSD offboarding plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-tusd-offboarding-plan/14008) from Aave V2 by adjusting its risk parameters, mirroring the approach taken in the \"[ARFC] BUSD Offboarding Plan Part III\".\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of stablecoins offboarding of the Aave V2 market.\nTUSD is proposed to adopt the \"final stage\" offboarding parameters to incentivize repayment and withdrawal of liquidity in Aave V2 Pool\n\naBUSD will be withdrawn and converted to BUSD.\n\nThis ARFC also aims to authorize the ACI to publish regularly \"withdraw aToken\" mechanical AIPs that have low governance value. Part of the success of these offboarding plans relies on maintaining the available liquidity low, adding pressure on borrowers, and incentivizing repayment or, if there's a lack of reaction, accelerating HF decay to create liquidations.\n\nWe believe that once the governance approves the offboarding plans and once an asset reaches the \"final\" stage of interestStrategy curve, there's little to no governance value in going through the snapshot phase each time. A direct-to-AIP approach seems sufficient. \n\n## Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters Adjustment\n\nThe risk parameters for TUSD on Aave V2 will be adjusted as follows:\n\n| Parameter              | Previous Value | New Value |\n|------------------------|----------------|-----------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)    | 0%             | 0%       |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 75%       | 65%      |\n| Liquidation Bonus      | 10%            | 10%      |\n| Reserve Factor         | 95%            | 99.9%    |\n| uOptimal               | 20%              | 1%       |\n| Base Rate              | 0%              | 100%     |\n| Slope 1                | 10%              | 70%      |\n| Slope 2                | 200%              | 300%     |\n\n## Disclamer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If community consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage\n3. if snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
