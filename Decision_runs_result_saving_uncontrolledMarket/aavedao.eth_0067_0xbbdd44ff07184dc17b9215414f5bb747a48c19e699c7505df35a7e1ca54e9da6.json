        "body": "# Summary\n\nAs continuation of the engagement finished 1st October, present to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development and security coordinator services.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nTime flies in DeFi, and it has already been two and a half years since BGD started working for the Aave DAO.\nDuring this time, the market has gone up and down, new protocols have appeared, and CEXes have fallen. But the Aave protocol remains, and, following almost any metric, it has grown.\n\nTogether with the work of other service providers, we want to believe our contribution has had an important role in both the stability of Aave (creating solid trust) and the growth itself, with tech enabling all new types of use cases while maintaining the highest standards of security.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nDuring the last 3 engagements between BGD Labs and the Aave DAO, all pieces of the Aave infrastructure have been worked on: the Aave protocol itself with new versions and maintaining the current ones, the Aave governance, bridging infrastructure, all rails for expansion to new networks and use cases, supporting non-technical contributors to maximise their value without being blocked by tech; basically everything.\n\nThe motivation/goal of this new engagement is:\n\n- Keep the stability and trust in the Aave technology.\n- Innovate responsibly on production systems.\n- Support all other non-tech contributors to the DAO, accelerating progress.\n\nIn summary, the same as before, but always striving for better.\n\n\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## Aave <> BGD Phase IV (continuous) scope\n\nThe scope of this Phase IV builds upon all previous phases, and as commented, is focused on continuous maintenance and development of the Aave ecosystem technical infrastructure, in combination with security coordination and support to other contributors.\n\nMore specifically, the services include the following:\n\n- **Propose improvements on top of the current Aave v3.2 production version**. This will include minimum a v3.3 and v3.4 versions, but with quite certainty, more.\n    \n    Additionally, we have several other ideas to improve the core protocol, which will be unveiled to the community as soon as the feasibility research is positive.\n    \n- **BGD will take back the scope of deploying to new networks and pool instances**. As commented on our Phase 3 final recap, we identified that having different entities on the deployment stage of Aave v3 creates more overhead than benefit. So we think for Phase IV it is more optimal to get the following entities involved in the activation procedures:\n    - BGD Labs will perform all the pre-governance proposal stages (deployment of required smart contracts, adaptation of all tooling, and development of the activation proposal itself).\n    - As it currently happens, Certora will review the on-chain governance proposal once submitted, in order to have redundancy.\n- **Maintain Aave Governance v3 and a.DI**. In this phase, the effort will be on improving the user interface owned by the Aave DAO, and on the a.DI side, increasing even more the visibility on the infrastructure (on https://adi.onaave.com/), streamlining upgrade procedures via governance proposals, and on-demand, enabling new paths and bridge providers.\n    \n    Additionally, with the rollups ecosystem evolving (e.g. ZK-based), we will once again evaluate the expansion of voting to other networks, an item we removed priority on the previous engagement as the return of resources investment was not there.\n    \n- **Aave bug bounty program**. After already close to 1 year of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty being active, we plan to make certain improvements to it. Same time, we will remain as reviewers, addressing all the submissions and the different stages until bounty payment.\n- **v2 further off-boarding**. At the beginning of the previous Phase 3, Aave v2 pools were still very meaningful instances of the protocol, both in size and usage. Currently, different off-boarding initiatives (both from us and other contributors) have reduced a lot the role of v2 in the ecosystem versus v3. During this engagement, we will proceed/support further proposals for off-boarding of v2, with the target being reaching a scenario where only very major assets stay (e.g. WETH, stETH, USDC, USDT), but everything else naturally gets finally migrated to v3.\n- **Focus on Aave Stewards and additional infrastructure delegation**. We believe the path of using what we name the Stewards pattern is most probably the future direction of Aave:\n    - The Aave Protocol (v3) is the base layer of smart contracts, enforcing the highest-order validations and general settlement logic. Decentralized, with only the Aave Governance having “super-admin” control.\n    - The protocol delegates operational/management functions to other smart contracts, the Stewards. These are highly constrained on-chain agents, that allow for faster and more optimal operations, but that can lose this power at any point if the Aave Governance decides so, and with low capacity to create any damage on the protocol.\n    - Currently, the Stewards are focused mainly on optimizing risk parameter updates, but we envision extending this pattern to multiple areas, for example, finance (a Finance Steward is in the advance stage by the treasury contributors).\n    \n    Our role in Stewards development will involve 1) defining an approach that is scalable enough for the current and future needs of the DAO 2) developing the core Steward contracts we believe require our involvement 3) if optimal, supporting other contributors to create their own Stewards, or modifying existing ones for the needs of the DAO.\n    \n- **Umbrella support post-release**. In Phase 3, we included a separate scope for the creation from scratch of Umbrella, a new version of the current Aave Safety Module. Scheduled to be released pretty soon, the project will require post-release support, mainly in the shape of:\n    - Supporting non-BGD contributors involved in all Umbrella operations, for example, regulation of incentives, and risk considerations like choosing correct targets.\n    - Improvements post-release.\n    - Iterating on tooling after the initial effort included with the previous Umbrella scope.\n- **Aave protocol security coordinator**. Same as in our previous engagement, this involves:\n    - Continuously evaluate technical risks for Aave.\n    - Address events involving any vulnerability affecting Aave. This includes also creating governance proposals if required.\n    - Act as technical support for the Aave Protocol and Governance Guardians: define and document plans of action, communicate with both of them whenever a reaction is needed, and also properly disclose to the community activity on Guardian.\n- **Aave proposals reviews**. We will review all governance proposals before they go on-chain, the same as we have been doing last year. This acts as the first layer of security and quality, minimizing any potential issue to be detected on the on-chain stage by Certora, on their line of contribution.\n- **Maintenance and improvement of all tooling of the Aave ecosystem**. During the previous phases, we created multiple tools and projects on the off-chain side of Aave, like Aave Address Book, the Aave Proposals repository, Aave Helpers, the Aave Config Engine and a myriad of others. During this new Phase, we will keep improving them and creating anything new needed.\n- **Analysis for candidate networks to activate Aave v3**. Even if the plan on the previous scope was to off-board network analysis, finally we decided to keep performing them ourselves, as the overhead of supporting another entity would not have been good resource allocation.\n    \n    In this new scope, we will continue performing this analysis.\n    \n\n\n---\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phases II & III, 6 months: starting from the moment the previous engagement ended (1st October 2024) and lasting until 1st April 2025.\n\n**BUDGET**: 2’300’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 50% paid up-front and 50% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n---\n\n\n## What is NOT part of both the scopes\n\nSimilar as on Phase 3, we want to be explicit on what is not included in our line of contribution:\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora. On our side, we only do a best-effort review if we deem it appropriate.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor. Given our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so. Any tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n- Very ad-hoc projects will depend on the pipeline of priority, and potentially will be budgeted/estimated independently, if we see they will have important implications on the scope that we need to fulfil and/or not fitting in this initial estimation. For example, any projects like Umbrella will be budgeted apart, and we don’t disclose them at the moment, due to being in feasibility research phase.\n\n\n# Terms of Service\n\nA formal Terms and Conditions document for the engagement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs can be found [HERE](https://bgdlabs.com/aave-dao-tos).\n\n\nWe would like however to highlight again the same high-level points as on Phase 3, which we thing are very important for the ethos of the DAO:\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the core software (e.g. all on-chain smart contracts to be used by the DAO in production) we create during our engagement are licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to new Aave v3 version, Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication:\n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if already doing it by commercialising all the different Aave products, we believe in the near future IP and licensing commercialisation is something the DAO should put focus on, at the same time common good infrastructure is released.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n- **We don’t work with competitors of the Aave DAO**. To do the type of work we do on Aave, the community should trust us as service provider. To avoid any type of conflict, we compromise to not work with any competitor of the Aave DAO for any type of financial gain.\n\n\n# Disclosures\n\nBGD Labs has no meaningful commercial relation with entities that could create any type conflict of interest on the scopes of this proposal.\nSimilar as during the previous years, the majority of our focus is on core development and security services on Aave (exclusive provider): we have absolutely no engagement with any entity that could be perceived as competitor of the Aave DAO and we will not during the duration of this Phase 4.\n\n\n# Next steps\n\nIf the outcome of this pre-approval Snapshot ARFC is positive, we will proceed with the final AIP on-chain proposal, which will act as binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs",

        "body": "# Summary\nPresent to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development services, after Phase 1 and 2.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 1. Motivation. Aave and BGD 1, 2….3\n\nMay 9th 2022, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 1, a proposal for services to the DAO, covering a pretty extensive scope on the big majority of Aave sub-systems; development and security related.\n\nDuring the following 15 months, we [did or participated in dozens of projects](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-working-day-365/13033)  of technical nature for the Aave DAO, and more importantly, we set precedent that a model of a fully independent company providing services to a decentralised entity can work.\n\nSeptember 4th 2023, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 2, with similar type of scope as Phase 1, but with slightly different objectives in mind: the technical foundation of the Aave DAO was pretty solid from Phase 1, and possible to iterate on top of it, with a more concrete scope.\nAdditionally, we set ourselves as a goal to study how to introduce extra technical parties to service specific needs of the DAO, helping more on the decentralisation of the organisation, but without disturbing operations and delivery.\n\nAlso, we proposed a way shorter engagement (6 months), which we thought was more optimal for the DAO to have capacity to manoeuvre. The outcome of this work can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bored-ghosts-phase-2-recap/16791).\n\n\n\nWe think that our services to the DAO on both Phases had played a role on Aave staying in top of its category for years in so nascent field, and the Aave codebase being used in other products, accounting to close to 75% of total market share category.\n\nNow we present Phase 3, continuist, but with some important changes in terms of scope.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 2. Specification. Aave <> BGD Phase III. The scope\n\nThis time, we want to explicit divide our proposal in 2 different and explicit components, each one with its separate scope, budget and duration characteristics.\n\n## Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO\n\nThis scope is the continuist component historically performed by BGD for the DAO, and will be composed of the following items:\n\n- Maintain, improve and consolidate all the Aave tooling introduced in Phases I & II, including but not limited to Aave Address Book, Aave Helpers, Aave Proposals, Risk Stewards, Seatbelt and Killswitch.\n- Maintain and improve Aave Governance v3, a.DI and Aave Robot, together with the tooling surrounding them.\n    \n    The following new items will be delivered, consequence of the research done on Phase 2:\n    \n    - Extend coverage of voting networks to rollups, apart from the current Polygon PoS and Avalanche C-Chain.\n    - Allow voting with AAVE tokens held in non-Ethereum networks.\n    - Granular and generalised consensus rules for a.DI, together with different planned optimisations.\n- Propose further improvements on top of the upcoming Aave 3.1.\n- Different v3 maintenance tasks with important development requirements, including:\n    - Improve asset off-boarding procedures.\n    - Complete removal of stable debt logic.\n- Act as reviewers of Aave <> Immunefi for all current Aave ecosystem, not including GHO (Avara currently being the reviewer). Additionally, doing proper maintenance of the bug bounty program.\n- Act as security coordinator of the Aave ecosystem, including:\n    - Continuously evaluate potential technical risks for Aave.\n    - Design specific protection strategies in the event of any vulnerability affecting Aave.\n    - If arising, create governance proposals to mitigate any type of problem affecting Aave.\n    - Coordinate with the Aave Guardian for protective emergency actions.\n- Support with further technical off-boarding strategies for legacy versions of Aave (v1, v2) in a safe manner, both for the DAO and the users of the protocol.\n- Advise other contributors on which security procedures to apply for their developments, when required.\n- Evaluate new upcoming high-level technical implications/risks for the protocol, for example, new types of assets being listed.\n- Generally advise other contributors, whenever feedback from an entity expert on the Aave protocol is required. This includes but is not limited to contributors on the risk, treasury, security reviews and miscellaneous fields.\n- Review governance proposals on pre-onchain stage, not as a full security audit, but in order to verify that we don’t see any integration problem with Aave’s smart contracts and good practises.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO*\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phase 2, 6 months, starting from proposal execution.\n\n**BUDGET**: as some items are not included in the scope (more later), the budget has been reduced from Phase 2. 1’600’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 60% paid up-front and 40% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n\n## What is NOT part of the scope\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor.\nGiven our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so.\nAny tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Scope 2: Aave Safety Module - Code A\n\nAs commented before, we believe now the Aave DAO is in a really solid stage of their current systems, quite future-proof and ready to scale:\n\n- Aave v3 is a solid liquidity layer, on which is possible to iterate and improve.\n- Aave Governance v3 is probably the most advanced on-chain governance system in production.\n- a.DI is a totally generic bridging layer, that can be used for any cross-chain communication need on the Aave ecosystem, in a secure and scalable manner.\n- Aave Robot is a solid automation layer, integrated with Chainlink Automation, but flexible enough for any technology.\n\nMore in the line of innovative projects like Aave Governance v3, we propose to create a completely new system in an Aave component which requires improvement: the Aave Safety Module.\n\n\n### Aave Safety Module: Code A\n\nSafety Module Code A is the major project on the innovation side of this scope, but different to previous cases, our proposed approach is different: at the moment, we will not disclose a detailed description of it, as we think this is the right strategic approach for the DAO.\n\nHowever, we can say the following about Code A:\n\n- It will change completely the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE and stkABPT.\n- More efficient mechanism than the current.\n- Improved use experience.\n- Heavily improved dynamics for builders to build on top, but still batteries included.\n- Affecting importantly AAVE tokenomics.\n- Holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO.\n- Directly/indirectly benefiting any future project of the DAO.\n\nWe are aware this requires some trust by the community on our research and execution capabilities (which is reflected on the payment schedule), but considering that the main beneficiary will be explicitly the DAO and our history of services, we think it is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 2. Safety Module Code A*\n\n**DURATION**: this scope is not continuous like Scope 1, but our estimation is similar for full completion, approximately during the next 6 months to have everything fully ready and in production.\nHowever, delivery and communications will definitely be iterative, with extensive details of Project A to be disclosed in the first 2 months, and highly probably some of its components.\n\n**BUDGET**: 1’900’000 in stablecoins and 7’500 AAVE, with the following schedule:\n\n- 40% upfront.\n- 60% in a delayed payment in 4-months from now, when we estimate to be in good stage of completion.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Terms of Service\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the major software we have produced during our engagement have been licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication: \n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if other models can be explorer, from our point of view, this is a pretty solid contribution model for the innovation side of the DAO.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Next steps\n\nIf this ARFC Snapshot is positive, we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal that will serve as formal and binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs, on the terms defined.",

The protocol's TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.\nThe Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.\nThis has allowed the Aave DAO not only to \"cover its own bills\" but also has built [a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury).\n\n \n![treasury.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihrskqratcejxrmldlzopv4lj42esks3cgel2kugnd3ijzlt4leui)\n    \n\nAdditionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol's net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH & ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main & new markets.\n\nWith the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol's maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.\n\nThis journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.\n\nTo ensure the DAO's long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.\n\n## Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift\n\nThe Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.\n\nFortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of \"cash\" DAO treasury funds.\n\nHowever, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.\n\nWith both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:\n\n1. The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.\n2. The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.\n\nWhile it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.\n\nTherefore, Umbrella proposes:\n\n1. Segregation of coverage\n2. Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity\n\nFrom now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.\n\nUmbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role & benefits of the AAVE assets & tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey\n\nAs an initial and immediate step:\n\nWe propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.\n\nWith this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.\n\nGHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets' debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.\n\nHowever, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.\n\nSafety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO <> GHO exchange rate, but it's a risk they willingly accepted by staking.\n\nExample: If there's 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).\n\nThis paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.\n\nThis will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.\n\nThese changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.\n\nWe propose adopting the following:\n\n### Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:\n\n1. The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.\n2. The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.\n3. The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.\n4. Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol \"local\" net excess revenue.\n\n\n### StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey\n\nGHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.\n\nCurrently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.\n\nWe propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.\n\nThe Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.\n\nThis will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a \"base yield\" paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an \"Airdrop\" yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining \"boosts\" of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable \"base yield\" for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.\n\nIn practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.\n\nThis will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.\n\n## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.\n\nAAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it's simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.\n\n### End the \"Seize and Sell\" Doctrine\n\nThe \"seize and sell\" doctrine is dangerous as it's inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.\n\nAdditionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.\n\nLastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.\n\nWe propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.\n\n### StkBPT Redefinition\n\nThe Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE's secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.\n\nWhile the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.\n\nThe DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.\n\nWe propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a \"Buy & Distribute\" program funded by the protocol's excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.\n\nThe ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.\n\nThis will increase the Safety Module's budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.\n\nIn this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.\n\n### Introduction of Anti-GHO\n\nCreating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.\n\nWe propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.\n\nThe users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user's will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.\n\nAnti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:\n\n1. Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt \"for free.\"\n \n![burn anti gho mint.png](ipfs://bafkreifvldjg2ivjc3x7li4hmv4v4bde5xii6p6vwnlm6cdh62zgtlwv5m)\n    \n\n2. Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.\n\n \n![holders stkaave.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibylsxdbvqvwllrvmkd3x6b7e6dqcvuo6tnbevzz5g7jppb2hjp7a)\n    \n\n\nBoth special-purpose facilitators' \"debt\" will be regularly \"cleared\" by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.\n\nThis new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.\n\n### Closing the LEND chapter\n\nNearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.\nAfter a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.\n\nWe consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.\n\n## Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics\n\nThe Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.\n\nAdditionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.\n\nThe paradigm shift to \"seize and burn\" instead of the current \"seize and sell\" increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.\n\nThis is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.\n\nMost of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.\n\nTherefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.\n\nThis allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.\nBecause debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.\n\nTo cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.\n\naTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.\n\nUmbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.\n\nDetails and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk & Finance teams.\n\nWe’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.\n\n### Activate a \"Buy & Distribute\" Program\n\nWith the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.\n\nIn terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a \"Buy & Distribute\" program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.\n\nThere's little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it's a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.\n\nIt is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.\n\nRewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.\n\nWe propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the \"Buy & Distribute\" program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program \n\nFor an easier understanding of the new AAVEnomics vision, please consider the following visual representation:\n\n \n![visual representation.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigfqm7tms5yc2homzrgar6ikt6bbplco4cejmqg5i7jqngalmm2eq)\n    \n\n## “Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave\n\nAave's Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module. With the Umbrella upgrade, we expect the efficient coverage to increase significantly compared to the current situation, from a theoretical $100m to likely billions of mid-terms.\n\nThe Aave DAO can mobilize and monetize this coverage beyond the Aave protocol. The Aave DAO service providers are risk experts who can give valuable coverage recommendations to the Aave governance.\n\nThe Umbrella multi-token incentives controller allows for rewards in several tokens, and we believe this cost-efficient coverage of already existing significant liquidity will be of high interest for third-party protocols and networks, as shown by the high interest of the “Restaking” DeFi vertical.\n\nWhile the journey to maturity on this vertical is still long, the ACI wanted to share this mid-term vision to the community of a potential new journey for protocol revenue and Umbrella Stakers Yield.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Milestones and Trigger Conditions\n\nWhile the Aave protocol's net excess revenues are at an all-time high, it would be reckless to implement significant new budget spending without considering the protocol's long-term sustainability.\nFrom a user experience perspective, a too-ambitious distribution schedule being forced to halt due to more adverse revenue collection conditions will lead to massive and unwanted frustration.\nThe Aave DAO has always been a conservative actor and has always prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term yield.\n\nWe suggest considering the following elements as key data points to execute changes in Safety Modules in steps:\n\n- Aave Collector net holdings\n- Service providers' recurring budget\n- Merit and ALC program recurring budgets\n- GHO supply\n- GHO 30-day average revenue\n- Protocol 30-day average revenue\n\nThe ACI Proposes this vision to be implemented in 3 differents ARFCs to be sequentially proposed alongside reaching set milestones, we welcome governance feedback on this implementation Journey.\n\n## Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO\n\nAdoption of the Following Doctrine:\n\n1.

        "body": "# Summary\nProposal to pre-approve the activation of Aave v3.2 across all Aave pool instances, a new version of v3 (currently v.3.1) including two important changes:\n\n- A new feature: Liquid eModes.\n- The removal of all deprecated stable rate logic.\n\n\n# Context\nJuly 27th, Aave governance proposal 132 3 activated Aave v3.1 across all active networks. This currently active version of the Aave protocol was focused on security improvements (e.g. introducing virtual accounting), changing the architecture of the interest rate strategies, and multiple other updates to improve the operational efficiency of the system.\n\nAdditionally, with Aave v3.1 we introduced Aave v3 Origin 4, a new repository for the Aave protocol (Foundry-based) to serve as the cornerstone to release further post-v3.1 versions faster while keeping maximum security standards.\n\nOne and a half months later, as a result of previous groundwork with v3.1 and Origin, we are glad to present to the community this new Aave v3.2 version.\n\n## Aave v3.2\nThe changes included in Aave v3.2 are more isolated than those of v3.1, and of different nature. While removing stable rate-related logic is more on the maintenance/codebase cleanup side, liquid eModes is a total user-facing and powerful feature.\n\n### 1 -  Liquid eModes\n\nAave v3 introduced the concept of eMode (efficiency mode), an abstraction within the pool for configuring groups of assets with more capital-efficient risk configurations (LTV, Liquidation Threshold). This unlocked use cases like native high-leverage or even strategies between stablecoins. eMode could be deemed one of the first experiments in DeFi at scale with the concept of pools of assets within pools of assets.\n\nThe eMode feature has seen since then tremendous success, enabling use cases like ETH-correlated eMode, allowing for higher than default risk parameters on ETH LSTs/ETH positions (or MATIC, AVAX with their LSTs). However, the eMode feature always had some room for improvement, that way truly unlocking even more powerful use cases and flexibility on Aave.\n\nA known technical limitation of the initial iteration of eMode is the following: a single eMode is optionally assigned to assets listed on Aave. That means that if let’s say WETH is assigned eMode 1 eligibility (ETH-correlated, with ETH LSTs), WETH can’t be eligible for any other eMode.\n\nIn different scenarios, this is an important constraint, as currently is not possible to have on the same Aave pool an eMode with wstETH and WETH, together with a different eMode with weETH and WETH, as WETH can only be in one of them at the same time.\n\n\n\nThe new Liquid eMode feature of Aave v3.2 removes the previous constraint: an asset listed on Aave can be eligible for different eModes, and then it only depends on the user to choose which eMode he wants to enter to.\n\nFor example, with liquid eModes, a possible configuration not doable before would be:\n\n- eMode 1, with wstETH, weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 2, with wstETH and WETH.\n- eMode 3, with weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 4, with WETH and GHO.\n\nSo then, user A holding the wstETH and weETH collaterals, could borrow WETH at high LTV. User B holding only wstETH could borrow WETH at high (but different) LTV. User C holding only weETH could similarly borrow WETH at a different LTV than the previous two eModes. User D could have a position with WETH collateral and GHO borrowings.\n\nThis doesn’t stop there, as more sophisticated configuration strategies could be adopted, like:\n\n- eMode for only WETH and stablecoins.\n- eMode for onboarding less mature LSTs, without requiring them being together with all major LSTs.\n\nFor extra configuration flexibility, liquid eModes also allow now to flag an asset as only borrowable, only collateral, or both, in the context of an eMode. For example, in a hypothetic eMode with only wstETH and WETH, the normal configuration would be wstETH as only collateral and WETH as only borrowable, fully focusing on the wstETH leverage use-case.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the previous main characteristics of liquid eModes, we have also introduced the following minor changes to the system:\n\n- Now the protocol doesn’t enforce the LTV/LT of an asset being lower outside its eligible eModes. However, the validation gets stricter on the user side when entering any eMode (or from no-eMode): Health Factor is always validated to never allow the user to get his position below 1HF post-eMode swap.\n- The protocol previously had an eMode-specific price feed, to be used to price with the same feed all assets on an eMode. However, this has never been used, and its utility (in its current form) is quite arguable. Therefore, we have to remove it from the data structure to allow more efficient storage allocation.\n- On a technical note, before 3.2, the eMode of an asset was stored on the asset’s data itself. Now, the eMode data stores all the necessary information for the protocol to understand which assets are eligible on that eMode.\n- Similar as with previous upgrades on Aave v3, we have tried to follow a non-invasive approach when adding the feature, only touching/refactoring those pieces that were clearly necessary, but without doing any big high-level refactoring of the pool.\n\n### 2 - Stable rate logic cleanup\n\nPart of the v.3.1 upgrade was the addition of a function swapToVariable() for anybody to permissionless off-board stable borrowings to variable, that way factually deprecating completely stable rate on Aave pools.\n\nWith currently no active stable rate position (moved via the Dolce Vita program by the service provider ACI 4), we have executed a follow-up step on the process: completely removing the stable rate logic from the protocol, which one hand simplifies the codebase, but on the other hand it also slightly optimises gas consumption and logic flows.\n\nEven if fairly extensive change, this cleanup is non-invasive in how the protocol operates given that there are no active stable rate positions. All technical details about it will be included in the upcoming v3.2 release technical changelog.\n\n## Security\nIn addition to all standard internal procedures on BGD Labs (testing, review), the external security processes are getting finished. Before the final AIP, they will be properly communicated in the Aave governance forum.\n\nSimilar as with any other Aave v3 upgrades, the AIP proposal will include compensation for the cost of the external security procedures.",

Extensive details about its rationale and specifications can be found on Snapshot and the associated governance forum.\n\nThis ARFC delves more into the proposed initial configuration details of the initial phase (Phase 1).\n\n# Specification\nTo recap, the architecture of the new Chainlink SVR feeds to be connected to Aave is as follows:![svr-diagram-arfc.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidkqa26w7eaqaq34a2fnaz6goy7acu6g36w4jy5byb5oqsmtdfl3q)\n\nIn the integration side of Aave, there are two major components to take into account:\n\n- **SVR Feed**. This will be the one plugged into the Aave Oracle smart contracts (with the necessary CAPO adapters on top if applicable), receiving the OEV-recapturing price on-chain.\n- **Fallback feed**. This is a mirror of the “standard” price feeds currently plugged into Aave, without OEV recapture. The SVR Feed has a configurable delay fallback in seconds: as both SVR and Fallback feeds get submitted to their respective mempools in parallel, whenever the OEV doesn’t reflect on-chain for more than the delay fallback seconds but the Fallback does, the price reading is routed to the Fallback feed.\n\nThe fallback mechanism is completely fundamental security-wise, as it gives one important assurance: on average, the price availability of the overall system will be equal to or superior to the current feeds, but even in the worst-case scenario, the maximum delay to read from a “standard” Chainlink feed will be of the configured delay fallback seconds.\n\n## Initial assets configuration: controlled approach\nEven considering that the technology (Chainlink, Flashbots) is battle-tested, and the protection mechanisms embedded into SVR like the fallback, we believe the rollout of feeds should be progressive, only enabling a very limited subset of assets on v3 Core Ethereum during the first month or so.\n\nFrom our discussions with Chainlink, we think the following principles for choosing the initial assets are reasonable:\n\n- The assets consuming the feeds should have a meaningful volume of historic liquidation.\n- The majority of liquidations happening on positions consuming the chosen feeds should be due to those feeds, and not due to other assets. E.g. in positions using AAVE as collateral and borrowing USDC, the majority of liquidations happen due to the AAVE/USD price feed updates on the collateral side, as the USDC/USD feed barely changes.\n- In this first activation batch, major assets size-wise should be avoided: ETH, wstETH, WBTC, weETH.\n- Ideally, we plug in production feeds that will affect assets correlated with major ones, but smaller in size. Both tBTC and WBTC use the hood of the same BTC/USD feed, but the first is ~$82m in size versus the second ~$3b.\n\nWith the previous principles in mind, and also taking into account the extensive testing/simulations performed by Chainlink in their infrastructure during the previous couple of months, the recommendation is to enable the following SVR feeds:\n\n- **BTC/USD affecting exclusively LBTC and tBTC**.\n- **AAVE/USD**.\n- **LINK/USD**.\n\n## Other configurations: fallback delay and its nuances\nWhen choosing specific values per asset for a fallback delay, there are different points of consideration:\n\n- The fallback delay is a mechanism that will not be used on the “happy” path: when the Chainlink DON submits prices to the Flashbots auction, historical analysis shows that the majority of price updates (and so liquidations) are included in the next block, and close to 100% in the range of 1-2 blocks. That means that price reading being redirected to the “public” feed will only happen if a fallback delay is configured to less than 2 blocks (in seconds), or in very edge scenarios when auction participants don’t show up for more than 2 blocks, even if economically sound.\n- Aside from the auction aforementioned average auction speed of 0-2 blocks, configuring too low (e.g. 2 blocks) the fallback delay opens to an edge, but theoretically existing censorship vector: it could be profitable for a builder with control to build the +2 block from next on the public mempool to censor the price update on the 2 blocks on the Flashbots auction, to wait for their to-be-mined block on the public mempool.\nAgain, this vector is very theoretical but technically exists whenever the fallback delay is very short. Any increase in the fallback delay configuration makes the censorship vector exponentially more expensive, as the cost of “capturing” multiple blocks in a row gets increasingly more expensive,\n- Aave is configured very conservatively risk-wise, which means that the difference of processing a liquidation in the same block of price update versus some blocks after doesn’t put the system at all at risk.\nThis will not really be the case on the average scenario of the price being included into the block via Flashbots, as it will precisely incentivise as fast as possible inclusion, but it is a consideration to not configure the fallback delay too tigh, avoiding any type of censorship attack, even if very theoretical.\n\nConsidering the previous rationale, and also using historical analysis from Chainlink showing that there will be no loss on the risk profile of the protocol, the recommendation is to set the fallback delay on BTC/USD, AAVE/USD and LINK/USD to 5 blocks.\nThe Aave DAO via its risk provider will reserve executive power over modifying this parameter by communicating to Chainlink.\n\n## Extra protection: SvrOracleSteward\nGiven the criticality of the infrastructure activation, and to be even extra cautious, we also propose to include a new steward smart contract: the SvrOracleSteward.\n\nThe SvrOracleSteward allows for the Aave Protocol Guardian to replace, on the Aave Oracle side, a feed (e.g. CAPO) consuming one the new SVR by exclusively one used before the SVR replacement. This way, even in the very unexpected worst-case scenario of the new SVR simply not being functional or having a really major issue, the Aave Protocol Guardian could immediately swap back to the standard price feeds currently used in production.\n\nWe don’t expect this mechanism to be used anyhow, but we think it is reasonable as an extra line of defense when enabling a pretty innovative system like SVR v1 Chainlink.\n\n## OEV-recaptured recipient\nWhen using systems like Flashbots for a case like this of SVR, it is necessary to define an address to receive the native currency (e.g. ETH) recapture. Ideally, the Aave DAO would have full control over this address, but in practice, as the Chainlink DON is the entity factually building the transaction and submitting it to Flashbots, they have control over configuring it or changing it.\n\nThe Aave protocol already has a RevenueSplitter smart contract to be used as OEV beneficiary, for any non-100%/0% split between Aave and Chainlink. But given that using it or not is a purely operational consideration (as still Chainlink can change it unilaterally), we will coordinate with them to decide whats the most reasonable venue.\n\nIn any scenario, the final recipient of the OEV fees should be the Aave Collector, and we consider mandatory that distribution to it happens minimum once a week, no matter if via RevenueSplitter or via transfer from the Chainlink side.\n\n## Aave/Chainlink fee split terms\n\nSimilar to any other terms of the Aave <> Chainlink SVR partnership, it is outside of the scope of this ARFC to define the percentage of a split between Aave and Chainlink on the OEV recapture, as we (BGD) are technical service providers, and the community should vote on the configuration separately from those.\nWe will abide by any decision approved by the DAO via ARFC, configuring any technical component accordingly.",
