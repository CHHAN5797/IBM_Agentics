Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.\n\nWith market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.\n\nDo note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.\n\n| Asset | Current RF| Recommended RF | \n| ---  | ---    |---     |\n| 1INCH| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| AMPL | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BUSD | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BAL  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| BAT  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CRV  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CVX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| DAI  | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| DPI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENS  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENJ  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FEI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FRAX | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| GUSD | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| KNC  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| LINK | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| LUSD | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| MANA | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| MKR  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| RAI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| REN  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| renFIL| 35.00%| 99.99% |\n| SNX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| sUSD | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| SUSHI| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| TUSD | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| UNI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| USDC | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| USDP | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| USDT | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| UST  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| wBTC | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| wETH | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| YFI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ZRX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n4) Subsequent AIP submission are expected to follow every 14 days thereafter\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

User's funds are not at risk of liquidation and the borrowing rate remains unchanged. \n\nBy progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on v2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to v3.\n\nOf the assets that are currently frozen, with the exception of BAL, the RF is to be increaed to 99.99%. Around $680k of users positions, CRV, DPI, GHST and LINK will receive near zero deposit yield. This represents less than 0.5% of Aave v2's TVL. The highest deposit yield of these assets at the time of writing is 0.21%. This change will have minimal affect. \n\nThe remaining assets are to receive an incremental 5% increase in the RF. After implementing this publication, user elasticity shall be assessed and the impact of the updates before moving forward with additional increases. \n\nThere shall be a minimum gap of 2 weeks between each subsequent update. Target AIP submission date is week commencing 31st July, ain 3 weeks time.  \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated:\n\n|Asset|Current RF |Proposed RF |\n|---|---|---|\n|DAI|21.00%|26.00%|\n|USDC|23.00%|28.00%|\n|USDT|22.00%|27.00%|\n|wBTC|55.00%|60.00%|\n|wETH|45.00%|50.00%|\n|MATIC|41.00%|46.00%|\n|BAL|32.00%|37.00%|\n|CRV|38.00%|99.99%|\n|GHST|60.00%|99.99%|\n|LINK|50.00%|99.99%|\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2) If consensus is reached, submit the first Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n3) Subsequent increments will be done directly through an AIP to reduce the governance overhead.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe author, TokenLogic, receives payment indirectly from [Aave Grant DAO](https://twitter.com/AaveGrants) via [Butter](https://twitter.com/butterymoney) as part of the [Incentivised Delegate Campaign](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732).

As part of this project, Gauntlet seeks to distribute ARB rewards across Aave v3 on Arbitrum to encourage migration from USDC.e to USDC.\n\nThere is currently 15.59M units of USDC.e deposited on Arbitrum v3 that Gauntlet & the Arbitrum Foundation intend to attract to USDC with the use of ARB rewards.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe `EmissionManager`, a governance controlled function, assigns the `Emission_Admin` role for a specified token, ARB on the Arbitrum network. \n\nThe `Emission_Admin` role controls the distribution of the specified token, ARB, across the specified Aave v3 deployment.\n\nThe `Emission_Admin` can distribute ARB anywhere across the Aave v3 Arbitrum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Implementation\n\nSet `Emission_Admin` permission for ARB to the following Gauntlet address: \n\n**Aave v3 Arbitrum**\nAddress Reward (ARB): `0x912CE59144191C1204E64559FE8253a0e49E6548`\nEMISSION_ADMIN: `0xE79C65a313a1f4Ca5D1d15414E0c515056dA90b4`\n\nThe AIP call setEmissionAdmin() method in the emission_manager contract.\n\nEMISSION_MANAGER.setEmissionAdmin(ARB,EMISSION_ADMIN);\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community and risk service providers.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future recommendations and cases of significant market changes.\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing SNX as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1.

The user's current health score is 2.73.\n\n\n### MKR\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum set at $8.5M, has reached 99% utilization.\n\nGiven current market conditions our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling to $12M.\n\nThere are currently four major users using MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum, utilizing 87.5% of the debt ceiling.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal for a series of Reserve Factor (RF) increases across all V2 Ethereum assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our [V2 to V3 migration plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636), we propose a series of RF increases on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\nBy progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on V2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to V3.\n\nThis proposal intends to incrementally increase the reserve factors by 5% at each step. After implementing each increment, we'll assess user elasticity and the impact of the updates before moving forward with additional increases. We will ensure a minimum gap of 2 weeks between each subsequent update.\n\n*Please note that a separate proposal will be made for frozen assets on V2.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Current RF | Recommended RF |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DAI | 10% | 15% |\n| FRAX | 20% | 25% |\n| GUSD | 10% | 15% |\n| LUSD | 10% | 15% |\n| sUSD | 20% | 25% |\n| TUSD | 20% | 25% |\n| USDC | 10% | 15% |\n| USDP | 10% | 15% |\n| USDT | 10% | 15% |\n| 1INCH | 20% | 25% |\n| CRV | 20% | 25% |\n| ENS | 20% | 25% |\n| LINK | 20% | 25% |\n| MKR | 20% | 25% |\n| SNX | 35% | 40% |\n| UNI | 20% | 25% |\n| WBTC | 20% | 25% |\n| ETH | 15% | 20% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit the first Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n3. Subsequent increments will be done directly through an AIP to reduce the governance overhead.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
