        "body": "[TEMP CHECK] Add FBTC to Aave v3 Main Instance on Ethereum\nAuthor: @ACI\nDate: 2024-11-01\n\nSummary\nThe proposal aims to onboard Ignition’s FBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol Main Market on Ethereum.\n\nMotivation\nFBTC is a cross-chain BTC protocol that uses the Threshold Signature Scheme network to enable secure, decentralized Bitcoin scalability across multiple blockchains. By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks. Aave stands to gain significantly as a primary partner in this expansion, following the successful playbook of cbBTC, which quickly scaled through similar collaborative efforts.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: 0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364\n\nChainlink oracle: upcoming\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: Bitcoin Reserve Address | FBTC\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: FBTC proof of assets dashboard\n\nGitHub: GitHub - fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: fbtc-contract/audits at main · fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract · GitHub\n\nTwitter: x.com\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\nDisclosure\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublish a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-11-01\n\n---\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nTable 1 shows a large variation in terms of historical friendly fork proposals. We propose that terms for friendly forks are formalised to ensure fair and transparent treatment of teams wishing to make use of licensed Aave instances in the future.\n\n**Table 1** - Licensed instances and benefits to Aave\n\n| **Partner** | **Profit share for Aave** | **Token supply to Aave** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| WLFi | 20% | 7% |\n| Spark | 10% | None |\n| Superlend | 15% of quarterly revenues over $200k | Unconfirmed amount of tokens airdropped to stkAAVE holders |\n| Zerolend | 10% for first year | 1% to stkAAVE holders |\n| RealT | 20% | None |\n| Reental | 20% | None |\n\nIt should be noted in the above that two particularly strategic outliers are present in WLFi and Spark. Spark represented a significant revenue opportunity for Aave DAO, with $2m per year projected revenue at the time of proposal. This could go some way to explaining the profit share being at the lower bound of previous forks. With WLFi, the terms are at the higher end of the range, although it should be noted that this is not an entirely separate fork of Aave and will make use of Aave liquidity, and tokens will in part be distributed as rewards to users.\n\nTwo other outliers representing not as good value for Aave DAO are the Zerolend, and Superlend forks. It should be noted that the Zerolend proposal was rejected by governance for being too low a profit share. With Zerolend there was a time limit on the profit share terms, meaning that Aave DAO will cease to benefit from any success of Zerolend after the first year. Superlend introduced a minimum revenue value before profit share kicks in, this means the team deploying the fork will profit before Aave DAO does, despite Aave DAO facilitating this through use of the protocol code. Both of these forks also proposed token airdrops to stkAAVE holders, however no tokens directly to the DAO treasury. It is our belief that the DAO should decide how to distribute tokens within the Aave ecosystem and not the teams proposing forks.\n\nIn our view there are two distinct scenarios which must be considered when discussing friendly forks:\n\n1. **Friendly Fork:** Entirely separate deployment, making no use of existing Aave instance liquidity. This may often be on a smaller EVM blockchain or L2 which Aave is not currently deployed on.\n\n2. **Whitelabel Instance:** deployment which makes use of existing Aave instance liquidity as facilitated by Aave 3.2, for example WLFi.\n\nWe believe it is reasonable to expect whitelabel solutions making use of existing Aave liquidity to agree to a higher profit share and token payment to Aave DAO as there are significant benefits associated with this arrangement. It is also possible for tokens provided to the DAO to be deployed as incentives on the main instance in a mutually beneficial manner. On the other hand, teams which handle the deployment themselves, and attract their own liquidity to their fork could be expected to pay a lower profit share given the reduced role of Aave DAO in providing liquidity and other services. This proposal intends to set baseline terms for both of these scenarios which can be referred to by those proposing licensed instances as well as Aave governance when licensed instances are proposed in the future.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt the following two scenarios are proposed:\n\n**Friendly Fork:** \n\n- No Aave DAO involvement beyond licensing Aave code base.\n\n**Whitelabel Instance:**\n\n- Makes use of existing Aave liquidity.\n- Aave DAO will make an effort but makes no guarantees to use DAO owned tokens to participate in governance through the Aave Protocol Embassy.\n- Aave DAO and Service Providers will handle deployment.\n\nIt is proposed that the following terms be set as the baseline for Friendly Forks and Whitelabel Instances of Aave in the future:\n\n*Scenario 1: Friendly Fork*\n\n| **Profit share for Aave** | **Token supply to Aave DAO** |\n| --- | --- |\n| 10% distributed monthly | 3.5% of Total Supply at time of TGE or before deployment if TGE already occurred, if the token is rebasing or inflates in the future, Aave DAO will receive additional tokens so as not to be diluted. |\n\n*Scenario 2: Whitelabel Instance*\n\n| **Profit share for Aave** | **Token supply to Aave DAO** |\n| --- | --- |\n| 20% distributed monthly | 7% of Total Supply at time of TGE or before deployment if TGE already occurred, if the token is rebasing or inflates in the future, Aave DAO will receive additional tokens so as not to be diluted. |\n\nIn addition we propose the following for both scenarios:\n\n- Tokens are to be provided to Aave DAO treasury which can then decide on their distribution through governance.\n- No time limits on profit share.\n- No minimum revenue hurdle before profit share kicks in.\n\nIf deployment of an instance holds outsized strategic or financial advantages to Aave DAO, it is possible for these terms to be deviated from with governance approval. However, it would be expected that the proposing entity provides a strong argument for why deviation should occur.\n\nNo onchain actions are required for this proposal so if ARFC Snapshot passes this will become canon.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot passes, this community preference becomes canon and risk service providers incorporate this into current and future recommendations.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.\n\nCreating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.  \n\nosGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism). If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.\n\nosETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nPotential POL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nosGNO announcement post: https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\n\nosGNO Vaults: https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeWise and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and some ACI team members are holders of GNO.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 13/09/2024\n\n# Summary\n\n[Superlend](https://www.superlend.xyz/) is building a lending and borrowing aggregator platform that allows users to manage their positions across multiple chains and protocols, always accessing the best APRs for lending and the lowest rates for borrowing. The Superlend project was Initially conceived during the [Etherlink Accelerator in Singapore](https://medium.com/etherlink/the-future-of-defi-insights-from-dca-in-singapore-d543477cdbe6) as a lending and borrowing platform on [Etherlink](https://www.etherlink.com/).\n\nSuperlend's goals include launching their own dedicated money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, while also integrating Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem, such as on Ethereum, Base, and Polygon, into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they are planning to deploy an instance of Aave V3 that will exclusively support ETH and ETH-correlated assets (such as LRTs and LSTs), similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. These deployments and integrations will enable users to seamlessly manage their positions within the robust and secure Aave framework, while also allowing Superlend to offer innovative cross-chain liquidity management features. Additional details for the Arbitrum proposal will be provided in the future as they finalize the risk parameters and asset selection. Leveraging Aave's well-audited and secure infrastructure allows them to accelerate their development without compromising on security, avoiding the complexities and costs associated with building from scratch.\n\nIn recognition of the value provided by the Aave community, Superlend proposes a revenue-sharing model, committing to share 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave V3 codebase has established itself as a cornerstone in the DeFi ecosystem, renowned for its reliability, security, and quality. Successful projects like the Spark Protocol and RealT further affirm Aave's technology and reputation. Superlend's objectives are twofold: launching their own innovative money markets using the Aave V3 codebase on Etherlink and Arbitrum, and integrating the various Aave V3 markets already deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (such as those on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to deploy an instance of Aave V3 focused exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to the Lido instance that Aave has deployed on Ethereum. By doing so, they aim to provide users with a cohesive experience that leverages the strength of Aave's framework while also showcasing the unique features and innovations that Superlend can bring to the market.\n\nOne of Superlend's other motivations for deploying on Etherlink and Arbitrum-like chains using the Aave V3 codebase is to enable a feature for their aggregator that allows users to keep their USDC in the best APY protocol across chains with a single click. After extensive testing with the LayerZero-like cross-chain protocol Across+, as well as flash-loan scripts, they discovered that integrating an Aave deployment with the Portal feature activated, along with a third-party bridge provider, could allow users to move their USDC positions from Compound on Arbitrum to Aave on Optimism seamlessly. In this scenario, Superlend markets can serve as a \"temporary station\" where liquidity is parked for a few seconds during the transfer. Before making such a feature live, they would, of course, share it first in the forum and seek feedback when it's ready.\n\nSuperlend's vision aligns with deploying \"friendly\" forks of Aave V3, customized for specific use cases and ecosystems, and integrating these Aave V3 deployments by the Aave DAO as a prominent part of their aggregator. Keeping the open-source ethos at the forefront, they believe it is fair and respectful to seek the Aave community's approval first, ensuring a mutually beneficial path forward for both Aave and Superlend.\n\nAs Aave continues to explore areas like off-chain collateral and new developments such as GHO, projects like Superlend have the opportunity to add value and drive the adoption of Aave's technology. Their proposal to deploy an Aave V3 fork on Etherlink and Arbitrum represents a strategic opportunity to extend Aave's influence within the rapidly evolving cross-chain DeFi landscape. In appreciation of this opportunity, they propose a revenue-sharing model to ensure mutual benefit from this collaboration.\n\nSuperlend has confirmed plans to allocate a portion of its community token supply towards a potential airdrop or distribution specifically for stkAAVE holders, and they wish to leverage the existing set of holders and delegates, aligning with AAVE DAO's governance model. Specific details will be announced closer to the event. Currently, Superlend's priority remains product development and refinement.\n\n# Specification\n\n### Market Deployment\n\n- **Aave V3 Codebase:** Superlend will deploy their money markets on Etherlink and Arbitrum using the Aave V3 codebase. For the Arbitrum deployment, they plan to focus exclusively on ETH and ETH-correlated assets, similar to Aave's Lido instance on Ethereum. Additionally, there could be a second market on Arbitrum dedicated to USDC or similar assets to support their cross-chain liquidity management feature, which would use the Aave Portal feature. These markets will operate independently from their aggregator platform but will be fully integrated within the Superlend ecosystem. These deployments are integral to both their goal of launching innovative Superlend markets and their broader strategy to integrate the existing Aave V3 markets deployed by the Aave DAO across the EVM ecosystem (e.g., on Ethereum and Polygon) into their aggregator.\n    - Test their proposed deployment that they have live on Etherlink testnet [here](https://testnet.superlend.xyz/).\n    - Find the addresses of their deployed contracts on the testnet [here](https://www.notion.so/Testnet-deploy-sequence-addresses-fd6c3707ece94aabab61d8498a638775?pvs=21).\n- **Revenue Sharing:** Superlend proposes sharing 15% of the revenue generated from these markets with the Aave DAO, provided that their quarterly revenue exceeds $200,000. These contributions will be made on a quarterly basis.\n\n### Governance and Risk Management\n\n- **Governance Model:** Initially, the markets will be governed through a 5/8 multi-sig model. As the project matures, they plan to transition to a more decentralized governance structure, aligning with the principles of Aave's governance model.\n- **Risk Management:** Superlend has partnered with [ChainRisk](https://www.chainrisk.xyz/) for continuous risk parameter tuning and will onboard additional partners as needed to ensure comprehensive risk management for these markets.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on the ARFC, escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is favorable, Superlend markets will be deployed on Etherlink and Arbitrum, adhering to the revenue-sharing and governance commitments outlined.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n**title: [ARFC] KNC onboarding on AaveV3 Ethereum market**\n\n**author: Alice Rozengarden @Alice - Aave-chan initiative** \n\n**date: 2023-10-02**\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThis ARFC is proposing to add the KNC token from Kyberswap to the AaveV3 Ethereum market in isolation mode.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nKyberSwap is a multi-chain DEX aggregator + concentrated liquidity platform, that aims to offer superior rates for traders and capital-efficient returns for liquidity providers.\n\nAs one of the oldest and most popular DEX aggregators with an average of 500K web visitors per month. KyberSwap has already been deployed on 14 chains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and Base. Total trading volume has crossed $21B+ and the current total value locked (TVL) on all chains is $60M+.\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token and an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on proposals to improve KyberSwap. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap and other ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols are added, more rewards are generated.\n\nAdding support for KNC on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow KNC holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their KNC position, attracting new KNC deposits, which would add a new revenue stream for Aave while limiting the exposure.\n\n# Specification:\n\nWe propose the following parameters according to [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-knc-to-ethereum-aave-v3/14824/6?u=alice) and [ChaosLabs's recommendations](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-knc-to-ethereum-aave-v3/14824/6#overview-1):\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (KNC) | 1.200.000 |\n| Borrow Cap (KNC) | 650,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |\n| LTV | 35.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10.00% |\n| Liquidation protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 9.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Stable Slope1 | 13.00% |\n| Stable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset | 3.00% |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00% |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n- **Ticker:** KNC\n- **Contract Address:** [0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202)\n- **Chainlink Oracle:** [0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8ff43e991a81e6ec886a3d281a2c6cc19ae70fc)\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.\n\nThe author isn’t compensated by KyberSwap for this ARFC.\n\n# Next step:\n\nThe following steps are as follow:\n\n- gather community feedback and @Gauntlet recommendations on this ARFC.\n- Publish a snapshot of the risk providers' recommendations.\n- If said snapshot is successful, escalate to an AIP.\n\n# Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
