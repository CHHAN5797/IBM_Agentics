Our key success metrics are showcased by fast response times to partner requests and successful execution of many initiatives like supporting the launch of CoWAMM, the related incentive program, or the design and execution of token grants. Furthermore, we are constantly improving our technology stack with the ultimate goal of achieving self-service autonomy for most operations.\n\nGiven the Maxis are an integral part of Balancer technology and partner management, we aim to switch to bi-annual funding starting in Q4 2024. This provides us with more funding stability and also guarantees that resources for the upcoming Balancer v3 launch will be adequately allocated.\n\n# Initiatives\n\nAs with previous funding proposals, we want to make the most impact to Balancer DAO by working on key initiatives with clearly measurable objectives.\n\nAs context, you can refer to our last quarters performance reports to evaluate our progress in relation to initiatives executed in Q3 2024 ([July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-july-2024/5907), [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-august-2024/5979), reports)\n\n## Initiative 1: Scale Balancer’s On-Chain DevOps Hub\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver the last 6 months, we have taken over responsibility over most of the on-chain operations tech stack, including multi-sig management, OpenZepellin infrastructure to distribute BAL rewards, secondary incentive management as well as new chain deployments and access management.\n\nOur main focus for the next half year is to simplify and further automate any on-chain operations that the DAO has to manage. These include but are not limited to new AMM management (e.g. CoWAMMs), Balancer v3 and its corresponding new fee sweeping mechanism as well as governance operations. Two components will be crucial to drive this initiative forward: our [automation code base](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis) and our [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/).\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Operate and maintain new chain deployments for Balancer v2\n\n* Support custom infrastructure for the Balancer v2 MODE deployment incl. a dedicated MODE ve8020 gauge system on MODE network.\n* Support and integrate potential new chain deployments into our operations infrastructure such as BAL token emission scheduling through OpenZeppelin\n* Deploy and maintain any needed infrastructure to operate those chains\n\n2. Fee processing for Balancer v2\n\n* Coordinate and run fee processing of Balancer v2’s core pool framework as long as it is operational in light of the v3 launch\n* Coordinate with Mimic fee processing\n\n3. Secondary Token reward management\n\n* Build a rewards management system on Mode as part of a veMODE initiative\n* Launch a injector configuration tool on the operations UI to further improve partner management and self-service capabilities\n\n4. AURA position management\n\n* Launch a safe module to automatically relock AURA\n* Maintain the self-service module for vote placement for the BD team and design potential automation work to assign incentives without human intervention.\n\n5.

Management and Execution of Token Grants\n\n* Maintaining and provisioning of upcoming token distribution grants\n* Advising on how to design and execute token grant programs\n\n7. Omni-chain operations: Chainlink Automation & Gas Stations\n\n* Further optimize Chainlink upkeep monitoring and automate LINK top-ups as well as the design and development of backup systems\n* Incorporate more monitoring solutions into the [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/chainlink-automation)\n* Establish omni-chain gas station contracts to feed all relevant dependencies with ETH (or chain gas tokens) and LINK (gas for automation jobs)\n* Collaborate with Chainlink to define and ship client-side cross-chain rate providers as well as advising on oracles for omni-chain operations.\n\n8. Analytics (v2)\n\n* Transition to maintenance mode for DeFilytica deployments\n\n9. Financial reporting (v2 & v3)\n\n* Advise on financial reporting metrics with karpatkey\n* Build and ship artifacts to monitor revenue generation on Balancer v3\n\n10. Operations UI\n\n* Full GitHub integration to propose changes from the UI\n* Completion of security review with Hypernative\n* Exploration of token whitelisting module\n* Building of tooling surrounding Balancer v2 and v3 management such as monitoring dashboards for Chainlink, Injector v2 configurator or the migration of legacy pool creators for Balancer v2\n\n## Initiative 2: Support and execute on the launch of Balancer v3 and new Products\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus, Tritium\n\n**Team**: Zen Dragon, gosuto, MikeB\n\n**Summary**\n\nBalancer v3 is planned to release between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. The Maxis will play a crucial role in setting up key infrastructure that guarantees correct operations of the new protocol version across chains. We will collaborate with BLabs and other ecosystem partners to plan and execute a smooth launch which will include a rollout to a defined set of target chains and the subsequent management thereafter. Additionally, we will explore new revenue models and tokenomics adjustments that will have the most beneficial impact on both partners and the DAO.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1.

Over the last 6 months we have always been handling the discretionary portion very conservatively. In the last quarter, we only utilized approximately half of the $60k in allocated funds for Q3 2024. We will roll over ***savings from this cost point of more than $25k USDC*** and deduct them from this proposal.\n\nFurthermore, we improved our cost basis per FTE, all while we increased our headcount and capacity for the anticipated higher demand for Balancers v3 launch. Our average costs came down from an average of $13,484 $ / FTE to $13,212.50 $ / FTE (incl. BAL vests) compared to Q3 2024.\n\nA detailed breakdown of our proposed costs is visualized below:\n\n![|624x320](upload://m8DK7A5w9Ai4IkfttRSTMtu56Bs.png)\n\nWe are additionally asking for a BAL token grant of 32,738 BAL for the next half-year (at BAL price of $1.89). BAL will be locked for 1 year either as veBAL or in a veBAL wrapper such as auraBAL.\n\nQuarterly BAL allocation: $30,937.50 ( = 16,369 BAL)\n\nIn total our USDC and BAL cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 5 FTE:\n\n|Position|Cost Basis|\n| --- | --- |\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC + BAL vest)|$13,212.50|\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC)|$11,150|\n|$ / Freelance FTE / month (USDC)|$9,600|\n\n**Length of engagement: 6 months**\n\n**Budget: 398,135 USDC and 32,738 BAL**\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n**Impact on the Treasury**\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold 3,507,473 BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for the next half year would impact 0.93% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 1.87% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 5.727mln in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 6.95% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 13.9%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `398135` USDC as `398135000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `32738` as `32738000000000000000000`.",

Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n6. Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n7. Balancer v3 documentation\n\n* Support in finalizing and further improving core components of documentation repository for v3\n\n8. UI Beta Testing and Support\n\n**Objectives for Growth Initiatives**\n\nPartner Onboarding Experience\n\n*  Provide an in-depth and comprehensive partner onboarding documentation for both Balancer v2 and Balancer v3 tech\n* Provide guides and content for the official documentation on how to integrate with Balancer as a partner\n* Advise partners on liquidity provisioning and assist in onboarding and any on-chain executions necessary.\n3. Onboard new liquidity on new chain deployments\n4. Assist in establishing new product launches such as the potential CoWAMM product.\n\nFinally, the Maxis team is committed to ensuring efficient on-chain operations for the Balancer DAO. We manage governance-related change control processes, oversee DevOps and multisig automation, and provide infrastructure guidance. Our responsibilities include automating on-chain tasks with OZ Defender and Chainlink Automation, developing smart contracts and tooling, supporting technical best practices, processing bi-weekly fees, and managing grant programs and incentive distributions. These efforts ensure smooth and reliable operations within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview:** Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers:** Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards**: YES\n\n### Domains of Operation\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\nKey Objectives per Operational Discipline:\n\n**1.

We will continue operating in a similar manner as in Q2, anticipating increased demand for automation work and partner support due to new product launches.\n\nOur spending will be closely monitored, with clear insights provided in our monthly reports, as demonstrated in Q2 2024. We believe this setup will significantly aid Balancer DAO in achieving its goals of becoming the hub for LRT, LST, and LRT liquidity.\n\nOverall, people costs in USDC terms will remain consistent with [previous quarters](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-568-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2024/5625). The Maxis will receive part of their compensation in locked BAL, vesting over one year. With an average of 56% of compensation taken as locked BAL, this demonstrates our strong commitment and alignment with the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Length of engagement: 3 months**\n**Budget: 172’500 USDC and 14’464 BAL**\n\n### Cost Breakdown\n\n|Position|Cost per month|\n| --- | --- |\n|People Cost (USDC), 4.7 FTE|46’500 USDC|\n|People Cost, 4.7 FTE (BAL, with 1.25 multiplier) - Locked for 1 year|4’821 BAL|\n|Discretionary Budget to fund freelancers (2 FTE) and infrastructure cost (USDC)|20’000 USDC|\n\nFor Q3 the Maxis have decreased the ask for locked BAL resulting in a decrease of ask in the budget by 24'000 USD while also saving 27'000 USDC in Q2 from the discretionary budget which rolls over to Q3. This results in total savings of 51’000 USD compared to Q2.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325\n\n#### Impact on the Treasury\n\n**The Treasury wallets currently hold ~3.95M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 2024 would cost around 0.37% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.46% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.43M in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3.18% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to ~12.7%.**\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount 172’500 USDC as `172500000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount 14’464 as `14464000000000000000000`.",

Balancer has pivoted as one of the main liquidity hubs for LRTs and LSTs. The Maxis have played a crucial role in making sure our various partners have a seamless experience while onboarding to Balancer tech.\n\nThis positive momentum, however, has also resulted in an immense increase in workload for Maxis, be it on the operational side or partner management. The group performed exceptionally, although we had changes in our team structure with Shakotan leaving and moving on to work for Radiant Capital.\n\nThe combination of increased responsibility and workload are key factors for us to focus on automating as many internal and on-chain processes as possible while also making the partner experience as seamless as possible - both for Balancer v2 and v3. We took a lot of learnings from Q1 and want to transition to a more professional Dev- and GovOps organization. We will therefore focus our efforts on 2 key initiatives: automation and stellar partner experience for v2 and v3. To achieve these goals we need a balance of retaining the current talented team and having enough flexibility to attract new talent for our various development tasks.\n\nAdditionally, we will undergo some structural modifications to reflect these changes: Danko and the Ballers will transition into the Balancer OpCo (Admin & Ops) for administrative and operations, ecosystem liaison and community mod tasks. This is an ideal opportunity as we further decentralize our SP landscape and strengthen our DAO, while also focusing the teams on what they are good at. Learn more about it on the Foundation’s funding [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-year-three-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/5627).\n\nWe are incredibly excited about the road ahead. Our protocol metrics show amazing performance across the board and we are dedicated to make sure Balancer will continue to be the go-to blue chip AMM in this market cycle!\n\n## Initiatives\n\nIn Q1, we introduced initiatives which helped us focus our efforts to specific work domains. In general, we had great experience with these work packages but will make sure to not overcommit this quarter with too many tasks, as smooth DAO operations are our highest priority. Therefore, we will focus our energy on 2 initiatives resulting in the highest possible impact for the DAO.\n\n### Initiative 1: Transition to a professional DevOps organization with Automation\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\nThe Balancer Maxis have been maintaining and operating key infrastructure in the DAO. These components include the [Fee sweep automation repo](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator), [Reward injectors](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/ChildChainGaugeInjectoooor) and [grant distribution automation](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/STIP_automation). Furthermore, we were assigned the task to maintain and take over the OZ defender infrastructure making sure BAL gets streamed to all Balancer deployments.\n\nWe made significant advancements in Q1 but need to further focus on streamlining all these repositories. A main focus will also be set on migrating the infrastructure we took over from BLabs to a new version as the old one will be deprecated June 1st 2024. We therefore have a clear set of objectives to fulfill and also plan to use freelance resources to complete them.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Fee Sweep Automation:\n* Refactor and improve code base incl. integration tests\n* Provide transparent and meaningful reports so that all DAO participants (investors and partners alike) can understand the mechanisms behind our core pool framework\n* Work together with Mimic or other partners to improve fee sweep performance\n*  Evaluate and improve voting incentive placements\n* Re-evaluate Aura fee recycling\n\n2. vlAURA Voting:\n* Provision automatic voting as outlined in [BIP-508](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419)\n* Make the DAO owned vlAURA position easy to maintain (relocks etc).\n\n3. OZ Defender:\n* Establish a repository in the Balancer Maxis org\n* Implement deployment pipelines with the OZ API for professional CI/CD integration\n* Migrate to OZ Defender v2 and set up the enterprise tier subscription plan. The costs will be covered by Balancer OpCo.\n* Assess and negotiate the usage of a professional subscription to run our operations\n* Implement further monitoring\n* If possible, implement gas usage optimizations\n\n4. RewardsInjector v2\n* Finalize the new design\n* Write integration tests\n* Get a smart contract review\n* Make new contract ready to be used for Q3 latest\n\n5. Gauges and core pools\n* Automatic core pool detection and maintenance\n* Automatic gauge removal flagging\n\n### Initiative 2: Grow Balancer v2 and Support v3 Design\n\n**Lead**: MikeB\n\n**Team**: Maxis\n\n**Summary**\nBalancer v3 is in active development and set to go public with developer documentation and other collateral materials in April. Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It’s crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nAt the same time, we strive to improve the quality of the partner experience for Balancer v2 while also supporting the launch on promising L2 chains with our technical expertise. Balancer v2 will remain a core component of the Balancer ecosystem and we strive to make it as easy to use as possible.\n\n**Objectives for v3 design**:\n\n* Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n* Facilitate Hook Development: Bring innovative hooks to market through developer outreach and incentive alignment.\n* Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings..\n* Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n* Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n* Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n**Objectives for v2 growth:**\n* Improve partner experience supporting the marketing team with a consistent partner onboarding pack and process\n* Improved partner onboarding experience by streamlining internal processes\n* Streamline and simplify gauge on- and offboarding (incl. automatic flagging of deprecated gauges)\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s)**: Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers:** Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** YES\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** YES\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n#### 1.

Data Analytics and Reporting\n* Spearheading data analytics, offering valuable insights through reports and dashboards.\n* Maintaining high-level expertise in protocol-related data.\n* Providing quarterly financial reports\n* Assisting in data handling, contributing to informed decision-making.\n\n#### Length of Engagement & Budget\n\nThe biggest adjustment in the Maxis funding proposal is the allocation of $60k USDC for discretionary budget for the entire quarter. Main reasons are the increased demand in resources to conclude tasks as described in the automation initiative like smart contract reviews, resource allocation for the OZ defender integration and stabilization of our platform. We will make sure to use these funds as conservatively as possible and will report on the usage in the monthly reports. Overall, people costs in USDC terms will be at par or below the [previous quarters](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420) ($117,000 for Q2) as the Maxis will take part of their compensation in locked BAL vesting for 1 year. The fraction of locked BAL for compensation across contributors is 56% on average.\n\nWe have furthermore deducted following savings from this quarterly funding proposal:\n* 11,880 USDC\n* 800 BAL\n\n**Length of engagement:** 3 months\n\n**Budget:** `165,120 USDC` and `18,625 BAL`\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n#### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold ~4.2M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q2 2024 would cost around 0.4% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.74% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.78M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.86% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~11.43%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nShakotan with address `0x8053484489b110181a6dba0b59dda887e433f470` will be offboarded from all relevant multi-sig safes and be replaced by gosuto.eth `0x11761c7b08287d9489CD84C04DF6852F5C07107b` (can be verified [here](http://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/541d1f22cc498623880e219011c4cc24b5208caf/extras/signers.json#L2)). It is therefore proposed to swap Shakotan for gosuto in the [Balancer Maxi Signer](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/multisig.html#operational-multisigs-signer-set-aka-balancer-maxis) set. This grants signership to a number of 3/6 multisigs.

Recognized as key contributors and the vital link between partners and the protocol, our dedication to the DAO is unwavering. As we embark on another quarter, our commitment is not just to continue, but to evolve – to redefine our engagement and amplify our positive impact on the DAO in 2024.\n\nThe third quarter marked a significant transition for the Maxis. Following the departure of our strategic visionary, Solarcurve, we embraced change and innovation. Tritium rose to the occasion, leading critical initiatives like the [core pool incentive automation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-457-core-pool-incentive-program-automation/5254), as well as securing and executing on the Arbitrum STIP, demonstrating our adaptability and resilience.\n\nOur evolution goes beyond roles and responsibilities. The Maxis are transforming from a collective of passionate enthusiasts to a team of full-time, professional experts. The new full-time addition consists of @Xeonus who will spearhead our strategic direction.\n\nOur mindful approach to funding allocation ensures an efficient use of resources – balancing USDC and BAL demands with maximum effectiveness. Our focus is not just on growth but on impact and transparency.\n\nIn 2024 we want to make the most impact by driving forward exciting initiatives while providing excellent mission-critical services to the DAO. We have identified four main (non-v3 dependent) initiatives to channel our efforts, while continuing to provide the core services that have been the backbone of the DAO for over two years.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nBeyond regular operations, the Maxi’s are focused on trying to create successful narratives in the Balancer ecosystem through various focused initiatives. In 2024, we strive to focus on a few of them, ensure that our focus areas have a clear leader/champion and some defined goals and that time and resources are available to focus on these topics. The impact of those topics is directly related to the achieved objectives.\n\n### Initiative 1: Growth beyond Mainnet\n\nLead: Tritium\n\nTeam: Shakotan (tech and operations), Xenous (data)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Grants Committee, Beethoven (Marketing + Beets grants)\n\nSummary\n\nThe initiative aims to further strengthen the DAO's presence beyond mainnet, focusing on Arbitrum, zkEVM, and Gnosis. The initiative emphasizes the successful execution of the Arbitrum STIP, but most of all development of strong competencies in creating data-driven narrative showcasing Balancer’s competitiveness, and collaboration with key blockchain partners such as Polygon and Aribtrum. The strategy includes adaptability to pivot based on market trends and performance metrics and an ever growing understanding of the KPIs that our grant providing partners care about.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Timely STIP Execution: Ensure punctual and successful delivery of the current STIP, including consistent reporting and active engagement with the DAO.\n2. Data Narrative Development: Work to build a competency within Balancer to tell stories about how we are using our emissions to drive growth for our protocol and in the ecosystems we exist in.\n\n  1. We should be able to put out velodrome style reports that tell our story.\n\n3. KPI-Focused Program Management: Stay close to various grant programs and look at successful grant recipients to understand the KPIs they set and how they achieve them.\n\n  1. Propose changes at Balancer to make this possible or point out why we are not well suited to meet the kinds of KPIs that chain ecosystems see value in.\n\n4. Next Grant Cycle Preparation: Identify potential grant sources for the upcoming cycle and strategize engagement.\n5. Feedback Integration: Actively seek and incorporate feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the initiative.\n6. STIP Comparative Analysis: Collaborate with the STIP body to assess and report on Balancer's performance in comparison to peers.\n7. Impact Report Creation: Develop a comprehensive report detailing the impact of extra incentives delivered through balancer on L2 ecosystems.\n8. Strategic Partnerships: Strengthen collaborations with Gnosis Chain, Base, Arbitrum and Polygon to share successes and apply learnings, particularly in the context of zkEVM scaling.\n9. Collaborate with Beets as much as possible to create a shared competency here.\n\n### Initiative 2: Redesign of the Gauge Framework v1\n\nLead: Xeonus\n\nTeam: Shakotan (building automation), Tritium, Zekraken, Zen Dragon and Mike B (design)\n\nSummary\n\nThis initiative aims to introduce an automated, dynamic system for evaluating and adjusting gauge emissions based on performance metrics. This new framework is designed to efficiently allocate BAL rewards, optimizing support for both high-cap and emerging projects. The goal is to ensure a more responsive and adaptable system that balances revenue optimization with nurturing potential future revenue generators.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Automated Gauge Evaluation: Develop a system for automatic assessment of gauges based on predefined metrics.\n2. Dynamic Emission Cap Adjustments: Implement a mechanism to adjust emission caps (ranging from 2% to 10%) based on gauge performance, potentially reducing underperforming gauges to a certain cap (e.g. 0.5%).\n3. Adaptive Framework: Ensure the framework is responsive to market dynamics and capital efficiency, allowing for more flexible and efficient allocation of BAL rewards.\n4. Rules around Duplication: Rules for handling the same Token in multiple pools/chains or the same DAO with multiple tokens.\n\n### Initiative 3: Support Balancer v3 Design\n\nLead: Mike B\n\nTeam: Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Tritium, Shakotan(tech and automation)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs, Beethoven (Tech)\n\nSummary: Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It's crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n2. Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings like TWAMMs, boosted pools, and dynamic ECLPs, and effectively pitch these to ecosystem projects.\n3. Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n4. Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n5. Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n### Initiative 4: Automation ownership transfer & on-chain automation improvements\n\nLead: Shakotan\n\nTeam: Tritium\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs\n\nSummary:\n\nOngoing automation for both on-chain and off-chain processes. Improving existing operational contracts, such as Gauge injector and improving Defender codebase so it becomes maintainable.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. OZ Defender automation takeover from Balancer Labs and Markus\n2. Full tech and development for on-chain tasks\n3. ChildGaugeInjector version 2 release with new features + factory deployment to support better events and data used by Data Team\n4. Potential fees-handler-sc implementation to reduce rugability of the fees bags + improve data flow.\n\nService Provider Name & Overview: Balancer Maxis\n\nLeader(s): Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Danko, Tritium, Shakotan and Gosuto\n\nContributors (a.k.a.

Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q1 2024 would cost around 0.9% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.3M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.5% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~10%.\n\nFurthermore, this table provides an overview of the last years impact putting this proposal into perspective:\n\n|Year|Quarter|BAL|BAL Price|USDC|ETH|ETH price|Operations cost|People cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|2023|Q1|48000|$6|$0.00|0|1201|0|$266,400|$266,400.00|\n|2023|Q2|42150|$7|$0.00|5|1795|8975|$291,257|$300,231.50|\n|2023|Q3|26025|$5|$132,630.00|20|1853|37060|$251,825|$288,884.50|\n|2023|Q4|31695|$3|$168,770.00|20|1652|33040|$271,779|$304,819|\n|2024|Q1|35718|$4|$108,095.00|20|2170|43400|$250,969|$294,369|\n\nAlthough the Maxis will have around 1 FTE more manpower at their disposal, the impact on the treasury stays nearly the same. Maxis have undergone internal optimizations in pay to reduce the impact on the DAOs USDC as much as possible given the current market conditions.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/307\n\n### Introduction\n\nThere are some significant changes compared to the last funding proposal and I welcome community feedback as always.\n\nNow that the treasury has a healthier supply of stablecoins and the DAO’s ongoing stablecoin costs look to be significantly lower in Year 2 I think it’s prudent to start paying the liquid portion of salaries in USDC. Thus the breakdown below will look a bit different from last quarter.\n\nWe’ll also be discontinuing Coordinape and adopting a bounty board for community contributors (this is based on feedback from the community and contributors themselves). We will share our learnings from our Coordinape experience soon. Previously 5000 BAL per month or $33,750 was allocated towards this, using last quarter’s BAL price of $6.75.\n\n10,000 USDC per month will be allocated toward the community bounty board. This is expected to compensate regular contributors with clear roles like Cosme, Gleb, and Dubstard for their ongoing work while allowing the opportunity for others to also pick up tasks. The Maxis will own the setup and management of this board and also provide a report on the spend in the monthly forum update.\n\nPreviously we requested 8550 BAL per month for salaries or $57,712. For Q3 we request 31,210 in USDC and 8475 in BAL per month or $68,500. The increase is driven by two factors:\n\n* Tritium’s salary is increasing a little over $5k vs last quarter - this better reflects a market salary for his skill set and his growing importance to the various operations of Maxis.\n* To partially make up for the loss of Coordinape each Maxi was given an additional 200 BAL or 1000 USDC (aside from Tritium)\n\nThis does mean each Maxi aside from Tritium is taking an effective pay cut as average Coordinape rewards per person exceeded the above figures. I believe this is prudent given the challenging market conditions where we must be trimming costs as much as we can.\n\n \n![bip-347-1.png](ipfs://bafkreick4g54svav42kw6jnj2ukvpuoc7f6idqjpv77x2fgnzshaqtlh7a)\n    \n\nLast quarter we asked for 1500 BAL for dev bounties. 875 BAL of that was spent, the details of which you can find in the below table. From this the Maxis have decided to pursue a retainer for Shakotan in the amount of 3000 USDC per month and 600 BAL to be max locked for the quarter. He will continue assisting us in our various Github repos to ensure our automated processes work as reliably and accurately as possible.\n\n \n![bip-347-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibj64iwi2uulfx4ml5pbttawvsjxezeficbd5fnjriwttcymik5v4)\n    \n\nFinally, we’ll ask for an additional 20 ETH from the treasury for gas expenses. You can check out [this dashboard](https://dune.com/scoffie/maxigasstation?undefined=) we commissioned to track gas spending. This may require supplemental funding during the quarter depending on ETH gas prices and if gas intensive activities increase, such as poking additional layer zero cross chain rate providers.\n\n----------------------------------------\n**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Solarcurve, joined by the returning cast of Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Danko, and Tritium.\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** Yes\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\nAs Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocol's future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or protecting the interests of the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis have proven to be a key component of Balancer.\n\nOur Q3 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group, and reading on previous [Q2 funding post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-230-fund-the-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2023/4562) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for April, May, and June.\n\n*Multisig Management*\n\n* Linear (boosted) pool settings\n* Swap fee and amplification adjustments\n* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL\n* Adding new reward tokens to gauges\n* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees\n* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig\n* Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig\n\nThese are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist – they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people.\n\n*Governance*\n\n* We act as verifiers of last resort for BIPs that require on-chain execution and we post BIPs ready for a vote on snapshot - though anyone with 200k veBAL can also post to snapshot.\n* Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics\n* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)\n* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process\n* Manage admin of the Governance Forum\n* We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group.\n\n*Automation and Tooling*\n\n* We work with Mimic to sweep and process our collected fees into USDC.\n* We run scripts that collect data and redirect fees to vote markets for veBAL holders to collect with their votes.\n* We build, deploy and fund [[Chainlink Automation Upkeeps](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers)](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers) which handle regular operations for veBAL, and incentive management for our strategic partners.\n* We continue to develop more reporting to help validate and verify submitted multisig payloads.\n* We track and organize governance operations through the transparent and open [Balancer Multisig Operations repository](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops).\n* We build and maintain internal tooling complex and common tasks such as pool creation and linear pool management.These tools are not polished/require some knowledge to operate, but we share them with some support in our bizdev and community support conversations.\n* Members of the Maxis, often supported by external grants, build and maintain analytics for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMaxis spend a good deal of time developing and conducting operational processes to keep fees flowing and governance systems operational and accurate. In 2023 we have started flexing our coding skills more and working to automate governance and partner liquidity management support operations in ways that are more “no-stop” and permissionless when possible.\n\n*Partnerships*\n\n* We manage Balancer’s Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed\n* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions\n* We often deploy new pools for other projects\n* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists\n* We help with UI testing for Balancer\n* Seek out new opportunities to apply Balancer’s technology, primarily in the DeFi realm\n* Manage relationships with partners across the entire lifecycle from initial conversations to implementation to final results\n* Coordinate partner needs with other teams in the Balancer ecosystem, e.g. integrations.\n\nMaxis took the lead on partnerships in the Balancer ecosystem during Q4 2022 after the biz dev team at Orb was dissolved. The primary near term goals are expanding boosted pool offerings focused primarily on Aave v3, encouraging adoption of ve80/20 or similar systems, making Balancer the hub of LST liquidity, and increasing utilization of the veBAL flywheel (projects bribing, parking POL, etc). Generally we believe Balancer has made solid progress over the last few months on these initiatives.\n\n*Community*\n\n* We manage a bounty board, open to community contribution\n* Onboarding framework for new contributors\n* Discord moderation and security\n* First responders to user support\n* Bridging the community inquires to other Service Providers\n\nThis quarter’s proposal represents a big shift from the framework inherited from the Ops subDAO and the Coordinape reward system. Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. However, we have learned that bounties can attract higher quality and project-oriented contributors that might be more likely to be retained. Soon we will share more about our experience using Coordinape.\n\nThis new approach will allow the community’s marketing efforts currently under the Maxis to be handed out to Beethoven’s team plans for [community developments](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810).\n\nThe legacy onboarding program will still be running, reaching every applicant through discovery calls to help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer.\n\n*Project Management*\n\n* Lead weekly meetings with team leads across the ecosystem to align on projects in flight\n* Be the driving force behind the ecosystem’s top roadmap priorities and be accountable for their delivery\n* Track project dependencies across the teams and coordinate among relevant parties\n\nMaxis assumed the role of project management for the ecosystem in Q1. We are well positioned for this as we are the point of contact for outside teams & projects and we have established working relationships with all internal teams. Our experience in executing various initiatives in the last 9 months means we have a lot of insight into what it takes to take a project from start to finish.\n\n*Record Keeping*\n\n* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\n3 months.\n\nBudget of 34,210 USDC per month for salaries and 8,475 BAL per month, plus Shakotan’s 600 BAL for the quarter. We also request an additional monthly allocation of 10,000 USDC per month for the bounty board and a quarterly allocation of 20 ETH for gas expenses.\n\n**Total for 3 month engagement: 132,630 USDC and 26,025 BAL and 20 ETH** (ETH is excluded in the following comparison).\n\n*Comparison against last quarter:* Using today’s BAL price of $4.4 we’re requesting $247,140 this quarter. Last quarter we requested 42,150 BAL at a price of $6.75 or $284,512. Thus this quarter’s funding proposal represents a reduction in costs of $37,372.\n\n**Funds to transfer:** 132,630 USDC and 25,400 BAL and 20 ETH (to reflect the unspent 625 BAL from last quarter’s dev bounties)\n\n*Impact on the Treasury*: The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 would cost around 0.5% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~12%.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325\n\n**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation:** N/A",
