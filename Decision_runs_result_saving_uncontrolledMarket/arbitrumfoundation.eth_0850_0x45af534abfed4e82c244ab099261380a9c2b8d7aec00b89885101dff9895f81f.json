        "body": "Following the initial feedback of LTIPP Council, CVI would like to re-submit its LTIPP application.\nThe full proposal can be found here: \nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/cvi-ltipp-application-final/21947 \n\nRequest: 125,000 $ARB (Reduced from 250,000 $ARB)\n\n### Summary:\nCVI.Finance has revised their LTIPP grant proposal based on comprehensive feedback from the Arbitrum Council. In their commitment to align with Arbitrum's expectations and ecosystem, they significantly reduced their initial grant request by 50% and refined their strategic objectives to enhance trading excellence, market stability, and widespread engagement within the ecosystem.\n### Key Adjustments:\nGrant Size Reduction: From 250,000 $ARB to 125,000 $ARB to address council concerns about the original grant size and ensure responsible allocation of resources.\n\nFocused Objectives:\n\n* Trading Excellence and Activity: Allocating 40,000 $ARB to boost trading via competitions.\n* Liquidity and Market Stability: Enhancing liquidity with a targeted 40,000 $ARB, focusing on a tiered incentive structure adjusted to the current $ARB price. This includes incentives for reaching up to $2M TVL.\n* Trading Engagement: Increasing trading engagement through raffles and rebates totaling 45,000 $ARB.\n### Council Feedback Response:\n* Addressed Wintermute’s concerns on grant justification by halving the request and detailing fund distribution.\n* Integrated GMX’s suggestions for clearer grant size justification and a phased funding approach.\n* Responded to Karel’s feedback by ensuring milestones are based on tangible, proven results.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCVI’s revised proposal aligns closely with Arbitrum’s goals for growth and innovation. By scaling down the request and focusing on key performance metrics, CVI is committed to demonstrating the value and effectiveness of the project within the ecosystem.",

        "body": "Deri Protocol has updated the incentive mechanism and justification based on the council’s feedback, applying only 30% of the originally proposed grant.\n\nLink to Application\nhttps://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/deri-protocol-ltipp-application-final/21566 \n\n### Requested Grant Size:\nUSD equivalent: $230,769\nARB amount: 115,385 ARB at $2\n\n### Justification\nTo determine the size of the grant we should request, we chose to benchmark against the current TVL increases that we’ve seen so far with our DERI incentives program. As detailed below, we expect to see at least a 250% increase in TVL heading to Arbitrum during the lifetime of this grant.\nWe target an average of 20% APR in ARB in our pool. To achieve this level of rewards for LPs on $5M TVL across 12 weeks, it would require the following:\nUSD equivalent = $5M * 20% *12/52 = $230,769\nARB amount = $$230,769/$2=115,385 ARB at $2\n\n\n### Council Feedback: \nGFX Feedback)\nWe are supportive for 30% of the grant spend proposed. The remaining 70%, however, is to rebate users fees paid to the applicant. This is hard to support for several reasons. Firstly, the applicant hasn’t demonstrated that fee waivers worked to increase (and then retain) volume before asking for a large amount of funding. Secondly, rebating fees paid to the applicant, as opposed to gas or third party fees, is equivalent to governance directly giving the applicant funding. Thirdly, when fees are at or approach 100% and also are fees to the applicant, this creates a perverse incentive for the applicant to encourage wash trading, sybil farming, or steering the grant funds to rebate the highest margin trades. We recommend the applicant revise and resubmit in future grants cycles with either a different distribution mechanism or significant guard rails to address the concerns above.\n\nWintermute Feedback)\nhis application was decent and scored well across various criteria. Their execution strategy was clear however, it lacked any form of justification or calculations on how they intend to reach their milestones and KPIs. Incentives for LPs were not benchmarked against market rates and they just targeted arbitrary numbers for TVL and daily trading volume.\nTheir requested grant size is on the large end and is not sufficiently justified, this is further compounded by a lack of daily users.\nLastly, we are not sure if spending 70% of this grant on trading rebates are the best use of DAO funds.\nWe will not be supporting this application.\n\nKarel Feedback)\n    \nVote AGAINST Deri's proposal.\n\nDecent proposal but unable to endorse for following reasons: (i) 70% of grant is set to go to the applicant as a fee rebate vs. end users is outside of LTIPP scope and may lead to misaligned incentives to encourage wash trading/sybiling/etc.; and (ii) insufficient justification on how they will achieve target milestones/KPIs.\n\nConsider resubmitting with just the 30% grant size focused on LP rewards and greater justification on the above.",

We were only able to make strategies that had no exposure to IL, could take large deposits with little slippage, and were essentially lossless. DeFi activity on Arbitrum was booming, but did not align with these prerequisites.\n  * Today we’re in a much better position. We’ve released Vaults V3 that allows us to open up Yearn strategies to a new spectrum of risk. In the past 30 days we’ve released 21 new vaults and strategies, with most of those coming out in the past 7 days.\n  * We’ll ensure creative communications through Yearn twitter and other social channels.\n* No milestones over the 12 weeks\n  * We’ll divide incentives equally over 12 weeks and begin a push for both lending liquidity and yield boosts.\n  * We propose the following milestones with the understanding that we will not receive the next stage of incentives if we do not cross the goal TVL:\n    * Weeks 1-4\n      * Goal: $10 million\n    * Weeks 5-8\n      * Goal: $20 million\n    * Weeks 9-12\n      * Goal: $30 million\n* Lack of net-new in-flows to Arbitrum\n  * We will prevent cannibalization between yield seekers by omitting Stargate, Curve, and Compound strategy boosting directly as these 3 farms exist on Arbitrum today.\n  * We will enable net-new in-flows to Arbitrum through our Superform integration, a hub of L2 to L2 activity for Yearn: [Superform | Earn Yield & Distribute Vaults](https://app.superform.xyz/protocol/yearn/activity/)\n\nWe will focus on net-new strategies to Arbitrum that will grow:\n\n* Pendle Penpie strategies\n* Silo lending liquidity\n  * Since the submission of this original proposal, we’ve engaged Silo to onboard to Juiced Vaults with the goal of net-new in flows to Arbitrum\n* Llama lending liquidity\n  * Since the submission of this original proposal, we’ve planned to onboard to Juiced Vaults for Llama Lend with the goal of net-new in flows to Arbitrum\n* Ajna lending liquidity\n* Gamma LP strategies",

        "body": "Following the initial feedback of LTIPP Council, Tradao would like to re-submit its LTIPP application.\n\nThe full proposal can be found here:\n\n[https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tradao-ltipp-application-final/21884](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tradao-ltipp-application-final/21884)\n\n## Request: 100,000 $ARB (Reduced from 190,000 $ARB)\n\n### Feedback Summary:\n\nThe council feedback could be summarized as:\n\n1. Wintermute: Criticized the large grant request, unverifiable metrics, and lack of anti-sybil measures\n\n2. GMX: Lack of product-market fit and transaction numbers. Found the grant request to be inefficient and the incentive strategies unproven.\n\n3. GFX: Highlighted concerns about the large grant size and the challenge in verifying Tradao's metrics. Recommended revising the application with enhanced sybil protection measures and to consider feedback from multiple reviewers for a future submission.\n\n### Key Metric Update\n\nAs Tradao's permissionless copy trading function launched in early March before the LTIPP application program deadline, the metric of copy trading cannot fully reflect our product-market fit. Here is some update about our metric.\n\nPrevious\n\n* Trading volume: 27,920,792\n* Traded: 828\n* Address: 66\n\nNew\n\n* Trading volume: 70,540,917(Copy Trading) + 11,053,160(Direct Referral)\n* Traded: 2,576\n* Address: 153\n\nSource:\n\n1. https://dune.com/patrick_tradao/tradao-dashboard\n2. https://www.gmxreferrals.com/arbitrum (Search Code: Tradaox)\n\n### Key Adjustment\n\nIn response to feedback from the Council and recent dencun upgrade, we propose resubmitting the application with a reduced grant amount by removing the rebates of GMX's excution fee, eliminating trading competition and wallet generation incentive.\n\nSetting the new grant request at 100K ARB, we will implement the following incentive scheme:\n\n* Increase the total transacted volume via Tradao\n  * Currently at $1.63M daily volume\n  * Targeting ~$3M daily volume\n* Incentivize fee rebate → less cost to trade → more trades → more volume and likely users\n* As Tradao is totally free to every user, we don’t charge any cost from users. This means all the costs are the gas fee and the fee charged by GMX. We will rebate 80% of open fees back to users. To achieve this, at a target of $3M daily volume and 100 daily transactions, across 12 weeks, it would require:\n  * USD equivalent = ($3M * 0.06% * 80%) * 365 * 12/52 = $121.29K\n  * ARB amount = $121.29K / $1.2 = 100K ARB at $1.2\n\n## Expected milestones\n\nInitial unlock 33% of ARB\n\nMilestone 1: 84m Trading Volume (66% of ARB unlocked & 33% of ARB distributed)\n\nMilestone 2: 168m Trading Volume (100% of ARB unlocked & 66% of ARB Distributed)\n\nMilestone 3: 252m Trading Volume (100% of ARB unlocked & 100% of ARB Distributed)\n\nThe Tradao team agrees to return to the Arbitrum DAO any unused ARB funds once the 12-week LTIPP program is concluded.",
