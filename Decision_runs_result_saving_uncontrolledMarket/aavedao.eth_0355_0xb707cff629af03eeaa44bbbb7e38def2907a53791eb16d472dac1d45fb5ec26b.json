        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC]  Retroactive bug bounties proposal (pre-Immunefi)\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nRequest for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi official bug bounty program, amounting a grand total of $86’500.\n\n**The objective of this ARFC is to pre-authorise such payments, to be processed via an on-chain AIP**\n\n## Motivation\n\nBefore the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program on [September 25th 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), security reports by white hats where evaluated in an ad-hoc basis, proposing bounties/rewards following an approach like on [this proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077). That was not optimal, as there was no formal scope defined, or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact.\n\nCurrently, every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program, however, there were other reports submitted via other channel before that (usually security@aave.com). As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness, and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards, we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retro-actively outside the program.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Reports\n\nFirst of all, we want to clarify certain aspects for the community:\n\n- The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did ad-hoc in the past [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077#clarification-on-evaluation-2), as we don’t think it is fair for the white-hats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and out-of-scope rules, as they were defined afterwards.\n- In one of the cases, we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi, in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform. As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat, Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10% of the amount, which we think is legitimate.\n- At the moment, *we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports*, because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now, one has dependencies with another report (not disclosed yet) and the other could increase risk to non-Aave entities.\n\n\n### 1. Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2/v3\n\nWhen calling `borrow()` with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3, one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once.\n\nHowever, `swapBorrowRateMode()` doesn’t validate the same, which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment, with minting of stable rate disabled.\n\n\n**Severity:  Low**\n\nThe issue didn’t create any immediate problem in the protocol, but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected.\n\n**Likelihood:  Certain**\n\nThis problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.\n\n**Proposed bounty:** 10’000 USD\n\n---\n\n### 2. Inconsistent HF (Health Factor) behaviour swap borrow rate mode\n\nWhen swapping borrow rate mode, the HF of an user is not validated, as debt should remain the same. However, under edge scenarios, the HF of an user could slightly change (by ~1 unit of lowest asset’s decimals).\n\n\n**Severity:  No impact**\n\nThis is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario, but it is unexpected behaviour.\n\n**Likelihood:  Certain**\n\nThis problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.\n\n**Proposed bounty:** 5’000 USD\n\n---\n\n### 3. Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave\n\nBy executing a complex strategy (involving compromising the asset’s trusted infrastructure), it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2.\n\nEven if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset, and we don’t consider a bug of the protocol, it was taken into account for off-boarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave, and we believe it is fair to reward retro-actively.\n\nAs this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it, even if we don’t really see any immediate risk, we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it, until the team applies extra measures.\n\n\n**Severity:  Critical**\n\nBeing a price manipulation, the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important.\n\n**Likelihood: Not likely**\n\nThe attack involves compromising asset’s infrastructure (which would directly disqualify on the current Aave <> Immunefi program), together with extra techniques; so we consider it theoretically possible, but highly improbable.\n\n**Proposed bounty:** 65’000 USD. Additionally, 6’500 USD as Immunefi fee.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIf this ARFC is positive, afterwards we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal, releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses.",

After technical preparations and consultations, the following parameter adjustments options are proposed:\n\n**Option A**\n\n| Parameter | Current Parameters | Proposed Parameters |\n|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| Cooldown  | 10 Days            | 15 Days             |\n| Budget    | 30 AAVE/day        | 100 AAVE/day        |\n\n**Option B**\n\n| Parameter | Current Parameters | Proposed Parameters |\n|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| Cooldown  | 10 Days            | 20 Days             |\n| Budget    | 30 AAVE/day        | 50 AAVE/day        |\n\n\nThe proposed changes are intended to optimize the effectiveness of StkGHO in its role within the Safety Module.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Conduct a snapshot vote to confirm the community's agreement with the proposed changes.\n3. Implement the parameter updates in accordance with the snapshot results.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated for creating this proposal and is acting independently on behalf of the Aave community's best interests.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n---",

        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] Further increase GHO Borrow Rate\nauthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative\ncreated: 2023-10-05\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes a further increase in the GHO borrow rate by 50 basis points (bps), raising it from 2.5% to 3%.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave community has previously recognized the importance of adjusting the GHO borrow rate to maintain the stability and health of the protocol. The motivations for this proposal are:\n\n1. **Strengthening the GHO Peg**: The prior adjustment to the GHO borrow rate resulted in a stronger GHO peg. An additional increase is anticipated to further bolster the peg and get closer to the target value.\n2. **Enhancing GHO Revenue**: By increasing the borrow rate, the protocol is expected to generate additional revenue from GHO borrowings.\n3. **Coordinated Effort**: This proposal aligns with other initiatives, including the GHO buy program set of AIPs, as part of a coordinated effort to support the GHO peg.\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\n\nThis proposal also greenlights the ACI for a `direct-to-AIP` process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate. \n\n## Specification\n\n- Asset: GHO  \n- Contract Address: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f  \n- Current Borrow Rate: 2.5%  \n- Proposed Borrow Rate: 3%  \n- New discounted Borrow Rate: ~2.1%\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This will maintain Aave’s position as the prime liquidity protocol by increasing our protocol attractiveness for users looking to maximize their capital efficiency.\n\n# Specification\n\n**stETH E-Mode Ethereum**\n\nUpdate ETH-correlated E-Mode parameters with the following values.\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 90% | 93% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93% | 95% |\n\nWe propose no changes to the stETH non-E-Mode parameters.\n\n**wstETH E-Mode Arbitrum**\n\nUpdate ETH-correlated E-Mode parameters with the following values.\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 90% | 93% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93% | 95% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 2% | 1% |\n\nWe propose no changes to the stETH non-E-Mode parameters.\n\n**wstETH E-Mode Optimism**\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Loan To Value (LTV) | 90% | 93% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93% | 95% |\n\nWe propose no changes to the stETH non-E-Mode parameters.\n\n********WETH Ethereum********\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% |\n| Optimal Ratio | 80% | 90% |\n\nOther parameters will remain unchanged. \n\n********WETH Arbitrum********\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% |\n| Optimal Ratio | 80% | 90% |\n\nOther parameters will remain unchanged. \n\n********WETH Optimism********\n\n| Risk Parameter | Current Value | Proposed Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% |\n| Optimal Ratio | 80% | 90% |\n\nOther parameters will remain unchanged. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The vote timeline and forum sentiment indicate solid support for Option B, which proposes paying bounties 1 and 2 fully and reducing bounty 3 to $50k due to controversy around the third bounty and behavior of the researcher.",
    "key_arguments_for": [
      "The majority of voters and key community members support rewarding the white-hat contributions fairly, especially given the lack of a formal bounty program at the time of the reports.",
