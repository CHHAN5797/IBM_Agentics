This proposal seeks to encourage Stader Labs to continue distributing SD rewards by increasing the Supply Cap and enabling more MaticX to be deposited into Aave.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions conducive to growing TVL and Revenue by facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. \n\nThe below details various proposals reflecting Llama's efforts to date:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n* [ARFC MaticX Polygon v3 Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555)\n* [ARFC MaticX SupplyCap Increase Polygon v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-supplycap-increase-polygon-v3/12217/12)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nThe below chart shows the growth of MaticX supply on both Ethereum and Polygon. The recent spike in Polygon circulating supply is the result of the previous Supply Cap discussion on Aave v3 governance forum and the resulting outreach to various whales. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HzidlG1.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7KgR8XR.png)\n\nThe chart shows a clear growth since 16th February when SD rewards were initiated. There is a clear link between SD emissions on Aave v3 and MaticX growth.\n\nUsing the [Chaos Labs Updated Supply and Borrow Cap Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-updated-supply-and-borrow-cap-methodology/11602) the MaticX Supply Cap can be increased from 17.2M units to 34.4M units. Doubling of the Supply Cap is acheived by overlooking the limitations of circulating supply and focusing on liquidity which follows the rational of the previous Supply Cap adjustment. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xW01WDf.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iMHRNbO.png)\nRatio exceeds 2.0 and thus, maximum increase in the Supply Cap is 100%.\n\nWith reference to the new [ARFC Aave V3 Caps update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/1) it is possible to ship several upgrades to gradually increasing Aave's exposure to MaticX over time.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters have been proposed by Llama for the community to review and discuss in the comments section.\n\nTicker: MaticX\n\nContract: [`polygon: 0xfa68FB4628DFF1028CFEc22b4162FCcd0d45efb6`](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6)\n\nOption 1 - 19.6M Supply Cap\nOption 2 - 29.3M Supply Cap\nOption 3 - NAE\nOption 4 - ABSTAIN\n\nOption 1 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\nOption 2 - Represents 50% of MaticX Supply on Polygon.\n\nPlease do read over the comments on the governance forum and review the vote linked [here](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba) before casting a vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This will enable AGD contributors and grant recipients to be rewarded with GHO, and any other asset held in the AGD's multisig. \n\nWith GHO trading beneath $1, the Aave DAO can acquire GHO on market which will help support the peg and then use the GHO to provide funding to AGD. Distributing GHO  will promote the usage and adoption of GHO.\n\nThe Aave DAO is sending a strong signal of support for GHO by using it to reward contributors to the community. Over time, we hope all AGD and Service Provider expenses are settled in GHO.\n\nThis proposal will likely be implemented around the time the ARFC to increase [GHO's interest rate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-gho-borrow-rate/14612) is to be implemented and the issue flagged [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temporarily-pausing-gho-integration-in-aave/14626) has been resolved. Both proposals are expected to help support the GHO peg.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following assets from the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO. \n\n* 228,000 units of aEthUSDC\n* 150,000 units of aEthUSDT\n\nThe DAI allowance is to be cancelled.\n\nA GHO allowance is to be created to the value of 385,000 units (estimation of GHO acquired from swaps).\n\nThe AGD mulisig `eth:0x89C51828427F70D77875C6747759fB17Ba10Ceb0` will be able to use the allowance function on `0xE4621DfD503A533f42bB5a45162eA3e5233Acd5F` to claim the GHO. \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Enabling borrowing with a reasonable BorrowCap and the introduction of borrowing rewards, will lead to significant utilisation of the MaticX reserve. \n\nThis proposal facilitates the expansion of MaticX yield based strategies on Aave v3 Polygon by creating more favourable bootstrapping conditions. The introduction of liquidity mining rewards are expected to drive notable inflows and usage to the v3 deployment. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the previous months, Llama has been working with various communities to craft favourable conditions on Aave v3 Polygon to facilitate the creation of several yield aggregation products. The below proposals details are applicable:\n\n* [Proposal to add MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon Market](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/79950)\n* [ARFC Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-polygon-wmatic-interest-rate-update/10290)\n* [ARFC SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sd-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10658)\n* [ARFC stMATIC & MaticX Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-stmatic-maticx-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632)\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the above work.\n\nIn support of the upcoming liquidity rewards distribution, this proposal seeks to increase the SupplyCap, enable borrowing and introduce a BorrowCap sufficient to create a notable deposit yield.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GSWOAxP.png)\n\nDetailed analysis can be found on the governance forum, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following risk parameters are being proposed and have been reviewed by [Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-maticx-polygon-v3-upgrade/11555/6).\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Loan To Value|58.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|67.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|SupplyCap|8.6M units|\n|Borrowing|Enabled|\n|BorrowingCap|5.2M|\n\nThe following interest rate parameters have been reviewed by Llama.\n\n|Parameter|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Slope1|4.00%|\n|Slope2|150.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing |Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1 |0.50%|\n|Stable Slope2 |150.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset |2.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00%|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GHO Funding\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-09-17\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication seeks to acquire GHO from secondary markets to support the Aave DAO's short-term funding needs.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe objective of this publication is to further transition Aave DAO's expenses towards being nominated in GHO. The below highlights some potential use cases for GHO:\n\n* 870,000 over 6 months [Aave Grants Continuation Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14831)\n    * Another 300,000 GHO if AAVE is replaced with GHO\n* 75,000 GHO over 3 months [Expansion of “Orbit”](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-expansion-of-orbit-a-dao-funded-delegate-platform-initiative/14785)\n* 406,000 GHO over 3 months [GHO Liquidity Committee](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-create-and-fund-gho-liquidity-committee/14800)\n* TBA Future ACI Funding Request (Renewal mid-October)\n\nAlthough the GHO Liquidity Committee is funded via its own AIP, its inclusion here indicates the magnitude of the potential ongoing spend. The current ACI funding proposal is 250,000 aUSDT, which serves only as a budgetary estimate. Similarly, the 406,000 over the back 3 months of a 6-month lookahead is used as a budgetary estimate.\n\nThe spend identified above over the next 6 months is 1.676M GHO, or 1.976M GHO if AAVE is replaced with GHO within AGD proposal.\n\nThere is also the potential [420,000 GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-swap-b-80bal-20weth-to-gho/14684) being acquired by swapping B-80BAL-20wETH to GHO via the Aave Swap Contract.\n\nThere is also the potential for additional expenses to emerge, such as a renewal proposal from Gauntlet during late Q4 2023. An additional proposal will be presented closer to the time to accommodate any new GHO nominated expenses.\n\nThis publication proposes converting 1.6M of stable coins held in the Ethereum Treasury to GHO. This will complement the existing realized GHO revenue. The GHO is to be held in the Treasury where existing service providers receive payment from.\n\nAt the time of writing, swapping to acquire GHO will generate positive slippage, and the entire swap can be performed without causing GHO to trade above the $1 peg. The Aave DAO can then distribute GHO amongst the community using a price of $1.\n\n# Specification\n\nUsing the Aave Swap Contract, convert the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* 49,900 aDAI v2\n* 69,800 aBUSD v2\n* 75,800 aTUSD v2\n* 381,700 aBUSD v1\n* 400,000 aEthDAI v3\n* 622,800 aUSDT v2\n\nThe GHO will be transferred to the [Aave Ethereum Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c).\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The initial commit from the Aura Finance team was 400,000 units of vlAURA for an initial 3 month duration.\n\nThis proposal seeks to replace the support from Aura Finance by acquiring 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO. Olympus DAO is reducing there AURA exposure due to change in the Olympus DAO roadmap which is detailed [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3756-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus) and [her](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3967-tap29-aura-solicitation-to-bid).\n\nBased upon the research presented in this [Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682), which details impact AIP-42 by Aura Finance, the most efficient way for Aave DAO to bootstrap GHO is via vlAURA relative to veBAL. \n\nOlympus DAO seeks payment in DAI, at an exchange rate of 0.9470 DAI per unit of AURA. The amount of AURA is 443,674 with a total cost to Aave DAO of 420,159.28 units of DAI. Aave DAO currently holds [2.873M](https://etherscan.io/token/0x028171bca77440897b824ca71d1c56cac55b68a3?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) units of aDAI on Aave v2.\n\n**Olympus DAO is conducting an open forum auction over 3 day period, bids are placed relative to the spot price derived from the AURA/wETH pool on Balancer v2.\n\nThe USD price will be updated within this proposal progressively over the bidding period. Do note, Aave DAO's governance process duration exceeds that of Olympus DAO's which means Aave DAO's voting occurs afterwards and ultimately determines if/when the OTC swap will occur**\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will achieve the following:\n\n* Redeem 420,159.28 units aDAI from Aave v2\n* Exchange 420,159.28 units of DAI for 443,674 units of AURA with Olympus DAO\n\nFor reference, Olympus DAO AURA Holding Address: `0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B`\n\nThe contract shall be developed in collaboration with @MarcZeller and deployed by the ACI team.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem. TokenLogic seeks to become an Aave DAO Service Provider.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
