        "body": "FranklinDAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) is creating this proposal in partnership with Matter Labs to Deploy Aave V3 on zkSync 2.0 Testnet \n\nProposal link: https://governance.aave.com/t/deploy-aave-v3-on-zksync-v2-0-testnet/10340 \n\n**Summary**\n\nTo support Aave’s multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Aave V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community.\n\nThe zkSync team will submit a snapshot to launch Aave V3 on ZkSync V2 testnet, and thereafter another snapshot for mainnet (when the criteria for DEX liquidity and other items are met).\n\nzkSync ecosystem has over 200 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.\nDeploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Aave by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation\nzkSync shares Ethereum’s ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership\n\n**About zkSync**\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a [ZK rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.\nzkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:\nEVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps\nToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools\nEthos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source\nCertainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability\nFuture Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code\nThere is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSync’s EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.\n\n**References**\n\n- Matter Labs Github: [Matter Labs · GitHub](https://github.com/matter-labs)\n- zkSync Homepage: https://zksync.io/\n- zkSync 2.0 Testnet Docs: [zkSync Documentation | zkSync: secure, scalable crypto payments](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/)\n- Blog Posts: https://blog.matter-labs.io/ \n- zkSync Mainnet Alpha Registration: [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdXAoQiHLu16ykEoOb762uvC1bAhdzOG-YDk6ju0YwPWf3Fw/viewform)\n\n\n**Technicalities**\n\n- Solidity/Vyper support; recommended to use ^0.8.0 and Vyper ^0.3.3 [details](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/developer-guides/contracts/contracts.html#solidity-vyper-support) \n- RPC is public: We fully support the Ethereum JSON API, with some additions for L2-level features. More information [here](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/api/api.html#zksync-specific-json-rpc-methods)\n- The Graph is currently indexing zkSync v1 and v2\n- Covalent available immediately after mainnet\n- Working on all other plugins (ape, founders, remix, truffle, tenderly)\n- Chainlink finalising, deploying shortly after mainnet\n- Audits in progress with multiple tier 1 auditors and [bug bounty program](https://docs.zksync.io/dev/security/bug-bounty/)\n\n\n**Timeline**\n\nzkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and has launched mainnet baby alpha as of October 28th. A timely assessment of the deployment of Aave v3 code to zkSync is important: our team has already tested the smart contract library (mostly key ones) it was compiling and looked like it was working fine.\n\n**Proposal Stages:**\n\nThe zkSync team will first submit a snapshot for testnet deployment, following the community guidelines.\nThen when the time comes, another snapshot for mainnet (when the criteria for DEX liquidity and other items are met)\n\n**Authors:**\n\nzkSync team",

        "body": "Deploy Aave on Cronos chain\n\nThe following proposal follows the ARC draft proposal posted for comments [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deploy-aave-v3-on-cronos-chain/7287), more than 5 days ago, that follows the standard governance process framework.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nLaunched in 2021 after years of open-source R&D, Cronos is #9 public blockchain by DeFi value locked according to  [Defillama](https://defillama.com/chains)  (around 2.5 B$ TVL to date). Cronos proposes to deploy Aave V3 to the Cronos chain and to incentivize liquidity in order to help fulfill the promise of a multi-chain future.\n\nCronos is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on Cosmos SDK technology. An open-source Layer 1 chain launched under the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  umbrella, Cronos aims to massively scale the DeFi and dApp (Web3) user community by providing builders with the ability to instantly port apps and crypto assets from other chains while benefiting from low transaction fees, high throughput, and fast finality.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, hundreds of millions of consumers have purchased their first cryptos, the majority via a centralized exchange. Tens of millions of them already have a connection with the strategic partners of the Cronos project: as [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  customers, as holders of CRO or other tokens of the Cosmos ecosystem, and/or as [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  project supporters. These crypto users are now eager to take the next step in Web3. For them, Cronos is a natural gateway into the broader world of self-custody, Ethereum and DeFi.\n\nThe cross-chain future that is such an integral part of Aave V3, resonates well with the motivations of Cronos users. Therefore, Cronos represents an ideal ground to demonstrate the promise of Aave V3.\n\n**Technical specifications of the network**\n\n*Network specifications*\n\n[Cronos](https://cronos.crypto.org/)  is an open-source project launched by  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  that brings together many  [open-source initiatives](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/blob/main/go.mod#L22)  of the Ethereum, Cosmos and IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) ecosystems. At its core, it is a fully EVM-compatible alternative Layer 1 blockchain built using the Cosmos SDK (Ethermint implementation).\n\nCronos mainnet has been live since November 2021 and is already home to more than 120 partners and more than 340,000 DeFi and NFT users. Cronos is powered by the CRO cryptocurrency, which counts tens of millions of holders and users worldwide thanks to its support by  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) . All key network statistics can be viewed on the Etherscan deployment, called  [Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/charts)  , as well as on  [Defillama for TVL data](https://defillama.com/chain/Cronos)  .\n\nAt the protocol level, Cronos relies on a Proof of Authority consensus where each validator’s voting power is proportional to their stake in the protocol’s staking token. There are currently 26 live validators, with room for more. The consensus delivers fast finality with block times between 5 and 6 seconds, low transaction fees (usually below 1 USD) paid in CRO token, and small environmental footprint.\n\nUsers and Dapp developers interact with Cronos primarily through the usual EVM Web3 JSON-RPC  [endpoints](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  . They can deploy any EVM-compatible smart contract written in Solidity, and can use all the usual end-user and developer tooling: MetaMask, Etherscan block explorer ([Cronoscan](https://cronoscan.com/) ), Gnosis Safe, Truffle, Hardhat, Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3.py, etc.\n\nThe Cronos team is actively in contact with the relevant teams to implement all the components needed for robust Aave V3 deployment and operations, specifically the Chainlink oracle, The Graph indexer, and commercial and JSON-RPC endpoints for Dapps (in addition to the existing  [free ones](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#json-rpc-namespaces)  ). These teams are in process of assigning engineering resources to work on these project. A likely target launch date for these additional components is early Q2 2022. Cronos protocol engineering resources stand ready to support these projects.\n\nThere are several bridges between Cronos and other networks :\n\n* [Live] Fast withdrawals from and to the  [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)  app and exchange.\n* [Upcoming] Native bridge from and to the Ethereum mainnet via Gravity Bridge technology, currently in testing and planned for imminent launch.\n* [Live] IBC transfers from and to the  [Crypto.org](http://crypto.org/)  chain, Cosmos Hub, and Terra, with more IBC-compatible chains on the roadmap.\n* [Live] EVM smart contract-based transfers from and to BSC, Polygon, and other EVM chains via 3 independent bridges, with more to come.\n* Security review of additional bridges is under way.\n\nCronos is an open ecosystem supported by a wide range of more than 120  [contributors](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  ,  [validators](https://cronos.crypto.org/partners)  , and  [Dapp developers](https://cronos.crypto.org/ecosystem)  . This includes 2 large AMM/DEXes, VVS Finance (1.4 B$ TVL) and MM Finance (320 M$ TVL).\n\nThe  [roadmap](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-chain-journey-so-far-and-2022-roadmap-3475abbe6254)  is ambitious and includes protocol and database optimizations, further connectivity and interoperability, best-in-class tooling and infrastructure, further protocol governance decentralization, dozens of DeFi and GameFi Dapps, and longer term plans to increase scalability.\n\n*Aave V3 implementation*\n\nAs part of this proposal, Aave V3 will be deployed to Cronos like any Web3 protocol, given that Cronos is fully EVM-compatible. Aave operations will rely on the Chainlink oracle and The Graph indexer (implementation under way).\n\nThe Aave V3 Portal will be able to leverage robust EVM-based cross-chain bridges (such as Connext and others, subject to further testing and security review) for the transfer of underlying assets backing aTokens.\n\n*Metrics and references*\n\nChain data as of Feb 15, 2022:\n* 26 live validators.\n* 15+ M transactions to date (no transaction pumping!)\n* 150,000 to 200,000 transactions per day, with potential to increase by 5x to 20x in the short term.\n* 350,000 unique wallets.\n* More than 120 Dapps deployed in the last 3 months, including VVS (DEX, 1.4 B$ TVL), MM Finance (DEX, 320 M$ TVL), Tectonic (decentralized lending, 275 M$ TVL), and others.\n\nAudience data\n*  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cronos_chain)  : 130k followers.\n*  [Telegram](https://t.me/Cryptoorg_Chain_Announcements)  : 7k subscribers.\n*  [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pahqHz26q4)  : 19,000 members.\n\nLinks\n*  [Cronos website](https://cronos.crypto.org/) \n*  [Particle B ecosystem development program](https://medium.com/cronos-chain/cronos-ecosystem-grants-7a4a2de3b721) \n*  [Blockchain explorer](https://cronoscan.com/) \n*  [Particle B accelerator](https://www.particleb.com/) \n*  [Cronos integration documentation](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html) \n*  [Github](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos)  repository\n*  [Overview of Cosmos SDK and Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/nodes/)  node architecture\n\n**Proposed list of initial collaterals**\n\nThe proposed list of initial collaterals is: CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, ATOM, LUNA, DOT.\n\nAs indicated above, Chainlink price feeds are being scheduled for deployment.\n\nCronos already supports the  [following cross-chain assets](https://cronos.crypto.org/docs/resources/chain-integration.html#integration-guide-for-cronos-mainnet-beta)  : CRO, WETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, SHIB, DOGE, ATOM, LINK, ENJ, ELON, TUSD, LUNA, DOT, BIFI, with more to come. Additional native tokens include VVS, TONIC. These tokens have between 10 M$ and 700 M$ of liquidity on Cronos. Daily volume for the corresponding pairs is between 20 and 30 M$.\n\nThe proposed tokens have more than, or close to, 2 M$ daily volume each. With respect to DEX statistics, see  [VVS analytics](https://vvs.finance/info)  for history and liquidity per token.\n\n**Incentives**\n\nParticle B, the Web3 accelerator of the Cronos chain, has an initial allocation of USD 100 million in CRO tokens for ecosystem development. A portion of these funds will be allocated to end-user incentives, commensurate with the large user and TVL growth potential of Aave V3 on Cronos.\n\nIn our experience, the effectiveness of liquidity mining incentives varies depending on market conditions, hence the exact programs and amounts (expected to be worth several M$) will need to be refined over time.\n\n**Audits and security**\n\nCronos mainnet was launched in November 2021 and has not experienced outages so far.\n\nAn audit of relevant components of the underlying Ethermint codebase (  [crypto](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/crypto)  ,  [JSON RPC](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/ethereum/rpc)  ,  [Ante handler](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/tree/main/app)  ,  [EVM state transition](https://github.com/tharsis/ethermint/blob/main/x/evm/keeper/state_transition.go)  ) was commissioned by Foris Ltd and completed by Kudelski Security. It is published in the Cronos Github repository ([link](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/cronos/tree/main/docs/audit)).\n\nA bug bounty program is  [published](https://immunefi.com/bounty/cronos/)  , with a bounty of up to 1.3 M$.\n\nThank you for your support !",

        "body": "Summary\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Neon EVM Devnet.\n\nProposal\nTo support Aave’s multichain expansion, we propose the deployment of Aave V3 to Neon EVM on behalf of the community. \n\nNeon EVM is a first-of-kind EVM-compatibility solution for the Solana blockchain. The tool allows Ethereum-like transactions to be processed on Solana, allowing Ethereum dApp developers to leverage their knowledge of Solidity, developer tooling, and existing codebases to scale with Solana, which lets dApps take advantage of the best features from both blockchains. Neon EVM offers Ethereum ecosystem dApp developers increased throughput and swift block time on Solana, with low gas prices and no need for changing code – anyone can run Ethereum contracts on Solana with Neon EVM. It also introduces incentivised transactions-facilitating Neon EVM operators to the Solana blockchain. Neon Operator runs Neon Proxy servers, which helps facilitate seamless execution of Ethereum-like transactions on Solana. This allows Ethereum dApps to be ported to Neon with no code change. Neon is here to foster friendship between both communities and chains by adopting the developer tools and compute layer present on Ethereum and reducing friction for Ethereum developers looking to expand to Solana. \n\nNeon EVM ecosystem has numerous projects in its pipeline committed to launching during mainnet and shortly after the launch of mainnet, including blue-chip DeFi protocols, wallets, fiat on/off ramps, infrastructure, DAO tooling, etc.\n\n\nCommitted to support our ecosystem builders and see them succeed, Neon Foundation will provide following support levels that include but are not limited to:\nEcosystem Grants (Application/Approval based)\nAmbassador Program (Application/Approval based)\nBounty Program (Application/Approval based)\nEcosystem Funds (Application/Approval based)\n\n\nNeon EVM is a trustless and open-source project, which will be governed by DAO and Neon Foundation is committed to ethos of decentralisation and community ownership. As we are paving the path towards the open economy, it is highly imperative to have trusted and established lending & borrowing protocols such as Aave within our ecosystem. We believe that Neon-Aave integration will provide users with more choices, enable users to tap into distinct ecosystems from both sides and contribute to the expansion of Web3 economy. \n\n\nDeploying on Neon EVM will onboard new users & increase user activity on Aave by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum, taking advantage of Solana’s throughput, and enabling users to tap into Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. Neon EVM has a robust and surging DeFi ecosystem with distinct players such as AMMs, lending & borrowing protocols, derivatives etc. Having a flagship protocol like Aave would be highly valuable to our ecosystem; since we both share similar values when it comes to decentralisation and community ownership. \n\n\nNeon EVM is highly open to work together with the Aave community to determine optimal strategies for liquidity incentivisation, marketing, awareness campaigns, technical support and additional benefits that are tremendously important for both communities. \n\n\nThe Neon Foundation team would like to take this opportunity and thank the Aave community for granting us the opportunity to make this proposal and we look forward to onboarding Aave to the Neon EVM ecosystem and building a long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationship.\n",

        "title": "Deploy Aave V3 on Evmos",
        "author": "0xf3b7BbCe60284E7D9282bc109B35deBA278Ca067",
        "body": "Evmos proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Evmos blockchain to expand lending to the Evmos and greater Cosmos ecosystem. Evmos will be the port of entry to Cosmos for Ethereum users and vice-versa with the introduction of developer-focused incentives, interoperability across other Cosmos chains and interchain composability.\n\n**Summary**\n\nEvmos is an application-agnostic chain that will be interoperable with the Ethereum mainnet, EVM-compatible environments, and other BFT chains via IBC, making it easy for users and developers to interact seamlessly between chains. Rather than being competitive with Ethereum, Evmos aims to expand the functionality of the EVM to offer interoperability that enables new use cases. EVM bridges ([Nomad and Connext](https://evmos.blog/bridging-assets-to-evmos-with-nomad-and-connext-e8ec182145d5)) will integrate with Evmos shortly after mainnet launch to allow Ethereum and other EVM chains’ ERC-20 tokens to be available on Evmos and subsequently the entire Cosmos ecosystem via IBC.\n\nEvmos was founded by Federico Kunze Küllmer and Akash Khosla. Federico has been a core contributor to a number of Cosmos projects including Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, Core IBC, Gravity Bridge (formerly Peggy) and Sommelier. He has been building in the blockchain space since 2017 when he was an exchange student at UC Berkeley, where he joined Blockchain at Berkeley. Akash had been working in the Cosmos ecosystem at Anchorage and as a Co-Founder of Blockchain at Berkeley, the blockchain innovation hub where many of the original Cosmos developers started their careers. He’s been working on blockchain and cryptocurrencies since 2016 as a Software Engineer at Anchorage, Chain and Earn.com, in addition to contributing to open source projects like Interledger.\n\nThe Cosmos ecosystem has been growing steadily with new application-specific chains being launched every week. Interchain DEXes have been deployed on Cosmos, among which Osmosis is already the second-largest DEX token by Market Cap ([source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/osmosis)) and is in the top 10 dexes by volume and TVL despite only being live for six months ([source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/dex)), which demonstrates the rapid growth of activity in Cosmos. By deploying to Evmos, AAVE will be able to capture a significant amount of user activity and fill the need for reliable lending protocols in Cosmos. Evmos will also enable cross-chain applications to leverage AAVE’s liquidity while being deployed to other Cosmos chains such as Terra. All of this growth will be further catalyzed by Evmos’ native usage incentives which will give the Evmos community the opportunity to allocate 25% of the block allocation of EVMOS tokens through governance to support AAVE’s growth and development. Additionally, funds from the community pool can be allocated to liquidity mining incentives through governance.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThere is great potential for synergy between Evmos and Aave. The Evmos ecosystem has been growing quickly with our live testnet and is launching with all of the infrastructure, tools and clients that developers require to deploy their contracts, including node and validator operator services, indexers, oracles, bridges and more.\n\nEvmos goes above and beyond to align with developers and users through its [tokenomics](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b). Two key ways this alignment happens is through fee splits where EIP1559 is modified to give 50% of transaction fees to contract deployers rather than burning it as well as usage incentives which allocate 25% of all newly minted Evmos tokens to a usage incentive pool. This pool is fully controlled by governance enabling the community to allocate incentives for AAVE users. AAVE users have already been included in the Evmos RektDrop which rewards active Cosmos, Osmosis, and Ethereum users. You can read more about Evmos’ novel [tokenomics](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-token-model-edc07014978b) and the [RektDrop](https://evmos.blog/the-evmos-rektdrop-abbe931ba823) in our blog.\n\n**References**\n\n💻 Developer Documentation:<https://evmos.dev/>\n\n👾 Official Discord:<https://discord.gg/evmos>\n\n🐙 GitHub:<https://github.com/tharsis/evmos>\n\n🕊 Twitter:<https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg>\n\n📯 Telegram:[@EvmosOrg](https://t.me/EvmosOrg)\n\n📄 Medium:<https://evmos.blog/>\n\n🖥 Evmos Website:[https://evmos.org](https://evmos.org/)\n\n**Specifications**\n\n- What is the link between the author of the proposal and Evmos?\n\n  - The author of this proposal is a core Evmos team member.\n\n- Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token:\n\n  - With a launch planned for February 2022, Evmos is an application-agnostic chain that will be interoperable with the Ethereum mainnet, EVM-compatible environments, and other BFT chains via IBC, making it easy for users and developers to interact seamlessly between chains. Evmos aims to be the port of entry to Cosmos from Ethereum, making it easy to deploy smart contracts that expand interoperability with the Cosmos ecosystem.\n  - Evmos’ native token, EVMOS, is used to secure the Evmos network through staking, to enable governance voting for network decisions, and to pay transactions fees on the network.\n\n  \n\n\n**Evmos and Cosmos Ecosystem Metrics**\n\n- \\>1,300 validators participated in the Evmos incentivized testnet\n\n- 3 native dexes coming to Evmos\n\n- Cosmos Ecosystem Market Cap is valued at over $124.5 billion collectively ([source](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem/tokens))\n\n- Osmosis, the primary interchain DEX of Cosmos has the second highest market cap for DEX tokens, being surpassed only by Uniswap\n\n  - Osmosis has a TVL of $1.2B\n\n- IBC usage growth with over 5M IBC transactions over the last 30 days and 600 channels and IBC-enabled chains have a market cap of over $56 billion.\n\n- Over 30 IBC-enabled chains with many more launching in early 2022\n\n\n\n**Audience data**\n\n- Twitter (@EvmosOrg): 31K\n- Telegram (@EvmosOrg): 6.4K\n- Discord (discord.gg/evmos): 25.6K\n\n**Incentives**\n\nOne of the key designs Evmos focused on is offering developer and user incentives natively. While many protocols deploy funds from foundations and make unilateral decisions of which protocols should benefit from them, Evmos offers a governance-controlled usage incentives pool which is funded by 25% of the block emission. This enables the community to allocate a portion of usage incentives to AAVE users to encourage organic growth of the protocol and increase its adoption.\n\nIn 4 years, this will total 200 million Evmos tokens. The size of this pool is large because users are the backbone of any crypto project. Usage Incentive rewards are based on gas spent on contract interactions and rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch (1-week).\n\nIn addition to Usage Rewards, token holders can leverage governance on Evmos to allocate a portion of the community pool to additional liquidity mining rewards. The community pool accounts for 10% of the supply which can be used to fund incentive programs.\n\n**Technical Specifications**\n\nEvmos will have support for The Graph, Gnosis Safe, and we are actively working with Chainlink to finalize support to enable a fully functional Aave v3 deployment by mainnet.\n\n**Initial Supported Assets**\n\n- USDC\n- USDT\n- DAI\n- FRAX\n- AAVE\n- WETH\n- WBTC\n- OSMO\n- EVMOS\n- ATOM\n",

        "body": "Discussion: \n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-deployment-to-bittorrent-chain-bttc/6813 \n\nSummary\n\nThe BitTorrent DAO Community asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into BitTorrent Chain (known as BTTC), which can expand lending to the BitTorrent community and, with the provision of incentives, bootstrap the launch of Aave on a new ecosystem.\n\nProposer\n\nBitTorrent Chain is an open-source, EVM-compatible blockchain that offers high concurrency, higher submission speed, lower transaction fees, and smoother operations. Since BTTC is fully-compatible with TRON, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, users are able to transfer mainstream assets among TRON, Ethereum, and BSC in a decentralized manner. Openness and accessibility are core values that we practice through our cross-chain strategy, and we find that aligns well with Aave goals.\n\nWe seek to support Aave in its multichain expansion and invite Aave to enable the Aave v2 front-end for BTTC. We believe that BTTC is ready-made to support Aave: BTTC offers a secure infrastructure (multi-node validation), heterogeneous cross-chain solution, faster transaction confirmation (PoS consensus mechanism with an average block time between 2-3 seconds) , and lower transaction fees (<$0.01 on average).\n\nAs the Layer 2 of TRON, BTTC inherits the advanced technology and resources from TRON, as well as $1.1bn TRON Ecosystem Fund. Since TRON’s MainNet release on May 31, 2018, TRON has risen to become the world’s fastest-growing public chain and the world’s largest network in terms of stablecoin settlement. Currently TRON boasts a staggering $70 billion worth of assets, over 66 million TRON accounts, and more than 39.9 billion TRC20-USDT in circulation on its network.\n\nMoreover, BTTC integrates with Binance Smart Chain, which has one of the strongest deflationary mechanisms and currently has more daily active addresses than the rest of all layer 1s combined. That compatibility makes BTTC a better fit for DeFi applications like Aave.\n\nWe are convinced that BTTC is key to ushering in an era of connecting all chains, helping achieve rapid growth across the DeFi space, especially the Aave community.\n\nRationale\n\nCurrent status of the BitTorrent Chain\n\nBitTorrent Chain’s vision is to provide a high-performance, highly scalable, low-cost solution for blockchain platforms that delivers a superior user experience for decentralized applications without sacrificing decentralization while leveraging the existing developer ecosystem.\n\nBTTC is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of consensus. As the first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol in the industry, users can transfer assets within TRON, Ethereum, BSC without any limits. The PoS consensus network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 2-3 seconds, making the network an incredible homecourt for DeFi and other EVM applications.\n\nWhy is it good for the Aave ecosystem?\n\nBTTC is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, economic, and instant finality. The BitTorrent DAO Community has allocated up to $1bn for users of the Aave protocol. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established TRON community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on BTTC will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThere is great potential for synergy between BTTC and Aave. As a close partner of TRON, BTTC will be able to contribute more than $1bn on Aave, and there are already more than $800mn assets of BTTC community on the Aave. The TRON DeFi ecosystem is thriving: Total Value Locked across TRON DeFi protocols is $5.39bn and growing. Many well-known protocols such as JustLend, Sunswap, amongst others, have deployed on TRON. On BTTC, Aave would find many users eager to participate in lending markets and add value to the Aave network.\n\nBesides, as BTTC integrates more mainstream public chains like BSC, it will ease down the process of interacting between users and Aave, and that will definitely catapult the Aave ecosystem to the next level.\n\nWhy is signaling necessary?\n\nConsistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, we believe that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on–and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. Deploying the Aave protocol on BTTC will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.\n\nReference: \nHomepage: https://bt.io/\nGithub: https://github.com/bttcprotocol\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BitTorrent\nMedium: https://medium.com/@BitTorrent\nTelegram: https://t.me/BitTorrentChain\n\n\n",
