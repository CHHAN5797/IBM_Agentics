        "body": "Note: This proposal has been posted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created program to distribute up to 75,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through the January 31, 2024. It asks all participating grantees to self report data, and dashboards, summarizing grant performance.\n\n**Motivation**\nThis provisional framework aims to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed (1 19, 2 7, 3 4, 4 5).\nThe goals of the program are to:\n•\tSupport Network Growth: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n•\tExperiment with Incentive Grants: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n•\tFind new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n•\tCreate Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n**Rationale**\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n**Specifications**\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 75,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n \n![8b05a5d34faf8659a144f1d35081a89ae83e237e.png](ipfs://bafkreiaizvrpzwo5bn6lxl5ikdywhfakyphtdukgkywpuzpvlrokaaj2oe)\n     \nFollowing a successful Snapshot Temperature Check, the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check will be designed to both achieve consensus and approve funding across four options, where each vote will distinguish support of up to X ARB through the end of January 31, 2024:\n•\tFor up to **25M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **50M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **75M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tAgainst.\n\n**Financial Proposal**\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n•\tA ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and application template 37 as articulated in this document.\n•\tApproval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n•\tA 25,000,000, 50,000,000 or 75,000,000 ARB distribution to the program Multisig.\n•\tA 32,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\no\t20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n\tDraft and review of multiple iterations of incentive proposals.\n\tModeration of community calls and working group telegram.\n\tCoordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\no\t12,000 ARB Multisig Signers (A new version of the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig 17 - 2K per signer).\n\n**Multisig Setup**\nA new multisig will be created with the signers from the original pl-ARB multisig, under the name of the Arbitrum DAO. The new multisig will include two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1.\tClawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2.\tStreaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n**What are the Eligibility Requirements?**\n\nGrant Requirements:\n•\tGrantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n•\tGrantees must not farm their own incentive programs.\n•\tGrantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n•\tGrantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard or alternatively in a report.\n•\tGrantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n•\tGrantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n•\tGrantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n•\tGrants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n•\tGrantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n•\tGrantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n•\tGrantees must apply using the approved program application template 15.\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n•\tAny use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n•\tFailure to comply with data reporting standards.\no\tGrantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n•\t•\tDashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n•\t•\tMore granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\no\tIf dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n**Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines**\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there’s no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n•\t**Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $1.5M TVL.\n\t.>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $4M TVL.\n\t.>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n\t.> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n\tMeets one of the following criteria\n\t.> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n\t.> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\n*Grants greater than $1M ARB will be asked to include milestone-based funding tranches in their application.\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n**Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?**\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\nCycle 1\n1.\tApplication Period (1 Week):\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application Template 20.\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2.\tReview Period (1 Week):\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3.\tVoting Period (1 Week):\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the PL-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\nCycle 2\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n**Timeline**\n[See image above]\nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 09, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\n\nCycle 1\nSep. 16, 2023 - On-Chain Vote and Application Period\nSep. 23, 2023 - Review Period Begins\nSep. 30, 2023 - Voting Round Begins\nOct. 07, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\nCycle 2\nOct 07, 2023 - Application Period 2 Begins\nOct 14, 2023 - Review Period 2 Begins\nOct 28, 2023 - Voting Round 2 Begins\nNov. 04, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\n**Overall Cost**\nUp to 75,032,000 ARB.\n\n**Outstanding Questions and Concerns**\n\nWhat happens if the budget is exceeded?\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 75M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\nWhat will happen to excess funds?\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\nWhat is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of allowing incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\nWhat are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?\n•\tCommunity Support: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n•\tNetwork Activity: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n•\tCommunity Awareness: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n•\tIncentives Data: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n**Forum Link **\n\nThis snapshot is replication of the forum post.

        "body": "## **Abstract**\n\nWe introduce an Experimental Incentive System aimed at the ArbitrumDAO delegates with a duration of six months. The goal is to assess the incentives' impact on the delegates' active participation and involvement in the DAO's governance. *This proposal is subject to changes.*\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThis proposal represents an improved version compared to previous initiatives and requests for comments (RFCs):\n\n- [[RFC-2] Delegate Incentive System for ArbitrumDAO](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-2-delegate-incentive-system-for-arbitrumdao/15720)\n- [[DRAFT] Experimental Incentive System for Active ArbitrumDAO Delegates](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/draft-experimental-incentive-system-for-active-arbitrumdao-delegates/16501)\n\nWe have developed this new proposal considering the comments and observations provided by other delegates. Our additional motivation lies in the recent increase in proposals and increased activity within ArbitrumDAO. We believe that delegates are the core base of the DAO and should be properly incentivized to maintain active participation, both in voting and feedback on proposals and in the ideation of governance processes.\n\n# **Delegate Incentive System**\n\n## **Before reading the proposal, note how we have decided to structure it**\n\nThis proposal is structured into four main sections:\n\n* **Option 1:** This is our main proposal detailing all the specifications of the incentive system.\n* **Option 2:** Introduces the implementation of \"Karma\" to automate certain processes. It's important to note that this option entails additional costs.\n* **General Summary:** An overview of the proposed items.\n* **Next Steps:** Voting deadline\n\n# **Option 1 - Main Proposal**\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Duration of the Incentive System\n\nWe've allocated an initial trial period of 6 months. This timeframe should allow us to gather initial metrics to gauge the system's functionality and its anticipated impact.\n\n## Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives\n\nWe have set the number at **50 delegates**. This figure isn't based on specific reasoning, but we believe it's a reasonable starting point.\n\n## Funding\n\n- Incentives for delegates: 1,500,000 ARB\n- Incentive Program Administrator: 25,000 ARB\n\n## Delegate Selection Process\n\n### Requirements\n\nBased on the feedback received, we've opted for a single tier instead of a multi-tiered program, allowing a wider array of participants, the requirements would be as follows:\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n> **Note:**\n> * So following this model, the top fifty delegates - defined by their final score - within the range, would be compensated\n> * The 5000 ARB per month is the max amount a delegate could earn, but this amount could be lower depending on their score.\n> * Certain votes won't be counted towards the Tally Participation Rate, as detailed in the following links:\n> 1.

They must post using the template provided below, within a 7-day application window.\n\n**Incentive Program Confirmation Template:**\n* Forum Username (Link):\n* Twitter Profile (Link):\n* Snapshot Profile (Link):\n* Tally Profile with Exact All-time Participation Rate % (Link):\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Failing to send a confirmation message will exclude you from the incentive system, regardless of eligibility.\n> * Applicants should ensure accuracy in numbers and links, facilitating quicker verification.\n\n**Eligible delegates for the incentive program will be announced on the forum.**\n\n## Scoring and Framework\n\nTo determine which delegates will be paid on a monthly basis, we will use a point system and a framework that will be made public.\n\n![scores.png](ipfs://bafybeieuu4yypwmkapdkznz4arvsci7t7ond4a7qh55us2fuz5ijjbhwsa)\n    \n[Framework - Experimental Incentive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862)\n\n### Details: Terminology, Symbols, and Formulas\n\nWe explain in detail the framework and points system:\n\n* **Delegates (DD):** Delegates with right to access to incentives\n* **Ranking (TOP):** Delegate's position in this Dune table https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power\n* **Funds ARB (FARB):** The amount of ARB allocated per month to the delegates' payment\n* **Activity Weight (%):** Represents the weight assigned to each key activity to be measured in delegates.\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20:** Percentage of the total participation of the member in votes. This parameter is extracted from Tally. This is the only parameter that is not reset monthly.\n    * **PR% formula: (PR * 20) / 100**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15:** Percentage of delegate participation in snapshot voting. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to snapshots for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted on in the month.\n    * **SV% formula: (SV(Tn) /SV(Fn)) * 15**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25:** Percentage of delegate participation in on-chain voting in Tally. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Number of total proposals that were sent to Tally for voting in the month.\n    * **Rn:** Number of proposals the delegate voted in Tally in the month.\n    * **TV% formula: (TV(Fn) - TV(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25:** Percentage of communication threads with the justification of the delegate's vote on the proposals sent to snapshots and Tally (if necessary if the vote does not change). This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of proposals that were submitted to a vote.\n    * **Rn:** Number of real communication rational threads where the delegate communicated and justified his/her decision.\n    * **CR% formula: (CR(Fn) - CR(Rn)) * 25**\n  * **Commenting Proposals (CP) - Weight 15:** Percentage of proposals where the delegate asked questions or generated important discussion for the advancement of the proposal. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month.\n    * **Tn:** Total number of formal proposals posted on the forum.\n    * **Rn:** Number of actual proposals where the delegate made a genuine and quality contribution. Spam messages will not be considered.\n    * **CP% formula: (CP(Fn) - CP(Rn)) * 15**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP:** This parameter is extra. If the delegate makes a significant contribution to the DAO, he/she is automatically granted +40% extra TP. This parameter is at the discretion of the program administrator. This parameter is reset at the beginning of each month\n\n* **Total Participation (TP):** Sum of the results of activities performed by the delegate. A TP% of 100 indicates full participation.\n  * **TP% formula: PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n* **Payment ARB (PARB):** Final amount of ARB that the delegate will receive based on his TP% and his position in the table.\n  * **PARB formula: IF(TP% >=100; 50000 ;(5000 * TP% / 100))**\n\n#### Parameter summary\n\n* **Activity Weight (%):**\n  * **Participation Rate (PR) - Weight 20%**\n  * **Snapshot Voting (SV) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Tally Voting (TV) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Communicating Rationale (CR) - Weight 25%**\n  * **Commenting on Proposals (CP) - Weight 15%**\n  * **Bonus Point (BP) - Extra +30% TP (Total Participation)**\n* **Total Participation (TP):**\n  * **TP = PR% + SV% + TV% + CR% + CP% + BP**\n\n### Weight and activity considerations\n\nThe activities that have been considered in shaping the framework and scope are measurable activities that we believe can positively impact governance.\n\nWe have distributed the weight according to the type of activity, as we believe this is the fairest way to do it at the moment.\n\n**Surely both the activities and the weightings are far from being the final parameters, ideally after these 6 months we should have a clear idea of how to modify certain parameters or which ones to add/remove.**\n\n> **Note:**\n> We have not included the governance call in the list of activities because we feel that it may be difficult for delegates in different time zones to attend because of the specific timing of the call. Plus some delegates might not want to dox their voices.\n\n\n### Total Participation (TP)\n\nThe 50 delegates who conclude the month with a **TP score of +60%** will be the ones to receive incentives based on the result provided by the **PARB** parameter.\n\nShould more than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only the top 50 scores will be selected.\n\nIf fewer than 50 delegates have a **TP score of +60%**, only those meeting the criteria will be compensated\n\n> **Note:**\n> In the exceptional circumstance where scores are identical or more than 50 delegates exceed +90%, the entire month's budget may be distributed amongst all delegates with such scores. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\n### Bonus Point\n\nShould a delegate propose or actively participate in an enhancement proposal for Arbitrum DAO and execute it, like the [Arbitrum’s Short-Term Incentive Program (Arbitrum Improvement Proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-short-term-incentive-program-arbitrum-improvement-proposal/16131)), they will be granted an additional +30% to their TP score for making a valuable contribution to the DAO. This could also be a governance process enhancement proposal or a template for grant selection.\n\nWe understand that this is one of the weakest points of the proposal and we believe it is very objective. To assess this point we will try to answer these questions\n\n- Is the proposal of interest to the ArbitrumDAO, does it cover any vertical that has not yet been worked on?\n- Is the proposal well described, does it have details of the objectives it wants to achieve?\n- Does the proposal generate debate among delegates, is there interest among DAO members (for or against) about the proposal?\n- Does the proposer exhaust existing resources to demonstrate that their proposal adds value to ArbitrumDAO (governance calls, responds in the governance forum, etc).\n- Was the proposal put to a vote: was it a close vote or a resounding no? \n\nWhen evaluating the bonus points we will try to answer these questions and the administrator will have to upload a post to the forum with the answer and a justification of why he/she grants the bonus point. We also look forward to hearing the community's opinion on the matter.\n\n### Parameter Snapshot\n\nWhen we refer to a month, we consider from the first day of the month 00:00 UTC to the last day 23:59hs UTC of each month. Within these days and hours, delegates have the opportunity to perform all actions to meet the parameters. The month's activities conclude on the last day of the month, so delegates must be punctual.\n\n### Delegate Responsibilities\n\nDelegates are responsible for keeping track of their actions. At the end of the month, they have until the 3rd of the following month to submit a forum post with the following requirements:\n\n* A copy (Link) of the framework with their activity data for that month.\n* Additionally, the post must have a summary with all the links including:\n  * Snapshot voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the reasoning behind the snapshot vote\n  * Tally voting link\n  * Forum post link explaining the tally vote reasoning (if you have changed your vote)\n  * Commenting on Proposals link (only those that went to snapshots)\n* The summary should also include:\n  * Delegate proposal links\n  * Links to any significant contribution (discussion, questions, suggestions, etc.) made to a proposal.\n\n> **Note:**\n> * Delegates failing to post the requested information will not receive incentives.\n> * To avoid forum spam and disarray, we will ask the facilitators to add a channel for the incentive system so delegates can input all their information there.\n\n### Incentive System Administrator Responsibilities\n\nAfter the delegates post and present their results in the framework, the incentive system administrator has 10 days to gather all the information, review, verify, and unify it. Then, present all the unified data on the forum in the [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTRXhxcw3o8RJYWw0Nvf48Ak0ihOe5kUJUcTWH0IDgg/edit#gid=374367862) and attach a summary explaining that month's final result.\n\nOnce the final result is presented, delegates have 2 days to file a claim in case of disagreement.\n\n#### Dispute\n\nDelegates have a 2-day window to dispute if they disagree with the results presented by the Incentive System Administrator.\n\nTo raise a dispute, they must do so via a forum post with the following template:\n\n* Title: Dispute\n* Username\n* Reason for dispute (be detailed)\n\nThe system administrator must promptly address the issue, resolving it within a maximum of 2 days.\n\n#### Incentive System Ban\n\nShould a delegate or any community member attempt to deceive or game the incentive system, they will be banned. This decision is at the discretion of the program administrator.\n\nWe must remember that this system is experimental, and we hope for community members' cooperation for its success. \n\n### Payment Execution\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the delegate payments are expected to be sent as a proposal to Tally, with full details of the payments, between the 16th and 17th. This will be repeated for the 6 months, so that the DAO has control over the incentive program and can cut it off whenever it wants.\n\n**Payments are made in ARB tokens.**\n\n#### Considerations\n\nLike every new and experimental system, there may be delays, so please be [patient](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lll5H9ekrsQPe7zMbvkiWTIzevlwpSJLkQql8B8UhTA/edit#gid=0).\n\nEstimated schedule:\n\n![schedule.png](ipfs://bafkreie7nlxyh7jx7myxgfj6eqogu6p7kfebmokq3v5fvxzskmmb7j2h64)\n    \n### Administrator Perspective\n\n1. Start of the month: Track delegate participation in governance.\n2. Last day of the month: Begin collecting delegate posts from the forum.\n3. Review all the information, check for accuracy, and compile it into the framework.\n4. Establish the results within the given timeframe.\n5. If everyone agrees, send a proposal to Tally with the payment details, to be voted on.\n6. Keep the DAO informed\n\n## Incentive system administrator\n\nGiven the short duration of the program and the lack of a DAO Facilitator, SEED Latam is willing to assume the administration of this program. This means that our delegation won't participate in it and that the adminstration won't be carried out by myself, but by the organization SEED Latam.\n\nHowever, we're also open to a group of delegates or potentially a third party administering this program, in which case we would obviously provide any assistance necessary.\n\nFor the adminstration of said program the budget would be 25,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator.\n\n---\n\n# **Option 2 - Karma automation for delegate incentive program**\n\n### Features summary\n\nKarma will develop features to enhance administrator efficiency and provide transparency to the Arbitrum community. The features that will be built include:\n\n1. Automated fetching of all delegates with Voting Power (VP) over 50k, along with their details.\n2. Profile display for each delegate, showing their voting history and voting reasons they post on Snapshot, Tally or Forum.\n3. Calculation and display of PR, SV, TV, CR, CP (TBD if CP can be automated) for each delegate as specified in the proposal.\n**Karma will implement automatically fetching delegates’ forum data**\n4. Functionality for the Administrator to allocate Bonus Points.\n5. Computation and presentation of the final Total Points (TP) and PARBB for each delegate on: `arbitrum.karmahq.xyz/delegate-compensation`.\n\n**This automation eliminates the need for delegates to manually report their monthly activities.**\n\n### Timeline\n\n- **Week 1:** Collaborating with administrators and community members to finalize the project requirements.\n- **Weeks 2 and 3:** Initiating the sprint to design and develop all the features\n- **Week 4:** The product will undergo comprehensive end-to-end testing and be deployed to production. At this stage, the community will gain full access to all features.\n- **Week 5 and Beyond:** Implementation of bug fixes and enhancements based on insights and feedback gathered.\n\n### Payment Schedule\n\n- **Payment 1:** 10k ARB when the proposal passes and the project is kicked off.\n- **Payment 2:** 10K ARB on successful launch of the product (After week 4 per the timeline above)\n- **Payment 3:** 10K ARB 2 months after launch as we continue to fix bugs and make enhancements (week 12 of program kickoff)\n\n**Karma payments will also be executed from the DAO and tracked by the program administrator.**\n\n### Cost\n\n- 30000 ARB\n\n\n## **SEED Latam Commitment**\n\nSeed Latam is committed to monitoring the proper functioning of Karma and collecting feedback from the community on the dashboard's performance. We also commit to collaborating with Karma so that the dashboard meets the needs of the incentive system.\n\nAs with Option 1, we are also open to having a group of delegates or potentially a third party administer Karma's progress and the program, in which case we would obviously provide all necessary assistance.\n\nFor the administration of the program for this option the budget would be 20,000 ARB. This payment will also be divided into 6 months and will be sent in the proposal to Tally along with the payments to the delegates. In this way the DAO will have control over the administrator. \n\n### Disclaimer\n\nSEED Latam does not have any commercial relationship with Karma nor does it receive any payment from them for incorporating them into this proposal.\n\nThe only link between SEED Latam and Karma is that both want the success of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# Overview\n\nProposal overview\n\n**Duration of the incentive system**\n* 6 month\n\n**Total Number of Delegates to Receive Incentives**\n\n* 50 delegates\n\n**Selection process**\n\n* **Voting Power**: >50K ARB, corresponding to 194 delegates. (Source:[ Arbitrum Delegates and Voting Power - Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/pandajackson42/arbitrum-delegates-and-voting-power)).\n* **Delegates to Receive Incentives**: 50.\n* **Budget Allocation**: 1,500,000 ARB (5,000 ARB per delegate per month).\n* **Historical Participation Rate (Tally)**: Over 25%\n\n*Eligible delegates must confirm their participation in the incentive system by posting a message on the forum.*\n\n## CONT IN FORUM POST",

        "body": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power \n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay \n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1) The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n2. The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n\nIncreasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n\nOn the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n2) The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n\n3) The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 6 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n**RFC -** January 11th to January 18th\n\n**Snapshot -** January 18th to January 25th\n\n**On-Chain Vote:** January 30th to February 13th\n\n**Execution Delay:**\n\n- February 13th to February 16th - L2 Waiting Period\n- February 16th to February 23rd - L2-to-L1 Message\n- February 23rd to February 27th - L1 Waiting Period\n\n**Please note the aforementioned timeline is tentative and the actual timeline might be slightly different.**",

        "body": "## **Summary**\n\nAs we near the end of allocating the initial grant budget (link to proposal), where through the [Arbitrum Grants Program ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/) run via the Delegated Domain Allocation model by Questbook, $912k has already been allocated to over 60 proposals. Based on the overwhelming response and number of quality proposals the grant program has received, we propose to start a new program for the Arbitrum Grants via DDA through Questbook with a budget of $4,000,000 spread across 4 domains over the next two quarters. We have received great feedback and support from the community, builders, and domain allocators for requesting additional budget and continue funding projects through the delegated domain allocation model.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from Arbitrum DDA program, we propose renewing the Program with a budget of $4M for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Arbitrum’s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the same domains as the previous program:\n\n|Domain|Domain Allocator|Proposed Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|New Protocol Ideas|Jojo|$920,000|\n|Gaming|Adam|$920,000|\n|Dev Tooling|Juandi|$920,000|\n|Education, Growth, Community and Events|Cattin (Seed Latam)|$920,000|\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1. New Protocol Ideas - [Link ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/120s88WVycDyP2pUfgcT0eE8ILuribuayHDnd5aeZxbM/edit#heading=h.4th1bgre9sv4)\n2. Gaming - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt)\n3. Dev Tooling - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit)\n4. Education, Growth, Community and Events - [Link](https://www.notion.so/e8e86fbd9ee349beb0d9046607dae812?pvs=21)\n\n* We propose increasing the allocated grants budget for all domains equally to a higher budget based on the number of proposals received in the previous round.\n* Additionally, in the first round we set a soft cap of $25,000, and we propose increasing the cap to $50,000, with a few more steps for approving a grant that is larger than $25,000, requiring the involvement of two DAs to approve a proposal rather than just the specific domain allocator.\n* Considering the previous softcap being half of what is currently proposed, and that for an average of $220,000 for each domain the program was able to run for around 3.5 months before being maxed out, we project that providing 4X the amount of the previous iteration to each domain should allow the program to constantly allocate, at the same rate or even higher, for the full 6 months projected duration\n* The increased cap will allow the Questbook Program to keep covering the bootstrap belt of grant between $1,000 to $25,000 while, at the same time, be able to serve larger protocols that inherently might have larger needs.\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in the initial program, the renewed grants program will be run using **[Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model 1](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/)**. Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community.\n\nWhile the program has produced, accordingly to preliminary conversation with protocols and delegates, good results, we want to address and integrate the feedbacks so far proposed and partially covered in the previous section, such as:\n\n* have better accountability for the increased soft cap\n* define a more robust and structured set of rules for applicants, in regards to providing a timeline for their project(s)\n* define a cost for the management and verification of milestones after the program is completed\n* define a plan to manage the volatility of funds being distributed by the DAO in ARB token.\n\nThe DA will evaluate all the proposals through the rubrics provided for each domain, with the following framework:\n\n* in case of request below or equal to $25,000, the evaluation process will be the same of the previous iteration, with rubrics being evaluated and scored by the specific DA\n* in case of request above $25,000, and below the new soft cap of $50,000, the evaluation will involve a second DA, chosen by the first one based on the proximity of the specific expertise and knowledge to that proposal, that will have to publish a second evaluation of the rubrics alongside the score. Assuming N rubrics, scored from 1 to 5, the grant will be approved only if both the DA will give each a scoring equal or above to N*3.\n\nThe disbursement of the grant will take place on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject the application based on evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and 4 domain allocators will be setup. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator. The funds for the grants program will flow from the treasury into the Grants SAFE. This SAFE will hold the funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds that will be disbursed to the proposers will reside in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter the end of two quarters, the grants committee and the Arbitrum community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to eventually, renew the program and, if so, change any specification of the domains, the domain allocators or the program manager.\n\nTo ensure predictability of the funding of the program and a proper runaway, upon receiving the amount from the DAO, the DAs alongside the PM will convert it in stables. If the protocols request it, specific grants or milestones might be paid in $ARB by converting the needed amount at the moment of payout.\n\nArbitrum DDA program closed accepting new proposals from mid February. If the program will be renewed in the terms above, the DDA program will take care, alongside the evaluation of new proposal, to keep evaluating the milestones of the previous program, thus allowing for the continuity of the previous iteration in an accountable way for grantees.\n\n### Compensation\n\nWe propose the following payment structure for the PM and DAs, with a base salary of $100/h and an increased projected workload of DA by 33% compared to the previous program, in consideration of the fact that DA not only have on average worked more than what initially was expected in the previous program, but also that they will need to spend time to cross evaluate all proposals above $25,000. On the other hand, the compensation of the PM is instead unchanged.\nWe are also adding overhead for an extra 6 months, equivalent to 20% of full-time salaries, for the Domain Allocators and the PM to keep evaluating the milestones of the grantees after the natural end of the program. This will ensure the proper continuation of the program and the followup with grantees, despite the program potentially not being renewed if so decided by the DAO. In case the program would be renewed with the same structure and people, or in case the milestone verification would come to an end before the due time, any leftover would be given back to the Arbitrum DAO.\n\n|Role|Monthly Cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Program Manager and Questbook|$10000|$60,000*|\n|Domain Allocator|$8000|$192,000|\n|Overhead for extra 6 months|$8400|$50,400|\n|Operations Cost, Misc.||$10,000|\n||Totals:|$312,400|\n\n*Note: Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month, included in the numbers above with the PM’s payment.\n\nAs per the above, the current costs to run program would be 7.8% of the overall budget of the grant program.\n\n* We suggest that the grants committee continue with [Synapse ](https://www.synaps.io/) for KYC services and [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in) for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout the Arbitrum DDA program 1.\n* However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Arbitrum at the end of two quarters.\n\n### Read the whole proposal on the forum for Domain Allocator roles, responsibilities, KPIs, and Expectations",

        "body": "Category: Constitutional - Process\nAs part of its governance, the Arbitrum DAO incorporates a Security Council that can take certain emergency and non-emergency actions:\n\nSection 3 of the Constitution 10 describes this council in more detail.\nInitial Setup Transparency Report 3 details the current members of the council.\nSection 4 on the Constitution outlines an election process that will replace six security council members every six months.\nThe first election to replace the first cohort of Security Council Members is expected to begin on the 15th September.\n\nExecutive summary\nThis vote relates to the enactment of the Arbitrum Security Council elections.\nA smart contract system has been developed to enable on-chain voting. That system is final and under multiple security audits.\nThis vote is meant to temperature check with the DAO both the process that will be conducted for the elections, as well as the smart contract system that will enable them.\nA successful vote will lead to an on-chain proposal that updates the constitution text with the new sections below, as well as the new Security Council election system being activated within the broader Arbitrum governance architecture.\nImplementation Status\nThe code representing the proposed architecture is currently under audit and is available for full review in: GitHub - ArbitrumFoundation/governance at c18de53820c505fc459f766c1b224810eaeaabc5.\n\nThe work has already been audited by Trail of Bits and the identified issues have been patched in, the full audit report will be made available in the codebase soon. A Code4Rena audit competition has also been commissioned for the election system and can be viewed at Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production\n\nBackground\nAn overview of the election process as described by the Constitution alongside the process for how to enact a code change to Arbitrum’s smart contract suite:\n\nConstitution of the Arbitrum DAO 2 (esp. sections 3 10 and 4) - As noted above, this proposal seeks to enact what is already described in the Constitution.\nDAO Governance Architecture 5 - The proposed architecture makes use of a number of existing governance components.\nAn understanding of the following smart contract suites will help the reader evaluate this proposal as it re-uses several components:\n\nOpen Zeppelin Governor - The proposed architecture inherits a number of OpenZeppelin contracts.\nGnosis Modules 1 - Each of the security councils is a Gnosis Safe, and updating members of the security council is handled via adding Gnosis modules.\nHigh-level Election Overview\nThe Constitution specifies that membership of the Security Council is split into two cohorts. Every 6 months, all positions in a single cohort are put up for election.\n\nThe proposed election implementation, which must adhere to the specification laid out in the Constitution, is split into:\n\nElection stages: The process for selecting and voting for nominees.\nUpdate stages: Installing the newly elected cohort into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\nThe election process and update stages are performed via on-chain smart contracts. A brief overview of each stage includes:\n\nElection Stages\nProcess for selecting and voting for the new cohort of Security council members.\n\nNominee selection (7 days). Candidates must gain 0.2% of total votable tokens in order to make it to the next step.\nCompliance check by Foundation (14 days). As dictated in the Constitution, the selected nominees must undergo a compliance check to ensure they comply with the legal requirements, service agreements, and additional rules dictated by the Constitution.\nMember election (21 days). Votes are cast and the top 6 nominees are selected.\nUpdate Stages\nProcess to install the newly elected cohort of Security Council members into the Arbitrum smart contracts.\n\nSecurity Council manager update (0 days). The manager is the source of truth for specifying who are the current council members. It processes the election result and takes note on who will be the new security council members.\nL2 timelock + withdrawal + L1 timelock (3 + 7 + 3 days). All actions that directly affect the core Arbitrum contracts must go through a series of timelocks to protect the right for all users to exit. This is a built-in safety mechanism for users who are unhappy with the approved changes.\nIndividual council update (0 days). Once the updates have passed through the relevant timelocks, the Security Council manager can install the security council members. This requires updating 4 Gnosis Safe smart contracts that are controlled by the Security Council members.\nSecurity Council Election Flow\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2bk2mmknletnshsvxbohkbszppbkb3wdntpnraj7x2gwgx2rgqq)\n    \nElection Stages in detail\n1. Nominee selection (7 days)\nThis stage consists of handling election timing, candidate registration, candidate endorsement:\n\nElection creation. Elections can be created by anyone, but only every 6 months. The election alternates between targeting the positions on the two cohorts. Once created, this first stage of the election process lasts for 7 days.\nCandidate registration. During these 7 days, any candidate can register, unless they are already a member of the other cohort. Members of the current cohort (the cohort up for election) are allowed to register for re-election.\nEndorsing candidates. Delegates can endorse a candidate during this 7 day window. A single delegate can split their vote across multiple candidates. No candidate can accrue more than 0.2% of all votable tokens.\nFallback in case of too few candidates. In the event that fewer than 6 candidates receive a 0.2% endorsement, outgoing members of the cohort up for election will be selected to make up to 6 candidates.\nImplementation details\nThe nominee selection process is implemented by the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\n\nIt inherits most of its functionality from the Open Zeppelin Governor contracts and we have extended it with an extra feature:\n\nCustom counting module to allow delegates to endorse multiple candidates.\nThe governor contract has the following characteristics:\n\nA new proposal is created each election cycle, with an identifier unique to that election cycle.\nCandidates can the put themselves forward by calling addContender.\nDelegates can call castVoteWithReasonAndParams, supplying custom arguments in the params to indicate which candidate they wish to endorse with what weight.\n2. Compliance check by the Foundation(14 days)\nThe Foundation will be given 14 days to vet the prospective nominees. If they find that a candidate does not meet the compliance check, they can exclude the candidate from progressing to the next stage. Note that grounds for exclusion could include greater than 3 members of a given organisation being represented in the nominee set (as described in section 4 of the Constitution).\n\nImplementation details\nThe foundation can exclude a nominee by:\n\nCalling a custom excludeNominee function on the same SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor contract.\nThe Governor smart contract enforces the 2 week time period and the Foundation must exclude nominees by this deadline.\n\nOnce the compliance check has completed:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to proceed to the member election stage.\nIf there are less than 6 eligible nominees, then the Foundation will consult with outgoing members of the cohort on whether they will continue in this role for another 12 months. Members of the existing cohort may be selected at random to fill the remaining seats.\n\n3. Member election (21 days)\nThe voting process can begin once a set of compliant candidates have been successfully nominated.\n\nThe voting process is designed to encourage voters to cast their vote early. Their voting power will eventually decay if they do not cast their vote within the first 7 days:\n\n0 - 7 days. Votes cast will carry weight 1 per token\n7 - 21 days. Votes cast will have their weight linearly decreased based on the amount of time that has passed since the 7 day point. By the 21st day, each token will carry a weight of 0.\nAdditionally, delegates can cast votes for more than one nominee:\n\nSplit voting. delegates can split their tokens across multiple nominees, with 1 token representing 1 vote.\nImplementation details\nThe Security Council member election will take place in a separate SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract which will also inherit from Open Zeppelin Governor contracts.\n\nAfter the 14 day waiting period for the compliance check, anyone can trigger a new member election:\n\nCall the execute function in SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor to deploy a new election proposal for SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor\nThe SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor includes:\n\nA custom counting module that allows delegates to split their vote and accounts for the linear decrease in voting weight.\nThese additional parameters are supplied as the params argument when calling castVoteWithReasonAndParams.\nThe custom counting module also checks that the nominee being voted is a compliant one by checking against the compliant nominee list in the SecurityCouncilNomineeElectionGovernor.\nAt the end of the 21 days of election:\n\nAnyone can call the execute function on the SecurityCouncilMemberElectionGovernor contract to initiate the update of top 6 nominees with the most votes into SecurityCouncilManager.\nUpdate stages in detail\n1. Security Council manager update\nThe security council manager is a contract which contains the canonical list of security council members, and which cohort they are part of. When a member election completes, the manager updates its local list of the current cohorts then forms cross chain messages to propagate those updates to each of the Security Council Gnosis safes.\n\nThe manager also provides some additional functionality to allow the security council to:\n\nRemove a member: As described in the Constitution, the council can remove one of its own members. The DAO can also remove a member under special conditions described by the Constitution.\nAdd a member: After removing a member, the council can add a member\nAddress rotation: As a practical matter, a council member can rotate one of their own keys. This can only be done with the approval of at least 9/12 council members as well as explicit approval from the member carrying out the rotation.\nImplementation details\nThe manager functionality is contained within a custom SecurityCouncilManager smart contract. Since the SecurityCouncilManager is indirectly able to make calls to the standard UpgradeExecutor contracts which have far reaching powers, special care must be take to ensure the manager only makes council member updates.\n\nCalling the UpgradeExecutors on each of the chains requires navigating withdrawals transactions, timelocks and inboxes, the SecurityCouncilManager outsources the calldata creation for these routes to a UpgradeExecRouteBuilder contract.\n\n2. Timelocks and withdrawal\nConstitutional DAO proposals all pass through:\n\nL2 timelock (3 days),\nL2 → L1 withdrawal (~7 days),\nL1 timelock (3 days).\nYou can read more about these stages in the governance docs 1. The purpose of these delays is to ensure that users wishing to withdraw their assets before the proposal is executed will have the time to do so. Changing the Security Council members should also provide this guarantee, so after the election has completed and before the Security Councils are updated the update message also goes through these same stages. The update message will use the existing timelocks to enforce these delays.\n\nImplementation details\nThe existing governance timelock contracts are used as part of this flow.\n\nThe SecurityCouncilManager is given the PROPOSER role on the L2 timelock enabling it to create messages that will eventually be received by each UpgradeExecutor.\n\n3. Individual council updates\nThe new Security Council members need to be installed into 4 Gnosis safes:\n\nArbitrum One 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nArbitrum One 7 of 12 Non-Emergency Security Council\nEthereum 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nNova 9 of 12 Emergency Security Council\nThe old cohort of members will be removed, and the new cohort will replace them.\n\nImplementation details\nTo do this the existing Upgrade Executor contracts on each chain will be installed as Gnosis Safe modules into the Security Council safes. A custom Governance Action Contract 2 will be used to call the specific OwnerManager addOwnerWithThreshold and removeOwner methods on the Gnosis safes.\n\nAdditional affordances\nThe Constitution also declares some other additional affordances to certain parties\n\nThe DAO can vote to remove a member prior to the end of their term, as long as 10% of possible votes are cast in favour and 5/6 of cast votes are in favour. This will be implemented as a governor with correct quorum and proposal passed thresholds. This governor will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can remove a member prior to the end of their term, if 9 of 12 members agree. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call removeMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nThe Security Council can add a member once one has been removed, if 9 of 12 members agree and if there are less than 12 members currently on the council. The 9 of 12 council will be given the rights to call addMember on the SecurityCouncilManager.\nConstitution Updates\nThe proposed implementation mostly satisfies the specification outlined by the Arbitrum Constitution. There are some minor changes that are required to the Constitution’s text to take into account the time it takes to install new candidates and to support compliance procedures set out by the Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nNote, the final wording for how to update the Constitution will be provided in a later revision. We simply want to notify the requirement that the text needs to be changed. At this stage, our request for feedback is focused on the implementation details of the smart contract suite.\n\nUpdate timeline for the election\nThe Section 4 of the Constitution contains the text:\n\nFrom T until T+7 days: Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nFrom T+7 days until T+28 days: Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+14 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+14 days and T+28 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+14 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+28 days.\n\nAt T+28 days: The 6 candidates who have received the most votes are elected and immediately join the Council, replacing the Cohort that was up for re-election.\n\nWe need to make three changes to the Arbitrum Constitution:\n\nNew timeline. A dedicated compliance process must be included between the nominee selection and member election phases. This will shift the timeline of events and the total election will now last at least 42 days alongside additional time to install the newly elected Security Council members via the on-chain governance smart contracts.\nLess than 6 eligible nominees. The Arbitrum Foundation has the authority to add new nominees during the Compliance stage if there are less than 6 eligible nominees.\nInstallation time. We need to remove the phrase ‘immediately join the Council’ to take into account the on-chain governance process for installing the newly elected candidates. For example, the various time locks to protect a user’s right to exit Arbitrum during the upgrade and the time it takes to send an L2 → L1 message.\nWith the above in mind, we propose an update to Section 4 of the Constitution with the following text:\n\nNominee selection (T until T+7 days): Any DAO member may declare their candidacy for the Security Council; provided that a current Security Council member in one cohort may not be a candidate for a seat in the other cohort. To the extent that there are more than six candidates, each eligible candidate must be supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens.\n\nCompliance process (T+7 until T+21 days): All candidates will cooperate with The Arbitrum Foundation and complete the compliance process. The Arbitrum Foundation is responsible for removing any candidates that fail the compliance process. In the event that fewer than six candidates are supported by pledged votes representing at least 0.2% of all Votable Tokens, the current Security Council members whose seats are up for election may become candidates (as randomly selected out of their Cohort) until there are 6 candidates.\n\nMember election (T+21 until T+42 days): Each DAO member or delegate may vote for any declared candidate. Each token may be cast for one candidate. Votes cast before T+28 days will have 100% weight. Votes cast between T+28 days and T+42 days will have weight based on the time of casting, decreasing linearly with time, with 100% weight at T+28 days, decreasing linearly to 0% weight at T+42 days.\n\nAt T+42 days: The process for replacing the cohort of Security Council members with the 6 candidates who received the most votes will be activated. The installation process must be executed via the on-chain governance smart contracts and it may take several days until the new Security Council members are installed.\n\n\nWe propose to update the Constitution with the following text:\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation is allocated 14 days for the Compliance process and it should be executed between the Nominee selection and Member election. The Arbitrum Foundation has flexibility to update its compliance policy for every new election. This is required to allow The Arbitrum Foundation to comply with Cayman Island laws. Furthermore, The Arbitrum Foundation maintains the right to issue new procedures and guidelines for off-chain components of the Security Council election. All efforts should be made by The Arbitrum Foundation to ensure an orderly, fair, and transparent election.\nFinal update to the Constitution text.\nFor completeness, the amended text for Section 4 of the Arbitrum Constitution, including the changes from AIP-4:\n\nThe Security Council has 12 members, who are divided into two Cohorts of 6 members.\n\nThe initial Security Council Cohorts were determined by randomly splitting the 12 members into two 6-member cohorts - 6 members in the ‘First Cohort’ and 6 members in the ‘Second Cohort’. The members of the initial Security Council Cohorts are detailed in a transparency report  linked in the discussion",
