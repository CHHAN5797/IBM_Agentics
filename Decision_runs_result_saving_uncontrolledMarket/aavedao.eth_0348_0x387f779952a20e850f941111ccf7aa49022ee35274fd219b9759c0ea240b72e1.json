        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC]  Retroactive bug bounties proposal (pre-Immunefi)\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nRequest for bounties pending from before the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi official bug bounty program, amounting a grand total of $86’500.\n\n**The objective of this ARFC is to pre-authorise such payments, to be processed via an on-chain AIP**\n\n## Motivation\n\nBefore the setup of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty program on [September 25th 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), security reports by white hats where evaluated in an ad-hoc basis, proposing bounties/rewards following an approach like on [this proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077). That was not optimal, as there was no formal scope defined, or strict ranges of bounties depending on severity and impact.\n\nCurrently, every report is being processed via Immunefi and the rules of the Aave program, however, there were other reports submitted via other channel before that (usually security@aave.com). As these reports should be evaluated at time of submission for fairness, and outside of the Immunefi scope defined afterwards, we think it is a good idea to reward them separately and retro-actively outside the program.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Reports\n\nFirst of all, we want to clarify certain aspects for the community:\n\n- The proposed rewards and evaluation metrics follow the ones we did ad-hoc in the past [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-bug-bounties-proposal/13077#clarification-on-evaluation-2), as we don’t think it is fair for the white-hats to apply the rewards ranges on the current Immunefi program and out-of-scope rules, as they were defined afterwards.\n- In one of the cases, we recommended the white hat to submit the report via Immunefi, in order to have access to the mediation procedure of the platform. As this mediation process was finally requested by the white hat, Immunefi charges the corresponding fee of 10% of the amount, which we think is legitimate.\n- At the moment, *we are not disclosing the full details of some of the reports*, because even if none of them create any risk for Aave now, one has dependencies with another report (not disclosed yet) and the other could increase risk to non-Aave entities.\n\n\n### 1. Inconsistent validation on  Aave v2/v3\n\nWhen calling `borrow()` with stable rate mode on Aave v2 and v3, one of the validations is that not more than a percentage of the total available liquidity can be borrowed at once.\n\nHowever, `swapBorrowRateMode()` doesn’t validate the same, which is unexpected and could lead to more stable rate borrowings than intended.\n\nIt is important to highlight that this is not possible at the moment, with minting of stable rate disabled.\n\n\n**Severity:  Low**\n\nThe issue didn’t create any immediate problem in the protocol, but overexposure to stable rate mode is not expected.\n\n**Likelihood:  Certain**\n\nThis problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.\n\n**Proposed bounty:** 10’000 USD\n\n---\n\n### 2. Inconsistent HF (Health Factor) behaviour swap borrow rate mode\n\nWhen swapping borrow rate mode, the HF of an user is not validated, as debt should remain the same. However, under edge scenarios, the HF of an user could slightly change (by ~1 unit of lowest asset’s decimals).\n\n\n**Severity:  No impact**\n\nThis is not a bug or creates any exploit scenario, but it is unexpected behaviour.\n\n**Likelihood:  Certain**\n\nThis problem was present on the deployed versions of Aave v2 and v3, on those assets with stable rate enabled.\n\n**Proposed bounty:** 5’000 USD\n\n---\n\n### 3. Price manipulation of asset listed on Aave\n\nBy executing a complex strategy (involving compromising the asset’s trusted infrastructure), it could be possible to inflate the price of one of the assets listed on Aave v2.\n\nEven if this belongs more to the centralisation risk of the asset, and we don’t consider a bug of the protocol, it was taken into account for off-boarding consideration of the asset by risk providers of Aave, and we believe it is fair to reward retro-actively.\n\nAs this risk still exist on the asset itself and more protocols could be using it, even if we don’t really see any immediate risk, we will not be disclosing at the moment details of it, until the team applies extra measures.\n\n\n**Severity:  Critical**\n\nBeing a price manipulation, the impact on the protocol would hypotetically be important.\n\n**Likelihood: Not likely**\n\nThe attack involves compromising asset’s infrastructure (which would directly disqualify on the current Aave <> Immunefi program), together with extra techniques; so we consider it theoretically possible, but highly improbable.\n\n**Proposed bounty:** 65’000 USD. Additionally, 6’500 USD as Immunefi fee.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIf this ARFC is positive, afterwards we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal, releasing the funds to the corresponding addresses.",

        "body": "shortDescription: Add LDO to Ethereum Aave v3 deployment as collateral, with borrowing enabled.\nauthor: [Token Logic](https://twitter.com/Token_Logic) via [Llama](https://twitter.com/llama)\ndated: 2023-03-26\n\n# Summary\n\nThis ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add LDO to the Ethereum V3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nLDO would be the first Ethereum liquid staking protocol governance token to be listed on Aave. Aave would benefit from being the first major lending market to list LDO. Users will be able to express various trading views on LDO’s price outlook in the lead up to Shanghai.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLido is a suite of software protocols that facilitates liquid staking across multiple blockchains. The Lido DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation. The LDO token is used to vote on the use of the DAO treasury associated with the protocols, research and development, and incentive programs.\n\nThe Lido DAO is an Aragon organization. The LDO token was created using an [Aragon Minime contract](https://aragon.org/dao). Since Aragon provides a full end-to-end framework to build DAOs, Lido DAO uses its standard tools.\n\nLDO Token Ethereum Address: `0x5a98fcbea516cf06857215779fd812ca3bef1b32`\n\nLDO is a Top 50 token by market cap, currently ranked [36th](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lido-dao) by Coingecko. Lido Protocol is the largest minter of liquid staked ETH tokens with [4,917,554 ETH staked](https://lido.fi/ethereum).\n\nMaking LDO available on Aave v3 would make Aave V3 the first major lending market to do so and would benefit from the first mover advantage.\n\nCurrently, stETH is listed on Aave v2 and wstETH is listed on the Aave v3 Ethereum liquidity pools. wstETH has also been approved by Aave Governance for being listed on the Optimism, Arbitrum and hopefully the Polygon v3 liquidity pools. Lido DAO would like to also propose to include the Lido governance token, LDO.\n\n[Add wstETH on v3 Optimism](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-wsteth-to-aave-v3-on-optimism/10932)\n[Add wstETH on v3 Arbitrum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-arbitrum-aave-v3/11387)\n[Add wstETH on v3 Polygon](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-polygon-v3/12266)\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum. \n\nThe parameters shown below are a combined recommendation of Gauntlet and Chaos Labs. It can be found here, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-support-for-ldo-on-ethereum-v3/12045/5).\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|Yes|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (LDO)|6,000,000|\n|Borrow Cap (LDO)|3,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|$7,500,000|\n|LTV|40.00%|\n|LT|50.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus| 9.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee |10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n\nIf an LDO/USD oracle is required for v3, then a [Chainlink Synchronicity Price Adapter](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-generalised-price-sync-adapters/11416) could be used. \n\nThe below details the two relevant Chainlink oracles:\n\nLDO/ETH: 0x4e844125952D32AcdF339BE976c98E22F6F318dB\n\nETH/USD: 0x5f4eC3Df9cbd43714FE2740f5E3616155c5b8419\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Introducing \"Curator\" by Llama\nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon and Fermin\ncreated: 2023-07-11\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces the `Curator` by Llama.\n\nThe `Curator` is a dedicated contract for managing the exchange of assets with MEV and price-impact protection, where possible.\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the Curator:\n\n* Swap Assets\n* Acquire LSTs\n* Transfer Assets\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe DAO is required to exchange assets. This could be to reduce the DAOs exposure to long tail assets or to increase stable coin holdings to facilitate payment to various service providers. It is not possible to perform swaps directly from the Collector / Treasury Contract. After much discussion, @llamaxyz and @bgdlabs have concluded that it is not viable to upgrade the Collector Contract to facilitate the efficient management of the DAO's assets. As a result, a series of separate contracts are required. \n\nA part of this solution is the `Curator`. The `Curator` receives assets from the Collector / Treasury Contract, swaps (or deposits) assets and sends the newly received asset to another address. The `Curator` is intended for solely exchanging assets and not holding assets. \n\nThe first iteration of the `Curator` is to be deployed on Ethereum and then later introduced to other networks. On Ethereum, the `Curator` is to interact with CoW Swap, Lido Protocol, and Rocket Pool contracts. \n\nTo limit the surface area of the contract, an `AllowList` will define which contracts the `Curator`can be interacted with. The `ShortExecutor` must first add each contract address to the `AllowList`. \n\nIt is possible to assign the `curatorRole()` to a specified wallet address, Treasury Manager. The `curatorRole` can then only interact with contract on the `AllowList` set by governance. The `AllowList` eliminates the risk of the `Curator` interacting with a malicious contract or running away with the DAO's funds. The intent is to implement the highest heirarchy of control.\n\nFor future deployments of the `Curator` on other networks, the aggregator protocol used to swap assets with MEV protection does so over a lengthy time horizon. This prevents any further steps performed by the same AIP submission. In these instances the `curatorRole` offers more flexibility and reduces the AIP overhead.\n\nEach Curator deployment will contain different functionality tailored to that network and Aave DAO's needs. As a result, each deployment will be presented to Aave DAO as an [ARFC] proposal for the community to discuss and vote on. \n\nDuring the intial deployment on Ethereum, @Llamaxyz advocates for using the `ShortExecutor` to perform all the necessary transactions. The `curatorRole` can be assigned at a later date. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe Ethereum Curator will provide the following functionality to Aave Protocol: \n\n1. Receive assets from the Treasury (assets must be pushed)\n2. Redeem aTokens for underlying spanning Aave v1, v2, and v3\n3. Swap assets via CoW Swap with MEV protection and using Milkman\n4. No reentrant \n5. Cancel trade\n6. Rescue tokens\n7. allowTokens(address[] tokens) onlyExecutorOrAllowedCaller\n8. Deposit ETH into Lido Finance Protocol to receive stETH\n9. Wrap stETH to create wstETH\n10. Deposit ETH into Rocket Pool's contract to receive rETH\n11. Transfer assets to Treasury\n12. Call a function to deposit assets in Aave v3 on behalf of Treasury\n13. Allow-list tokens/contracts that can be interacted with\n14. Allow-list Executor and approved multisig, CuratorRole().\n\nThe Curator will contain an `AllowList` defining which contracts the contract can interact with. The `AllowList` can only be updated by Aave Governance via the `ShortExecutor`. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance.\n\nThe [ARFC] publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].\n\n# Disclosure\n\n@llamaxyz is a service provider to Aave DAO. Llama is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is compensated by only Aave DAO for creating this ARFC. This is the sole work of the named authors. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Aave V3 Deployment on BNB Chain\n\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative\n\nDate: 2023-04-04\n\n## **Summary**:\n\nThis ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave V3 on the BNB Chain, expanding Aave's presence and tapping into the growing DeFi ecosystem and user base of BNB Chain.\n\n## **Abstract**:\n\nUpon approval by the Aave community, Aave V3 will be deployed on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.\n\n## **Motivation**:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**:\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with the following assets for collateral: CAKE, BNB, BTCB, WETH, USDC, and USDT. The table below provides the suggested risk parameters for each asset.\n\n|Risk Parameter|CAKE|BNB|BTCB|WETH|USDC|USDT|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|YES|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|NO|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|NO|NO|NO|NO|YES|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|55.00%|70.00%|70.00%|80.00%|77.50%|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|61.00%|75.00%|75.00%|82.50%|80.00%|80.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|5.00%|5.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|20.00%|20.00%|15.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,800,000|42,000|115|3,300.00|20,000,000*|20,000,000*|\n|Supply Cap|5,300,000|46,000|210|6,000.00|50,000,000*|50,000,000*|\n|Debt Ceiling|$10,000,000|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Stable Borrowing|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|uOptimal|45%|45%|45%|80%|90%|80%|\n|Base|0%|0%|0%|1%|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|7%|7%|3.80%|4%|4%|\n|Slope2|300%|300%|300%|80%|60%|75%|\n\n## **Deployment Checklist:**\n\n- Risk service providers feedback ✔\n- BGD Labs [Infrastructure/technical evaluation Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bnb-chain-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/13752)  ✔ \n- Oracle recommendation ✔ ([Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=bnb-chain))\n- The graph support ✔\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance  ✔ \n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~70$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Integrate BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 BNB.\n\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
