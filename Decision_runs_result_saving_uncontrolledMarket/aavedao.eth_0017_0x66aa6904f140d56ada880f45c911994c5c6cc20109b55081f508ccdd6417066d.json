We select a *slope1* parameter that would lead to the best attainable protocol welfare, operationalized as constrained gross revenue, based on a dynamic analysis of borrowers' aggregate responses to interest rate changes and total supply fluctuations. The primary components of the oracle architecture comprise:\n\n**Demand models** - a demand model is an object that encapsulates certain assumptions about the behavior of protocol borrowers and specifies an approach to estimating the numeric parameters that pin down this behavior \n\n**Demand model estimation** - given a demand model, parameters characterizing borrower behavior can be determined using aggregate market data, with the model's accuracy evaluated out of sample \n\n**Model selection** - the oracle pipeline estimates multiple demand models and evaluates their performance on out of sample historical data, so that the best model can be selected to drive the protocol optimization model  \n\n**Protocol optimization** - using the best demand model available to predict borrower response to interest rate changes, we determine the best slope parameter to maximize protocol welfare, subject to certain guardrails\n\nThe demand and protocol welfare models underlying the oracle transform aggregate market observables directly into a slope parameter recommendation, subject to programmable constraints implementing safety guardrails. As a concrete example, the constraints ensure that deviation from current parameter is appropriately restricted and that counterfactual demand induced by the optimal slope parameter does not breach utilization limits at any time.\n\n## Model flow\n\n![image.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidrpyy5wlryn6lzggou6if5ed6g26l7o3dpmahpxge5k2ei2axfwe)\n\n## Motivation\n\nRisk management requires setting parameters in a manner that safeguards the protocol against extreme events. Existing workflows that lead to particular recommendations for changes to protocol configuration, such as the shape of the interest rate curve, are driven by this consideration. We are proposing an oracle that would supplement this workflow, taking some of the critical elements of a risk configuration as a given and optimizing the protocol for an objective distinct from “minimizing bad debt accrual during periods of extreme volatility.” Here, we still treat risk management as the primary consideration, accepting some elements of the existing protocol configuration as an explicit constraint, while attempting to achieve constrained optimal protocol welfare.\n\nThe current approach for updating interest rates, utilizing the risk steward contract, allows for a maximum adjustment to the slope1 parameter of 100 bps every three days. However, this method requires considerable operational effort, as it involves manually creating a series of transactions to modify the interest rate curve across more than 60 stablecoin markets on 16 deployments, with a process akin to the one presented in [Supply and Borrow Cap Risk Oracle Activation](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-supply-and-borrow-cap-risk-oracle-activation/20834). This process becomes especially inefficient during repricing events, where the manual overhead and fundamental constraints hamper the ability to respond dynamically to changes in demand.\n\nAs Aave is the largest DeFi lending protocol, especially in terms of aggregate stablecoin liquidity, it effectively boasts the title of the primary market when deducing the market-priced interest rate on-chain. It is therefore essential to adopt a generalized, transparent, and robust methodology grounded in aggregate demand models—mathematically simple yet capable of generating meaningful predictions about future borrower behavior to optimize its configuration accordingly. By using multiple models and selecting the best ones dynamically, we ensure that the methodology is flexible enough to capture the evolving characteristics of demand for stablecoins, taking advantage of variation in supply to estimate demand model parameters. This approach does not rely on interest rate variation or any assumptions on the origin of existing interest rate curve parameters, making it robust to feedback loops.\n\n# Data\n\nWe model the demand, or total borrowing, as aggregate demand curves, or mathematical functions relating the prevailing market interest rate to demand. The particular shape of any such curve encodes the behavior of protocol borrowers in response to changes we make to the interest rate curve parameters. Each type of demand curve is defined by some parameters, which we can estimate using aggregate market data. The aggregate market data feeding into the model estimation component tracks total borrowing, supply and other market characteristics, such as the current interest rate curve settings, for supported chains, tokens and markets at a ~10-15 minute cadence. All estimation and protocol optimization utilize the observations at each update, although our analysis will use some quantities aggregated to daily or hourly levels, for the reader's convenience.\n\n# Demand\n\n## Demand models\n\nConceptually, a demand model should be thought of as a triple consisting of a **demand function**, **estimation objective** and **loss function**. The demand function captures the aggregate change to total borrowing in response to a change in the interest rate curve. The estimation objective and loss function determine how the demand curve is fit to historical data.  \n\nThe demand functions represent downward sloping aggregate demand, with some scale parameter *A*, characterizing the overall level of demand, and a parameter *σ* characterizing the elasticity, or the relative magnitude of the demand response to a change in interest rates.\n\nOur demand functions are\n\n**isoelastic** - *Ax^σ*, the elasticity parameter fixes the price elasticity at all points along the curve\n\n**exponential** - *Ae^(-σx)*\n\n**linear** - *A + σx*, the elasticity parameter is the slope of the line\n\nEstimation objectives represent the deviation that the estimation program attempts to minimize according to some loss function\n\n**price** - deviation from observed price, given the estimated demand and implied price\n\n**demand** - deviation from observed demand\n\nFinally, the loss functions are\n\n**L1** - minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, relatively insensitive to outliers\n\n**L2** - minimizes the sum of squared residuals\n\nConsequently, we estimate a total of up to 12 different demand models for each run of the estimation and protocol welfare optimization pipeline, selecting the best one to serve as the representation of demand response for the protocol welfare optimization program.\n\n## Estimation\n\n### Model estimation strategy\n\nIn order to use a demand model for predicting counterfactual borrower response to adjustment in the interest rate curve parameters, we must recover the values of the scale and elasticity parameters from historical data. The demand model parameters for a particular function are estimated using non-linear regressions, minimizing the selected loss relative to the target determined by the objective. The particular choice of loss function determines the influence of outliers in the estimation. Minimizing loss can be thought of as finding a function in a particular class (e.g., isoelastic demand curves) that is “closest” to the observed data, with “closeness” measured by the chosen loss function. This “closest” function is identified, within its class, by the values of its parameters.\n\nWe do not compute standard errors or other explicitly statistical constructs, as we are concerned primarily with prediction rather than statistical inference. To elaborate on this further, the purpose of a typical *econometric* exercise of this nature, as might be performed by a practitioner of demand modeling in academia or economic consulting, is to determine the values of the demand function parameters in the service of making a point concerning a theoretical claim (e.g., that the demand should be either elastic, or inelastic). The predictions of a theoretical model of demand are assessed based on a fixed dataset, and subjected to a number of tests (e.g., for normality of the noise, model selection, etc.) to winnow the models down to a particular function, which is then usually estimated using a linear regression. \n\nOur approach, while taking inspiration from standard economic models of demand, tackles the problem within a simple machine learning framework. We care most about the quality of our short-term predictions of demand response, rather than falsifying the predictions of some theoretical model. Consequently, we simply estimate the characteristics of demand on some window of data, and then predict its behavior on a disjoint time window of data to assess the quality of a particular model, that is, its out of sample fit. \n\nIn both the statistical and the machine learning approaches to modeling data-generating processes, overfitting is often a major concern. In the case of statistical models, overfitting results in poor estimation of model parameters and standard errors, while in the machine learning framework, it leads to poor out-of-sample fit. However, we restrict our models to fairly rigid functional forms, making overfitting essentially impossible.\n\nThe [Appendix](https://www.notion.so/Appendix-1d057ab37ebf80ae8c50ed4816248f49?pvs=21) presents a detailed example of model definition and estimation for an isoelastic demand function with a price objective and an L2 loss function, with an explanation of how predictions are done on each prediction window.\n\n### Retrospective predictive fit\n\nThe estimating regressions are performed on a series of partially overlapping windows of data for each model, with predictions, used in model performance evaluation, made for some time frame following the estimation window. The predicted demand is then reconstructed for the entire period of interest to assess predictive fit. In the online estimation-prediction-optimization oracle workflow, we use the most recent window alone, but for subsequent analysis we will be using multiple windows.\n\n![image (1).jpg](ipfs://bafkreibzemagcw3m233i7nsdm7ur5lekak2phvsxbquu24w2o3uyqrhteq)\n\n### Evaluation\n\nThe performance of different demand models within the prediction windows is assessed using a predictive fit measure, such as R^2, MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Deviation) or a normalized sum of residuals. The latter measure most closely tracks “visual” fit, particularly in time-aggregated series, but is insensitive to variance. The best performing model is selected to serve as the basis for the protocol welfare optimization program.\n\n## Demand model selection\n\nAny individual model cannot be relied upon to serve as the basis for protocol welfare optimization in all timeframes. This is because, ultimately, aggregate demand is an abstraction over individual behavior of many different participants in the protocol, each with unique risk preferences, token holdings and outside options for deployment of liquidity. Over time, all of these participant characteristics evolve. Additionally, some participants may enter and exit the protocol over time. This implies that having a fixed demand function representing aggregate demand across time is unlikely to correctly reflect the aggregate behavior of the participants. We operationalize the notion of “correctness” by retrospective predictive fit, that is, the degree to which out of sample prediction matches the actually observed behavior in the past.\n\nSelecting a model on each of our moving prediction windows dynamically, we can significantly improve upon the performance of any given model. In fact, given the simplicity of our estimation approach, the predictive fit of the best-in-each-prediction-window model is surprisingly good. In the chart below, tracing demand and predicted demand from September 2024 to February 2025 for Aave’s Ethereum-core market, every window’s predicted demand is derived from the best-performing (according to the normalized sum of residuals measure) model for that window. Each window has an estimation timeframe of 7 days and a prediction timeframe of 3 days. \n\n![image (2).jpg](ipfs://bafybeie2kl6g6kyodyqne7hqst2xayhcjv5vexr3jtahdizn6tozmcyoma)\n\n# Protocol welfare model\n\n## Utilization-constrained protocol revenue as protocol welfare\n\nThere are several principles that guide our selection of aggregate protocol revenue as a measure of protocol welfare\n\n- Every user with a healthy position is necessarily a supplier in an over-collateralized protocol\n- Given the inherently risky nature of crypto markets, we can assume that the participants are, at least, risk-neutral\n- User preference is always to make more money from the participation protocol for any fixed quantity of tokens supplied\n\nNevertheless, because crypto markets are punctuated by short periods of extreme volatility and severe price corrections, we have to explicitly guard against supply depletion to preclude even transient insolvencies from damaging public perceptions of the protocol's security.\n\nFollowing the principles and the considerations above, we define platform welfare as *utilization-constrained aggregate supplier revenue*. In formal terms, we will treat aggregate protocol revenue as the objective of an optimization program, while measures of maximal allowable utilization derived from analyses focused on extreme events are taken as a constraint on the counterfactual demand at the constrained optimal *slope1*.\n\n## Protocol optimization program\n\nEffectively optimizing protocol welfare requires that the demand response to changes in the interest rate curve closely reflect the characteristics of underlying demand. Otherwise, the optimal interest rate curve parameter settings are optimal in name only, since the response of the borrowers to parameter changes cannot be effectively predicted.\n\nWe will assume that supply is a fixed quantity at every observation time. In principle, the supply side (which is, as we point out above, *also the demand side*) should be responsive to the prices we set. While it is possible, in principle, to formulate a more complex problem that considers both demand and supply response, we only consider the former, for tractability. Below, we present a minimal example of a protocol optimization program.\n\nLet us introduce some symbolic quantities\n\n![image 3.png](ipfs://bafybeibc6gef3dbffadk5iodbnymhu7zu4ghgpr2xh7jumask5j26mfv44)\n\nWe can now formulate a candidate optimization program for protocol welfare, normalizing both supply and demand by the total supply for illustration, so that we do not need to consider utilization separately from demand\n\n![image 4.png](ipfs://bafkreifa2egvpi6ofkp7tyzmt4lzy6jv5543odex3sxfyfqxwgqhafuxbe)\n\nThe program aims to maximize revenue from interest accrual, subject to a realized utilization constraint, which requires that the demand response not result in utilization above some threshold for every single datapoint. This is an example of an essential guardrail, which ensures that the optimal solution respects a safeguard that we do not directly encode into the protocol objective.\n\n## Protocol optimization analysis\n\nWe perform the optimization of the *slope1* parameter with responsive demand, using our prior demand model parameter estimates for this purpose, recomputing the counterfactual demand at each step in the optimization. To help us understand the operation and output of the protocol optimization model, we will examine the evolution of interest rate curves and the impact of relaxing the realized utilization constraint.\n\nWe illustrate the retrospective operation of our protocol optimization model using 2 months of data for USDC and USDT stablecoins within the Ethereum-core market for Aave V3. The timeframe ranges from 2024-12-24 to 2025-02-23. We let the slope parameter range over [0.01, 0.3], however, we impose a realized utilization constraint that guarantees that at no observation time does the counterfactual utilization demand at the optimum exceed a given threshold. As before, the estimation window size is 7 days and the prediction window size is 3 days. We restrict the model set to the 4 isoelastic demand function models for illustration, as other models can lead to greater variability in optimal slope values on this dataset.\n\n### Counterfactual Interest Rate Curve Parameters Evolution\n\nThe final output of a successful simulation model run is a new *slope1* parameter, effectively defining a new interest rate curve as a function of utilization, which then evolves over time as the estimation and prediction windows move forward, as seen below for a realized utilization constraint of 91.5%, just slightly below the kink.\n\nOver the timeframe under consideration, the total supply of both USDC and USDT is rising, but the demand is declining, leading to declining protocol revenues and low utilization.\n\n![image 5.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifgjxvcrfraljr7cu2xokof2fzczynbctnvw4mekemymkfulfietu)\n\nThe historical response to this was a gradual lowering of interest rates by decreasing the *slope1* parameter, however, utilization continued to decline. Our protocol optimization model would have led to more aggressive downward adjustment. \n\n![image 6.jpg](ipfs://bafkreien4lxxer67eapinl2fzyeatypycdsmsgryd6awjrjtprnrnoq2oe)\n\nGiven our demand model estimates, this would have kept utilization close to the specified realized utilization constraint and much higher than what was achieved by the historical policy.\n\n![image 7.jpg](ipfs://bafybeiaeltubmjypl6r5hejoddh2gzjfyw7idvy3oc2rfg2v4ziud3vfbi)\n\nHigher utilization would have offset the lower interest rates, leading to greater revenue for the protocol.\n\n![image 8.jpg](ipfs://bafybeigovmbchdnucrhljra66lbsi4vhexpycifbi7k5aqun3vhecnbx2u)\n\n# Model operation and community feedback\n\nOur approach relies on a necessarily reductive economic model of aggregate demand, which cannot incorporate all of the dynamic factors that influence real DeFi markets. The design, and specifically its underlying tooling, is a plug-and-play framework for benchmarking different protocol objectives, demand models and constraints, such as interest rate curve restrictions imposed by utilization incentive programs. This lets us leverage existing community expertise to iterate towards a better simulation model and maximal protocol welfare.\n\n## Triggers & limits\n\nThe proposed interest rate oracle leverages Edge Infrastructure to automate interest rate adjustments within set guardrails. Our methodology relies on accurate demand models to produce meaningful parameter recommendations. This means that indicators of demand behavior deviating from the last model used for protocol optimization should trigger a simulation run to refresh the demand models and produce a new parameter recommendation. A measure of deviation in observed demand can be given as\n\n![11.png](ipfs://bafkreic7ijnqkg522szkquy5sgdwugbivxhxfb6iwraq7ukrrwmbmttpsi)\n\nAdditional triggers include breaches of specific guardrails, as well as time-triggers for regular updates.\n\n- Excessive total borrowing deviation trigger\n    - Deviation from total borrowing implies that the underlying demand model requires a refresh\n    - Allows short-term average deviation to be greater than long-term average deviations, as the latter is a stronger indicator of the demand model going stale\n        - Short-term, 10 minutes to 1 hour (highest allowed aggregate deviation)\n        - Medium-term, 1 hour to 24 hours\n        - Long-term, 24 hours to 1 month (lowest allowed aggregate deviation)\n- Utilization exceeding thresholds trigger\n    - Excessive utilization breaches a constraint we explicitly impose on the model\n    - Excessive utilization measures are operationalized as an aggregate function of time and distances from the threshold, evaluated over a defined interval\n- Manual triggers\n    - Scheduled background back-testing and stress-testing simulations raise alerts to notify the risk management team of potentially advantageous updates even in the absence of significant deviations\n    - Observed utilization approaching the realized utilization threshold, an explicit model constraint, raises an alert to notify the risk management team of the need to review demand and interest rate behavior\n\nThe updates, similarly to those for the supply and borrow cap oracle, are limited in frequency and magnitude. Initially, frequency of regular updates and magnitude limits shall be set to 72 hours and 50 basis points respectively.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Isoelastic demand with a price objective and an L2 loss function\n\n### Variables\n\n![image 9.png](ipfs://bafkreib6gev6nqoxvkbk2rk234enaxcabw3bviicqs4zwxj2reg7yfu7oa)\n\n### Functional form\n\nAssume that demand in each period has a [constant price elasticity](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2ybrzctusv), or isoelastic, form\n\n![image|695x76](upload://wapFGM17GcAApqVXvkzIyc6AoTL.png)\n\nThe elasticity parameter *σ* determines the % change in demand given a % change in price, at all prices along the curve. The scaling parameter *A* is the level of fully inelastic demand. The observable quantities, supply and demand, are interpreted to be USD. Price is assumed to be periodic interest rate as a decimal. Note that the choice of price scaling (e.g., periodic rate, APR, or $ cost to borrow a $1) is consequential to elasticity estimates, unless it is multiplicative. \n\nGiven the assumption of constant price elasticity for the demand, it follows that, in each period, demand, supply and price must satisfy the following equation\n\n![image|709x77](upload://sGFPTpz3HzxybilevIQs298Ejhl.png)\n\nThe price mapping is assumed to be continuous and monotonically increasing in utilization *ut = Dt / St*, though in the particular markets belonging to the Aave platform that we will be dealing with, they take a specific piece-wise linear form\n\n![image|701x121](upload://zJpUzpP1cXOvpn5aG3zdxeO7cEN.png)\n\n### Estimation of demand parameters\n\nWe take a simple machine learning style approach to determining the demand function parameters, numerically solving the following optimization program\n\n![image|708x93](upload://2VVpxkwn11Lu94cBDxZKLL9YqZH.png)\n\nThe solution minimizes the Euclidean distance between demand implied by the constant elasticity form and observed demand vectors, or the “sum of squared residuals,” as it is usually known in econometrics.\n\nAlternatively, the optimization program could be reformulated to minimize distance to the observed price vector\n\n![image|703x111](upload://xMMNqProG21qHv8pKcYyb5VglDb.png)\n\nThese optimization programs should be equivalent under our assumptions. That is, if we were to observe some data generating process arising from random variation of a flat supply curve, generating the observables *(D, P)t*, the solutions to the programs would be the same. However, in practice we do not observe such a process. We also encounter issues with numerical optimization algorithms, making the choice of a particular formulation consequential and encouraging the use of multiple models in practice.\n\n### Prediction of future demand\n\nBecause of the mechanical linkage between utilization and interest rate, observed demand and prices are positively correlated. However, we are estimating the parameters of a demand curve that is expected to be downward sloping (i.e., “holding everything else equal,” demand should decrease as prices increase).\n\nTaking into account the linkage through the interest rate curve, in each time period we can predict future demand by numerically solving the following equation \n\n![image|703x66](upload://n07pmZr3vftzQtrSBzVq3ewxodt.png)",

Currently, selling 500 weETH incurs less than 2% price slippage.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082239.816.png](ipfs://bafkreibyphb5tf77ava6uh66nvyjywpge3xm5eqiymiltgo7k5qlaw45sy)\nweETH's liquidity on Base has remained similarly stable following an increase in the 4th quarter of 2024. Currently, selling 650 weETH incurs less than 2% price slippage.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082243.366.png](ipfs://bafkreid4jarfroyybcfct7r5s4eqk5cl5lpzraat4iuzfihxzprverx3hq)\nweETH’s DEX liquidity on Ethereum has remained stable over the last 6 months, with the current sell liquidity under a 1% price impact being of 15,000 weETH.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082246.864.png](ipfs://bafkreicpeji6azwsuwu6pplrqt3z4obkl7jwvh55cij52wr3tglhtiinmq)\n### Peg Stability\n\nBelow, we analyze weETH’s peg stability during the August 5, 2024, market stress event, in which WETH fell 21%. Evaluating weETH’s exchange rate stability is critical for assessing LTV and E-mode parameters, as price deviations between weETH and WETH can lead to delays in liquidation and arbitrage-driven borrowing, impacting risk exposure.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-10 at 3.30.44 PM (1).png](ipfs://bafybeiat3fnejbuqh4qq74vs6fseh3f55jpf5viqmze3u33pznx3zqm54e)\nOn August 5, the weETH/WETH market rate followed a similar trajectory, with a maximum deviation reaching 140 bps. While the recovery speed on both chains was comparable, Ethereum exhibited a slightly faster reversion to the internal exchange rate. On Arbitrum, the market rate took longer to revert compared to Base and Ethereum. However, all three instances demonstrated a successful recovery and quick mean reversion.\n\n### LT & LTV\n\nBased on the above observations, weETH’s liquidity on Base has remained stable after recent improvements, and its ability to maintain a stable peg under stressful market conditions supports an LTV&LT increase. Therefore, we recommend increasing LTV to 75% and LT to 77%. Additionally, we propose establishing a separate weETH/WETH Liquid E-Mode with higher parameters to enhance users' capital efficiency rather than adjusting the parameters within the existing E-Mode.\n\nOn Arbitrum, weETH demonstrates similar stability in liquidity compared to Base but exhibits slightly weaker peg stability than on Base and Ethereum. However, its properties are still sufficient to recommend increasing its collateral parameters to 75% and 77%, aligning them with those on Base.\n\nHowever, given the reduced liquidity present on the Base chain we recommend adjusting the Liquidation Bonus within the weETH/WETH E-Mode to 1.25% to mitigate the price impact caused by large highly correlated positions.\n\n# wstETH\n\nFollowing the introduction to Liquid E-Modes with Aave v3.2, which enables targeted combinations of collateral and debt assets, we propose aligning the wstETH’s more aggressive parameters currently present on the Prime instance across all Aave deployments. Thanks to wstETH’s battle-tested stability, this change will improve capital efficiency while maintaining reduced risk.\n\nTo align the LT and LTV of wstETH to those used within Prime’s E-Mode, we cover the asset's volatility and peg over multiple instances.\n\nOn Base, wstETH’s liquidity against WETH has declined in recent months. However, thanks to the fast bridging speed and quick mean reversion properties, it is still sufficient to support the proposed parameters. \n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082253.225.png](ipfs://bafkreicfztiw2mj7wcz3t53wlcupdgpw5ivssomv7bnzhzrnvytpf2b76y)\nIts liquidity has also fallen slightly on Arbitrum, though it has been more stable in the past two months, with a 1,000 wstETH for WETH swap able to be completed for less than 1% price slippage.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082256.676.png](ipfs://bafkreifn2s3fylqr4tq4rhfrhtv2g6omqzusnnp7eussf5otvs5hh7lv2e)\n### Peg Stability\n\nPrice deviations can cause problems like arbitrage exploitation, where, given the underlying liquidation threshold, users take advantage of price differences between the protocol’s fundamental valuation of an asset and its market price, potentially destabilizing liquidity. This can lead to WETH debt accrual and thus, in tandem with WETH collateral liquidations and withdrawals due to the underwriting of temporary mispriced debt, lead to interest rate and utilization spikes, with LST/LRT-collateralized e-mode LTVs gradually (net) increasing while WETH collateralized stablecoin debt positions risk unperformed liquidations due to such utilization rates.\n\nThese deviations typically arise during periods of market stress. In such scenarios, deviations are driven by complex factors, including investor de-risking from volatile assets, liquidation cascades triggered by non-correlated positions such as stablecoin borrows against WETH, and, in rare cases, slashing events that erode confidence in an asset. The speed of reversion is generally contingent on the market priced implied duration risk associated with such a WETH-correlated asset, which can be dynamic dictated by exit queue considerations, as well as the game-theoretic value given by the fundamental robustness and on-chain liquidity of the asset itself.\n\nFor this reason, to gauge the resilience of wstETH’s peg to ETH across different chains, given by the available liquidity and leverage on the chain, we analyze price behavior during the market drop that occurred on August 5, 2024, during which WETH suffered a 21% daily drop, with the rest of the market following suit and LST/LRT assets showing significant deviations. Despite that, wstETH demonstrated strong reversion characteristics across Base, Arbitrum, and Scroll. This observation indicates a high degree of stability that supports the proposed E-Mode parameters.\n\n- **Ethereum:** On Ethereum, wstETH dropped to a minimum of 1.1531 WETH, representing a 1.85% depeg. The asset quickly returned within 0.5% from its exchange rate, showing a strong mean reversion tendency.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082259.823.png](ipfs://bafkreihnkljagpcy5pe5vwqq5kwcins3hicybvibzn7is5mjhlh3erxdp4)\n- **Base**: On Base, wstETH dropped to a minimum of 1.1490 WETH, representing a 2.1% depeg. Despite this dip, the asset quickly returned to its peg, demonstrating resilience and a tendency toward mean reversion under stress.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082302.791.png](ipfs://bafkreihzzceteodebsmdmaaw7damfktztpwgavkjvfaockw44nsdcijcl4)\n- **Arbitrum**: On Arbitrum, wstETH experienced a smaller depeg of 1.66%, reaching a low of 1.1550 WETH. Although this recovery was slightly slower than on Base, wstETH still demonstrated consistent mean reversion and stability.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082305.579.png](ipfs://bafkreid76hrccbxg3bksxhpfoygt5agutoy7wwmahcl6jjwtlcdfzfft6y)\n### LT and LTV\n\nThe combination of robust liquidity, strong peg stability, and the inherent resilience of wstETH ensures that aligning LTV and LT parameters for the wstETH/WETH E-Mode on Arbitrum, Base and Core to the one on Lido instance is both feasible and prudent. This is because the ETH-correlated E-Mode configuration is constrained by the least liquid and least stable assets within the pool, limiting capital efficiency across the board. However, with these updated configurations, we can adopt parameters that better reflect the liquidity and stability of wstETH, allowing for higher capital efficiency in isolated E-Modes.\n\nHence, we recommend setting the LTV at 93.5% and the LT at 95.5%. By enabling a high level of leverage, these parameters are also expected to increase demand for WETH across the chains.\n\n### Collateral and Borrowable\n\nTo prevent same-asset looping, which could undermine future use of liquidity incentives and lead to unintended utilization, we recommend configuring wstETH as collateral and WETH as borrowable in the proposed E-Mode. This structure aligns with the approach detailed in [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-wsteth-weth-e-mode-parameters-for-lido-market-10-20-24/19542), which advocates for selective collateral and borrowing configurations to maintain market efficiency.\n\n## Specification\n\nBased on the observations and considerations outlined above, we recommend implementing the following liquid E-Mode configuration for the weETH/WETH pair on Base and proposing an LTV adjustment for weETH on both Arbitrum, Base, and Core Instances.\n\n### **weETH/WETH E-Mode (Base)**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | weETH | WETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 93% | - |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95% | - |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.25% | - |\n\n### **weETH LT&LTV**\n\n| **Asset** | **Chain** | **Current LTV** | **Recommended LTV** | **Current LT** | **Recommended LT** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| weETH | Base | 72.5% | 75% | 75% | 77% |\n| weETH | Arbitrum | 72.5% | 75% | 75% | 77% |\n\n### wstETH/ WETH **E-Mode** (Base)\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | wstETH | WETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 93.5% | 93.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95.5% | 95.5% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n### wstETH/ WETH **E-Mode** (Arbitrum)\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | wstETH | WETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 93.5% | 93.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95.5% | 95.5% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n### wstETH/ WETH **E-Mode** (Ethereum Core)\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | wstETH | WETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 93.5% | 93.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95.5% | 95.5% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "# Summary\nChaos Labs proposes a **12-month early renewal** of our risk management partnership with the Aave DAO, starting July 13, 2025. This renewal will be a **new and separate engagement stream**, operating **in parallel with the current engagement**, which remains active through November 12, 2025. The early renewal will **not affect the existing engagement** and will continue independently through July 12, 2026.\n\nThis proposal reflects both the expanded scope of work already delivered—including support for new asset classes, implementation of systemic risk mechanisms, and over 1,100 risk parameter updates—and Chaos Labs’ continued commitment to building critical components of Aave’s risk infrastructure.\n\nOur top priority for the upcoming term is the deployment and scaling of the Edge Risk Oracle, which currently secures over $5B in deposits and dynamically manages supply caps, borrow caps, interest rate curves, and PT parameters. Significant functional expansions are underway to further automate and strengthen the protocol’s risk systems.\n\nWe are seeking DAO alignment on this strategic direction and resource allocation to ensure the sustained delivery, scalability, and decentralization of Aave’s risk management infrastructure.\n\n## Background & Context\n\nChaos Labs was appointed by the Aave DAO in November 2022 as its dedicated risk partner and is currently operating under a 12-month engagement that began in November 2024. Since the start of this current term, Aave has experienced substantial growth—doubling its TVL from $12B to $24B and generating over $71.5M in protocol revenue. This rapid expansion has been accompanied by a surge in protocol complexity across assets, deployments, and mechanisms.\n\nOver this same period, Aave has integrated or prepared for several major system upgrades: onboarding of Principal Tokens (PTs); deployment of mechanisms such as Smart Value Recapture (SVR); and the upcoming launch of Umbrella, Aave’s insolvency protection layer.\n\nTo meet these evolving needs, Chaos Labs has transitioned from periodic risk reviews to delivering deeply integrated, protocol-native risk automation infrastructure. At the core of this system is our Edge Risk Oracle architecture, which powers automated, governance-bounded updates to supply and borrow caps, interest rate curves, and Principal Token collateral parameters—actively securing over $5B in deposits across Aave markets. In parallel, we’ve expanded our real-time monitoring infrastructure, executed over 1,100 parameter updates via the Risk Stewards, and published targeted research on high-impact risk domains such as Ethereum validator staking penalties, Ethena-related risks, and SVR recapture dynamics.\n\nAs Aave prepares to onboard 10+ additional deployments and expand its asset coverage further, the protocol’s resilience and capital efficiency will depend on the continued development of a modular, data-driven risk layer. This renewal enables Chaos Labs to maintain and scale that infrastructure in lockstep with Aave’s accelerating trajectory.\n\n## Enhanced Scope and Value Delivery Highlights\n\nDespite renewing at flat commercials of **$2M** in November, Chaos Labs has significantly expanded its work's scope, volume, and impact compared to the prior year, delivering substantially more value **without a budget increase**.\n\nOver the past six months of the current engagement, Chaos Labs has provided both tactical execution and strategic risk support, surpassing last year’s outputs across all key metrics:\n\n- **64 asset listing analyses** completed in the past 7 months (vs. 46 in the entire previous year), reflecting a sharp increase in volume and diligence scope.\n- **13 new deployment listings**, with 10 scheduled to go live shortly, significantly expanding protocol reach and impact.\n- **226 supply cap, 203 borrow cap, and 572 interest rate curve updates** executed through the Risk Stewards, scaling operational coverage.\n- **260 total forum posts** spanning proposal authorship, parameter reviews, research, and real-time risk insights, reinforcing Chaos Labs’ governance leadership.\n\n![image - 2025-06-12T210246.737.png](ipfs://bafkreiefqlamz46t2mv2g67iq3yw22knonzuttnvdyn5ivz5el6sn4cqnu)\n\nThe quality and depth of asset listings have significantly evolved, centered on the fundamental characteristics of each asset and its interaction with Aave’s core mechanisms. Listings incorporate understanding how the asset functions within its native protocol, aligning risk parameters with issuer-specific designs such as redemption logic, staking mechanics, or rebase behavior at a technical level.

Building on our existing deployments, the following areas are targeted for upcoming integration:\n\n- **Expansion of Supply & Borrow Cap Oracles** to all Aave V3 instances, ensuring consistent and utilization-optimized cap management across deployments.\n- **Deployment of Interest Rate Curve Oracles** across stablecoin and high-volume collateral markets, enabling real-time dynamic pricing to optimize protocol welfare and maintain competitive market conditions.\n- **Ongoing Principal Token (PT) Risk Oracle coverage**, ensuring that all new PT listings are automatically supported with live collateral parameter adjustments, while maintaining existing integrations.\n- **Automated Kill Switch Integration** for LSTs, LRTs, Ethena-related, and other yield-bearing derivatives, disabling supply or borrow functionality under adverse events such as validator slashing, depegs, or liquidity collapse.\n- **Reserve Factor Risk Oracle**, to dynamically optimize DAO revenue through automated reserve factor tuning, aligned with Umbrella’s framework and responsive to shifting market dynamics and liquidity flows.\n\nAll updates will continue to be bound by governance-approved parameters and transparently tracked through public dashboards. This upcoming roadmap represents a significant step toward full-spectrum oracle-driven risk automation across the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### SVR & Real-Time Monitoring Infrastructure\n\nChaos Labs will continue to operate and enhance Aave’s real-time risk and monitoring infrastructure, which serves as the backbone of protocol-level visibility and operational responsiveness.\n\nWe will expand monitoring dashboards to support all future deployments, incorporating detailed liquidation performance analytics across collateral types and borrower segments. This includes real-time tracking of oracle deviations, recapture efficiency, and execution quality, enabling the DAO to evaluate the effectiveness of MEV recapture and broader liquidation outcomes.\n\nBeyond SVR, our infrastructure will maintain wallet-level exposure analysis, surfacing risks related to position concentration, correlated collateral dependencies, and liquidation clustering potential. These insights will be paired with risk alerting systems, flagging real-time anomalies such as overutilized assets, depleted liquidity, or extreme funding dislocations.\n\nWe will also continue to publish live Oracle performance logs and full update histories for all automated parameter changes, including caps, LTVs, interest rates, and more. This ensures ongoing transparency, accountability, and governance alignment across all Chaos-managed automation layers within the Aave protocol.\n\n### Aave Umbrella: Deployment, Maintenance, Monitoring & Parameterization\n\nChaos Labs is leading the risk management and parameter calibration efforts for Aave Umbrella, a native insolvency protection mechanism that introduces a tranche structure to absorb bad debt under stress scenarios. Umbrella will enhance Aave’s systemic resilience by enabling structured risk-sharing and coordinated protection across markets and deployments.\n\nDuring this engagement, we will focus on operationalizing Umbrella across active and upcoming deployments. This includes simulation-backed design of exposure caps, freeze conditions, and incentive structures tailored to the unique risk profile of each reserve.\n\nWe will provide ongoing support and insights to the Aave Finance Committee in calibrating key parameters such as:\n\n- **`maxEmissionPerYear`**, which reflects the incremental yield required to compensate users for staking into Umbrella. Its calibration will account for factors including foregone collateral utility, prevailing interest rate environments, cooldown risk, and systemic exposure.\n- **`Target Liquidity`**, representing the optimal reserve coverage needed to mitigate tail risks, derived using a quantitative Value-at-Risk (VaR) framework. This ensures efficient sizing of Umbrella participation across volatile and composable markets.\n\nTo support transparency and community alignment, we are also launching a dedicated Umbrella Dashboard, providing real-time analytics and visualizations on reserve coverage, parameterization status, and system-wide protection metrics.\n\nUmbrella will serve as a key component of Aave’s systemic risk architecture, offering structured insolvency protection and capital efficiency across an increasingly complex multi-deployment environment.\n\n### Asset Listings & Adaptive Risk Management\n\nAs Aave continues to expand across new networks, asset types, and market structures, the protocol requires a more agile, simulation-driven risk framework capable of responding to a constantly evolving landscape. Chaos Labs will continue to lead risk onboarding and configuration for new assets and deployments, adapting to novel pricing mechanisms and composable integrations as they emerge.\n\nRather than relying solely on fixed parameter templates, our approach is dynamic and context-specific. We evaluate each asset and market instance on its own terms, factoring in liquidity, volatility, composability, and systemic impact. As Aave’s complexity increases, we ensure that risk management scales accordingly, applying both proactive simulations and real-time monitoring to inform governance-aligned recommendations.\n\nAll adjustments are implemented through the Risk Steward framework, enabling timely and bounded execution. Each action is paired with transparent rationale and tradeoff analysis, ensuring the community remains informed and aligned as the protocol grows in depth and reach.\n\n### GHO Risk Management\n\nChaos Labs will continue managing GHO risk through parameter tuning, peg monitoring, and facilitator oversight. With the launch of sGHO and the Aave Savings Rate (ASR), we are developing a comprehensive quantitative model to optimize ASR parameters—AMP, Premium, and Index Rate—ensuring yields remain competitive, sustainable, and resistant to arbitrage.\n\nWe will benchmark sGHO against comparable stablecoins, monitor user behavior, and propose adjustments as needed. All insights will be surfaced via our GHO Risk Dashboard, covering peg health, ASR dynamics, and facilitator activity in real time.\n\nIn parallel, we will maintain and expand monitoring of the GHO peg across centralized and decentralized exchanges, analyzing liquidity, volume, and spread behavior under various market conditions. We will continue onboarding support for new GHO facilitators, offering simulations and stress-testing of credit allocation models, collateral design, and associated systemic risk.\n\n### Incident Response & DAO Support\n\nAs Aave’s risk partner, Chaos Labs will remain on call to respond to major market events or protocol-level disruptions. These events may include oracle failures or feed manipulation, validator slashing incidents that impact collateral values, asset-specific volatility (e.g., USDe or stETH depegs), and coordinated liquidation events during systemic stress. With the ongoing integration of the Edge Risk Oracle infrastructure, many of these scenarios can now be proactively addressed through automated parameter adjustments and killswitch logic, reducing manual intervention and minimizing the risk of cascading failures.\n\nOur incident response protocol includes rapid modeling of potential impact, simulation of mitigation paths, coordination with DAO stakeholders and Guardians, and publication of real-time risk updates with proposed governance actions. We will also produce post-incident reports that evaluate event triggers, parameter effectiveness, and potential upgrades to future protections.\n\nOur role as an embedded operational risk steward ensures that Aave can respond with speed, confidence, and clarity when it matters most.\n\n## Community Engagement & Governance\n\nChaos Labs will:\n\n- Publish monthly updates summarizing progress, simulations, Oracle activity, and dashboard enhancements, which can be observed in [this](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-monthly-community-update/11174/27?u=chaoslabs) thread.\n- Remain active on the Aave Governance Forum with posts, feedback, and proposal authorship\n- Maintain weekly syncs with delegates and contributors\n- Share dashboards, documentation, and analysis artifacts for community insight\n\n## Early Renewal Commercial Terms\n\nTo ensure continuity and align long-term commitments, we propose executing an early renewal agreement, effective **July 13, 2025, with a 12-month term** running through July 12, 2026.\n\n**This renewal will run concurrently with the existing contract until November 12, 2025, after which it will continue as the sole active agreement through its conclusion on July 12, 2026.**\n\nThis proposal reflects both the **expanded scope of work already delivered**—including support for new asset classes, implementation of systemic risk mechanisms, and over **1,100 risk parameter updates**—and Chaos Labs’ continued commitment to building critical components of Aave’s risk infrastructure.\n\n**Early Renewal Summary:**\n\n- **Renewal Term:** July 13, 2025 – July 12, 2026\n- **Duration:** 12 Months\n- **Annual Contract Value:** $3,000,000 USD\n    - 85% - $2,550,000 USD in aEthLidoGHO\n    - 15% - $450,000 USD in AAVE\n        - AAVE price (and corresponding amount of tokens allocated to Chaos) will be determined using a 30-day time-weighted average price (TWAP) based on CoinGecko pricing at the time of Snapshot conclusion.\n- **Payment Method:** Streamed linearly via `createStream()` using `IAaveEcosystemReserveController`\n- **Recipient Address:** `0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0` (Chaos Labs multisig)\n\n## Conflict Disclosures\n\nChaos Labs provides risk services to other DeFi protocols (e.g., Benqi, Gearbox, Venus).

        "body": "# Summary\n\nBuilding on the recent integration of [Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-generalized-risk-stewards-agrs-activation/19178), this proposal introduces an automated Risk Oracle framework to enhance the efficiency of Supply and Borrow cap updates within the Aave Protocol. The framework is built around two core components: (1) algorithmic, simulation-based assessments continuously conducted to evaluate cap exposure across all markets, and (2) predefined cap utilization thresholds that trigger simulations to determine whether cap adjustments are necessary. Operating under stricter constraints than those currently permitted at the Risk Steward contract level, this system introduces no additional permissions while significantly improving the observability and responsiveness of risk management. The initial deployment is planned for Arbitrum to start, to be expanded to other chains in the future.\n\n# Motivation\n\n### Current Cap Update Process\n\nThe current implementation of the Risk Steward contract allows for the manual, periodic updating of Supply and Borrow caps, generally performed in response to market demand. Such an implementation allows for the risk/reward of respective asset exposure to be quantified and assessed in a much quicker fashion as opposed to the traditional governance mechanisms in place. This creates the ability to perform cap increases every three days by up to a 100% relative change, alongside functionality to react to adverse events or liquidity crunches through cap exposure decreases to any nominal value.\n\nWhile the implementation of the Risk Steward contract allows such risk configurations to be optimally managed in a more efficient manner, this manual integration creates significant operational overhead to maintain the state of relative demand across all Aave markets. This is currently performed through the following process:\n\n1. Manually identify a necessary cap assessment and potential alteration through internal alerting systems.\n2. Run internal supply and borrow cap risk simulations for the asset, determining the optimal increase or decrease with respect to the defined constraints at the Risk Steward level.\n3. Create a forum post outlining the imminent cap change(s) and the associated rationale for such increases through a risk report that references the state of the asset’s Aave market.\n4. Obtain the calldata and create a transaction for the cap change.\n5. Execute the cap change after a final security verification by BGD (2/2 Safe)\n\nThe high volume of updates, combined with the manual triggering of supply and borrow cap simulations, written analyses, and coordination across multiple service providers, often leads to delays in implementing cap increases. These delays can hinder potential growth opportunities for underlying assets that might otherwise contribute significantly. Additionally, the reliance on manual monitoring to address liquidity crunches for specific assets and chains adds further inefficiency. For context, since October 1, 2024, a total of 178 manual cap updates and 49 written analyses have been conducted across all instances.\n\n![image - 2025-02-03T010936.218.png](ipfs://bafkreibuloniitunlqaov72bnkc5oembjewu66dorrgnc26yzprj3hbgiu)\n### **Edge - Risk Oracle**\n\nThe Supply and Borrow Cap Risk Oracle automates the process of generating and applying cap recommendations for Aave, leveraging our underlying simulation engine being utilized today to perform manual cap changes through the Risk Steward. Depending on whether the cap utilization surpasses or falls below specific thresholds, either the cap increase or cap decrease simulation is triggered, in addition to the frequent time-based triggering of simulations for all respective markets. The simulation then determines the optimal new cap value based on a range of risk metrics. Once calculated, the updated cap is automatically published to the contract, where it is directly applied to the market, updating the cap value in real-time.\n\nThe following section provides a more detailed technical overview.\n\n- **Cap Increases**\n    - The risk oracle is triggered when the median cap utilization exceeds the defined utilization threshold for a full day.\n    - The simulation stress-tests larger supply and borrow caps, taking into account the current state of the protocol, user positions, and external factors such as liquidity availability on the chain and the general circulating supply.\n    - **Parameter Adjustments**:\n        - **Supply Cap**: Recommend a new supply cap, if the risk allows.\n        - **Borrow Cap**: Recommend a new borrow cap, constrained by its ratio to the current supply cap. If the current supply cap does not support an increase, a new supply cap will be recommended (if the risk allows) to support the new borrow cap.\n- **Cap Decreases**\n    - Decreasing cap exposure through the risk oracle is triggered with two different components of the model:\n        1. Dynamic decreases resulting from asset liquidity depreciation and/or an unhealthy set of positions within the market. The simulation stress-tests the current supply and borrow caps for all assets on a weekly cadence, taking into account the current state of the protocol, user positions, and external factors such as liquidity availability on the chain and the general circulating supply. If the current nominal cap value is deemed too risky, the simulation will determine the optimal decrease value as a function of the aforementioned components.\n        2. Deterministic decreases as a result of low cap utilization within a respective market when the monthly utilization falls below a specified threshold. To ensure a conservative approach, utilization must stay below these thresholds for at least 90% of the time. In such cases, the cap will be halved, leading to a maximum updated utilization of 50% for Supply Caps and 30% for Borrow Caps. The cap can only be reduced down to a fixed minimum value.\n    - **Parameter Adjustments**:\n        - **Supply Cap**: Recommend a new supply cap, depending on the associated risk defined in (1), and ensuring it can still support the current borrow cap in (2)\n        - **Borrow Cap**: Recommend a new borrow cap.\n- **Update Frequency**:\n    - Adjustments are made when utilization or the general market state requires it, with a minimum of 3 days between updates.\n- **Monitoring and Transparency:**\n    - All adjustments will be transparent and auditable, with data available for community review.\n\n### Risk Oracle Permissions\n\n- The risk steward contract currently enforces the following constraints:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Percent change allowed** | **minimumDelay** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply Cap | +100% (increase) | 3 days |\n| Borrow Cap | +100% (increase) | 3 days |\n\nThe proposed modification to the current flow of cap updates automates the process of leveraging our currently manually utilized risk simulations to increase such caps. As such, in the proposed specification, the associated percent change allowed will be set at a more conservative +30%, with an equivalent minimum delay adhered to at the Risk Oracle level. All supply and borrow cap update events emitted can be observed in our Risk Oracle dashboard [here](https://edgebychaos.com/risk-feeds/aave). As this system will minimize the amount of manual overhead for each cap increase performed, we aim to provide periodic performance reports for the DAO.\n\nThrough the integration on Arbitrum, the following 15 markets fall under the specification:\n\n![image - 2025-02-03T010941.873.png](ipfs://bafkreieiddfslmk2up55jpwgvaxsv4zwnem3pimbv3pggsfxbi3c2jjnni)\n[Chaos Labs Arbitrum Risk Dashboard](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Arbitrum-main/listed-assets)\n\n### Growth/Speculative Assets\n\nWhile the Risk Oracle is designed to establish a generalized system for automated cap increases within the proposed constraints, certain speculative, growth-oriented assets—such as ezETH on Arbitrum—cannot be standardized in this manner. These assets inherit external ad-hoc inputs, preferential considerations, and limiting risk configurations at the protocol level. As a result, the Risk Oracle will not be used to recommend cap increases for such assets. Instead, they will continue to be manually assessed using the existing method employed through the Risk Steward contract. Additionally, manual stewards will remain as a fallback mechanism when deemed necessary, ensuring continuity with the current implementation.",

        "body": "## Overview\n\nThis proposal continues on the proposed steps from [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719) by recommending the removal of sUSD as collateral on Aave V3’s Optimism. Additionally, we recommend reducing the LT and LTV of the Stablecoin E-Mode on Optimism, which sUSD is part of, and setting sUSD LTV to 0.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis recommendation follows the recent proposal to reduce the supply and borrow cap of sUSD to 10m and 1, respectively; that recommendation follows a period of reduced sUSD DEX liquidity, which dropped to a buy-side low of $2M before recovering after the introduction of token incentives.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151805.225.png](ipfs://bafkreihgsfq3rklem3uewkfzhpofau2fc7mkp742shace72sae7aay3d7i)\nDuring this period, shorting activity on sUSD was observed between January 9th and January 15th. Following the implementation of token incentives on January 16th, as detailed in [this announcement](https://x.com/synthetix_io/status/1878944713446924552), these short positions were closed, and new borrowing demand primarily came from users farming the newly introduced incentives.\n\nBelow, we present a table of the current sUSD borrows on Aave and the associated strategy exposure. The distribution of such strategies seems to be quite dispersed, with the recent incentive structure leading to demand to create perpetual positions on Synthetix coupled with liquidity pool growth rather than short positions.\n\n| User | Action | Size | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0xD8b88C185e06eBF8C58B7dc8b7AFf18304CdD888 | Short | 350k | Jan 9 to Jan 15 |\n| 0x49bf093277bf4dde49c48c6aa55a3bda3eedef68 | LP | 150k | 16th |\n| 0x407cff84eeaacda390fe302c99fa5dd32521bc53 | Holding | 400k | 16th |\n| 0xe31deacee1770dfa56f8849724bcb7f8e5f76ef2 | LP | 130k | 16th |\n| 0xf7ca1f0ff0995c84fef530f7c74c69fb80331e81 | Perp | 200k | 16th |\n| 0x9644a6920bd0a1923c2c6c1dddf691b7a42e8a65 | Perp+LP | 750k | 16th |\n| 0xfd81b27d9796a1ba7d7171ea70010c9befb2a62a | Perp | 380k | 17th |\n\n### Peg Dynamics and Mechanism Design\n\nAn analysis of the peg and utilization dynamics revealed that the deviation can be attributed to a combination of multiple factors, including traders profiting from the Synthetix Perpetual platform, the lack of interest rate on sUSD debt in an environment of heightened rates, and the ongoing migration to Synthetix V3 which reduces the demand for sUSD. This created an imbalance as this excess supply was not met with proportional demand, putting downward pressure on the price of sUSD. This conclusion is supported by the increase in sUSD’s market cap, which closely followed the downward price deviation and the growth in interest rates.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151807.732.png](ipfs://bafybeicynmyw2iywjymc2s6lbeyjbavpcvsdwnqpwxoz2fnd3av36u3kkm)\nWhile this behavior does not pose a risk to sUSD’s fundamental backing, the exit of sUSD’s price from its concentrated liquidity range reduced buy-side liquidity, thereby increasing Aave's risk to sUSD positions. This liquidity constraint underpinned the recommendation to reduce caps, aiming to mitigate Aave's risk.\n\n### Removing sUSD as Collateral\n\nWith the recent deterrence of the creation of new sUSD debt on Aave and continued minimized supply exposure, the majority of outstanding debt is fundamentally leveraged to explicitly contribute to the recent sUSD incentive programs by minimizing effective peg exposure. However, while highly overcollateralized, the current economics associated with the soft peg mechanism is fundamentally shaky; minimizing the usage of sUSD as collateral is recommended to be performed as a preventive measure. The current distribution of such sUSD-collateralized stablecoin debt positions is highly conservative, as can be seen below, thereby requiring a significant depeg to start to contribute negatively to the Aave protocol, and the expectation is such that exposure will continue to be minimized over time, as has been the case with a 3M reduction in supply on Aave (25%) over the last 7 days.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151810.268.png](ipfs://bafkreichtqxkc33sgfqdmovkfkb52lal52eksh3ynamdjoghnkt333o3fe)\n![image - 2025-01-30T151812.842.png](ipfs://bafkreifmjwarbys4s3iecgetat2nmeyxp22qa4r7jyjbsru2qlrrpapvdy)\nMoreover, during a swift depeg event 7 months ago, we proposed an immediate LTV0 change due to the deprecation of their spot synths contributing to significant downward pressure, as can be seen [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719). The fundamental characteristics of the asset eventually improved once more through mechanical changes on Synthetix’s side in the redemption process, leading to the unfreezing of the asset, as seen in [this](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-parameter-recommendations-susd-on-v3-optimism-05-23-2024/17779) post. However, we continued to reduce exposure in the form of decreasing caps significantly coupled with decreasing LTV/LTs in both the general market and E-Mode configuration, leading to a more conservative state. As such, a significant buffer of 6% price movement already exists between the collateral value at the LT and the bad debt threshold of 1/(1+LB) in e-mode itself.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo further improve this safety buffer and given the conservative distribution of collateralized debt positions throughout the stablecoin E-Mode config on Optimism, we recommend decreasing the LTV/LT in Stablecoins E-Mode while minimizing induced liquidations.\n\nConsidering the current positioning within the E-Mode, we estimate the optimal LT reduction to be 87%. While we intend to deprecate the E-Mode and remove sUSD from it progressively, this change poses an initial step in that direction. Chaos Labs will monitor the market and introduce additional Liquid E-Modes if demand for a stablecoin-correlated E-Mode remains.\n\nThe change to 87% LT is expected to cause the liquidation of just $95K of collateral.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151815.223.png](ipfs://bafkreihlu36ppeeaml3zkpfe7vuf2iqfakfent4yzb2n3i3xqnpw7ixwpm)\nThe liquidations caused at the recommended LT are primarily stablecoins with significant liquidity to support the minimal liquidation size, with sUSD liquidations only representing $2.4K, or 3.2%.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151817.770.png](ipfs://bafkreieomtso2cfoswuhmg6ehmc4sdsxd3wrrdtgicbzd57u44tgetqlmu)\nAdditionally, we recommend setting the LTV of sUSD outside of the Stablecoin Correlated E-Mode to 0; this measure will prevent additional borrowing from being performed using sUSD as collateral, hence limiting the future risk posed by an sUSD downward deviation. \n\nThis measure will simultaneously apply to both sUSD parameters within and outside of the E-Mode, hence limiting the opening of new positions.\n\nFollowing an improvement of the sUSD peg and a reduction in sUSD-denominated collateral, Chaos Labs will reinstate the borrow cap to a defined value determined by our methodology.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the sUSD asset on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Asset | Deployment | Current LTV | Rec. LTV |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sUSD | Optimism | 60.00% | 0.00% |\n\nFor the Stablecoin E-Mode on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Rec. Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LTV | 90.00% | 0.00% |\n| LT | 93.00% | 87.00% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
