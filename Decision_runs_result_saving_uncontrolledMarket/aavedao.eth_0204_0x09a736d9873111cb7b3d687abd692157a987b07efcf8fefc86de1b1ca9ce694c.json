        "body": "---\n\n### [TEMP CHECK] Deploy an Ethena Aave v3 Instance\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-15\n\n---\n### Summary:\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on providing liquidity for sUSDe and USDe holders to borrow stablecoins.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEthena’s USDe stablecoin has grown to over $3b TVL with success as a supply and borrow asset on the mainnet Aave v3 instance. It has also seen large demand for use as collateral on other lending protocols.\n\nIn order to capitalize on this demand, we propose deploying a dedicated Aave v3 instance for Ethena’s stablecoins and related collateral assets. \n\nTo start the instance will use sUSDe and USDe as main collateral assets, with USDC, DAI and USDT as supply assets. \n\nWe also propose providing the Ethena instance with an initial GHO facilitator. \n\nThe goals for this instance will be to grow Aave market share for borrowers using sUSDe and USDe as well as create an additional steady revenue stream of GHO. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Ethena Aave v3 instance will implement the following:\n\n- The market will include sUSDe, USDe, USDC, DAI, USDT and a new GHO facilitator. Additional assets to consider during ARFC are Ethena’s Pendle PT tokens and rsUSDe.\n- This GHO facilitator will be limited in size to start both to limit risk to Ethena collateral and protect liquidity and the GHO peg.\n- The market will have stablecoin E-Mode to allow for high leverage borrowing between the correlated assets.\n- The market will use the existing sUSDe and USDe capped oracles, so that borrowers are not affected by fluctuations in the secondary market price.\n- Borrow parameters will match the mainnet Aave v3 instance, making it the most competitive location to borrow against sUSDe and USDe.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated by Ethena for the publication of this proposal.\n\nACI team members are holders of sUSDe, USDe and ENA.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

As productive assets, staking tokens are high quality collateral to borrow against.\n\nGiven their high correlation to ETH, LRTs are commonly used as collateral to borrow ETH and engage in yield leveraged staking, with several communities having built products that automate such strategies on top of Aave. The introduction of eMode only made such strategies more popular.\n\nThe onboarding of ezETH will consequently create increased ezETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of ezETH.\n\n## **Chain to be deployed/listed**\n\nEthereum mainnet.\n\n## **Relevant KPI & Points Rewards**\n\nRenzo awards ezPoints and EigenLayer Restaked Points based on users’ ezETH holdings. Every user that deposits ezETH as collateral in Aave will also be awarded ezPoints and EigenLayer points 1:1.\n\nAs relevant KPI for the Protocol:\n\n- Total Value Locked: $1.9 billion\n\n- Total supply: 526K+ Renzo Restaked ETH\n\n- 24H trading volume: $80,203,780\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[Renzo Protocol](https://www.renzoprotocol.com/)\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.renzoprotocol.com/docs)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol)\n\n[Audits](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol/contracts-public/blob/master/Audit/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment.pdf)\n\n[Chainlink Data Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ezeth-eth)\n\n[Composable Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Renzo Protocol for creating this proposal.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is Yae, escalate to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

    "summary": "This proposal recommends increasing the community preference supply cap for Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) from 75% to 90% of total supply across Aave markets. It responds to observed growing demand and usage patterns for LSTs, especially on networks like Base, Scroll, and Polygon, where Aave is a primary holder of these assets. Risk assessments indicate manageable liquidation risks due to CAPO oracles and sufficient liquidity in relevant markets. Similar past proposals raising caps also passed with strong support and positive market outcomes, reinforcing this decision.",
    "key_arguments_for": [
      "Increasing supply caps aligns with strong observed demand and induced supply growth in Aave markets for LST/LRT assets.",
      "Risk analysis by experts (Chaos Labs, LlamaRisk) finds minimal increased risk and manageable liquidation profiles.",
      "Historical similar proposals for related parameter increases passed decisively and supported network growth.",
      "Sufficient on-chain liquidity exists on Base and Scroll markets to support liquidations and mitigate risks."
    ],
    "key_arguments_against": [
      "Forum sentiment analysis shows overall negative sentiment, reflecting concerns about concentration risks and liquidation challenges.",
      "Potential risks include liquidity constraints in some L2 markets and the need for ongoing monitoring and responsive risk management.",
      "A few forum comments express caution about the dynamic nature of supply cap increases and potential systemic risks."
