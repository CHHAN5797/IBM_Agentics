        "body": "&nbsp;\n\n## Simple summary\n\nProposal for the approval of an interim distribution of 300’000 stable-coins from the Aave Collector to allow partial withdrawals by aAMPL suppliers to Aave v2 Ethereum, consequence of the problem detected end 2023.\n\nAdditionally, this proposal will include technical updates on the AMPL reserve to better settle accounting for this distribution.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn December 2023, a problem was detected on the AMPL custom reserve on Aave v2 Ethereum, causing an unexpected inflation of AMPL-related balances and supply, not following the intended design by the Ampleforth team.\n\nWhile further analysis is performed for the most reasonable strategy on giving withdrawal liquidity for aAMPL supplies, an interim distribution of 300’000 USD value is proposed as lower threshold, to allow aAMPL suppliers to proceed partially with their withdrawals.\n\nAlso, as follow-up of previous AIPs, this proposal will include extra steps of not create problems accounting wise.\n\nImportant to read the full context on https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Specification\n\nThe specific technical details will be defined at AIP stage once this ARFC will be approved, but high-level the payload will contain the following:\n\n- Activation of a USDC/USDT distribution on AaveMerkleDistributor contract used in the past for the Rescue Mission of assets that users mistakenly sent to Aave contracts. The claims of each account will be defined as the percentage of the aAMPL total supply each one holds.\n- Release of the 300’000 USD to the AaveMerkleDistributor.\n- Update on the Aave v3 Ethereum pool for any kind of technical update (exclusively affecting the AMPL reserve) deemed necessary by technical service providers of the DAO.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nBGD Labs is presenting this proposal within its engagement for technical services with the Aave DAO. Execution of it will depend exclusively on the decentralised Aave governance approving.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. In parallel with this Snapshot vote, preparing the final technical details of the AIP.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YES, escalate to on-chain AIP stage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to increase stablecoin Interest Rate parameters across all Aave deployments.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing the implementation of [AIP-375](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/375/) to increase stablecoin borrow rates across Aave V2 and V3 deployments, we continue to observe volatility in borrow rates across Aave deployments. As we [highlighted](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096/3) in the recent proposal, we recommend a more aggressive increase of the Slope1 parameter to stabilize borrows under the UOptimal point.\n\n### Previous IR Curve modification impact analysis\n\n**Stablecoins Total Supply and Borrow:** The data from the charts reflects an overall increase in both the supply and borrowing of stablecoins on the Ethereum V3 platform. From November 25th to December 12th we observed the following increases in supply and borrow across USDC, USDT, and DAI:\n \n![image](ipfs://Qma9SeLwfVs7v6gFVLdQsGR8pHWVkiK8xnNjncMLFmmKEe)\n    \nWe’ve observed an overall $49M increase (20.8%) in supply across USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum V3, and a $104M increase (45.4%) in borrows.\nThis general uptrend suggests that the AIP's changes were well received, with higher utilization for the assets following the parameter updates.\n\n![Frame 78017.png](ipfs://QmZrFJXLiYdXkHazHzhQU9ztciMZhbmZW91fosSsPbS2k3)\n\n \n![Frame 78018.png](ipfs://QmapwiVXKY9F8LAToEgAJMLTJUTD8qaHjM4jvHCtyCPfAF)\n    \n\n**Utilization Rate Analysis:** Our continuous monitoring of the utilization rates post AIP-375, setting Slope1 at 5%, shows sustained demand. When looking at the percentage of times in which utilization was above UOptimal, we can see that the AIP-375 increase didn’t stabilize the utilization at or below the UOptimal. This could also be due to changing market dynamics with the recent increase in crypto asset prices.\n\nDuring two distinct 16-day intervals, we observed the following:\n\n- **Pre-AIP-375 Period (11.09.23 - 11.25.23)**\n- **Post-AIP-375 Period (11.25.23 - 12.12.23)**\n\n**Percentage of Time of Utilization Above UOptimal:**\n\n| Asset | Before AIP-375 | After AIP-375 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USDC | 69.53% | 77.34% |\n| USDT | 63.02% | 33.09% |\n| DAI | 48.70% | 63.24% |\n\n \n![Frame 78019 (1).png](ipfs://QmeVmhQjvUfCyx8X1Dioriz5rmcMQNVP4xRr1bcGomF3Ye)\n    \nThe data demonstrates strong borrowing activity persisting after the interest rate curve adjustments, supporting a move towards higher interest rates. This pattern reflects a consistent, resilient demand among the top stablecoins on Ethereum V3.\n\n**Borrow Rate Analysis:** After executing the previous proposal, we continue to observe fluctuations in borrow rates, suggesting the previous increase did not achieve the anticipated stabilization. This situation suggests that further adjustments of the interest rate parameters are necessary to achieve more consistent and stable borrowing rates.\n\n \n![Frame 78020.png](ipfs://QmNRDSTSAK1TabFokii9ds53YVHf2kSYnFHiDQch2Ka5tA)\n    \n![403641469_370769045314386_6540288414402371375_n (1).png](ipfs://QmdnPzCUb37oWHbQPEShZrGnD3NxxTtWnRAZMpTZ63UHgR)\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Adjust Slope1 of stablecoins to 6%**\n\nThe analysis indicates a necessity for further refinement of stablecoin interest rates, to achieve a more predictable and stable borrowing rate with an equilibrium utilization under the UOptimal point. \nTherefore, we propose increasing Slope1 to 6% for stablecoins across all Aave deployments, in this iteration. Following this increase, we will continue monitoring the usage and equilibrium rate and make additional recommendations as necessary. \n\n# Specification\n\n| Market | Asset | Current Slope1 | Rec Slope1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | sUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | GUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDP | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | sUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC.e | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Base V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Metis V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Metis V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nApprove further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.\n\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.\n\nWhile Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.\n\nThis creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.\n\nFor the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.\n\n\n## Specification\nTo achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:\n\n- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.\n- All assets have to be withdrawn.\n\nTo minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.\n\n### Phase 1\nIn a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:\n\n- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).\n- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.\n- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).\n- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.\n- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.\n\nThe exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.\n\n### Phase 3\nOnce the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.\n\nIt is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.\n\n---\n\nAfter all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.\n\nFinally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the interest rate curves for AMPL on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs per the initial [forum post by BGD a few weeks ago](https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886), over the past few weeks, we have seen an abnormal exponential deviation within the AMPL market, particularly in the context of aAMPL/total supplied liquidity/vAMPL supply values. Although the exact cause of this shift is still under investigation, it appears linked to the unique aAMPL implementation. Specifically, the scaled total supply of the underlying AMPL in the market, and thus by proxy aAMPL supply, seems to rebase irrespective of the utilization rate, in addition to the high interest rates realized by the aAMPL. In the expected implementation however, suppliers and/or borrowers will proportionately receive daily AMPL rebases in accordance with the utilization of the underlying market (where utilization of 100% = zero to AMPL suppliers and 0% = only to AMPL suppliers).\n\nWith minimal withdrawals and 100% utilization rate over the last month and a half, it seems as though the correlation has only gotten stronger. Given the rampant growth in aAMPL supply whilst total supplied liquidity has stayed constant, & aAMPL withdrawals are naturally credited 1:1 with underlying AMPL, there is currently a predicament whereby current aAMPL holders cannot be paid out their effective claims on the market. The development of a fair method for distributing these claims, or any potential reimbursement strategy, will be formulated in the upcoming days and weeks, once we have a clearer understanding of the core issue. As such, given the AMPL market's frozen status since Nov 27th, 2022, and the ongoing deprecation of the market (including setting the RF to 99% on Dec 17th, 2023), suggesting a decrease in slope2 from 300% to 0% could alleviate the interest rate's impact on aAMPL supply growth, even if primarily realized by the Aave collector. This adjustment seeks to analyze the influence on the relative exponentiation within the current aAMPL supply, and would leave the 20% base rate intact.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n| Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Base | 20% | No Change |\n| Slope1 | 0% | No Change |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 0% |\n| Uoptimal | 80% | No Change |\n| Reserve Factor | 99.00% | 99.90% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "Title: [ARC] Ethereum v2 Reserve Factor - aFEI Holding Update \nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham \nCreated: 21-08-2022\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIn response to Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes redeeming all aFEI for FEI and exchanging it for DAI. \n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Aave DAO currently holds around 619,185.82 units of aFEI in the Ethereum Reserve Factor. Due to the uncertainty around the future of Tribe DAO and FEI, this proposal presents the community the opportunity to reduce exposure to the FEI stablecoin.  \n\nIf other lenders move to redeem aFEI for FEI before Aave DAO acts, then there is a risk that Aave DAO becomes trapped as a lender of last resort. Due to this risk, this proposal strongly encourages the DAO to redeem aFEI for FEI as an immediate priority.\n\nAfter redeeming the aFEI for FEI, risk can be further reduced by redeeming or swapping the FEI holding for a stablecoin with a more certain future. In this proposal, we suggest redeeming the FEI for DAI via the Tribe DAO Peg Stability Module which will incur a 0.03% fee.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe FEI lending market is a concentrated market with three main providers of liquidity. Tribe DAO, Aave DAO and Badger DAO make up the top three liquidity providers by providing 88.76%, 5.47% and 2.72% respectively. Fei Labs has proposed redeeming all aFEI for FEI which will remove [10,067,143.35](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaFBd7Bd91B4c1Dd289EE47a4F030FBeDfa7ABc12) units of FEI from the lending market. However, there are only ​​[9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units of FEI held within the lending market.\n\nFei Labs is unable to withdraw all of its FEI as there is insufficient liquidity, redeem amount [10,067,143.35](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaFBd7Bd91B4c1Dd289EE47a4F030FBeDfa7ABc12) > available liquidity​​ [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3). This is a problem for Fei Labs and also other lenders.\n\nThe market currently supports [11,308,536.17](https://etherscan.io/token/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units of aFEI, with 2,275,205.37 units of debt and [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) units available for lenders to redeem their collateral from or for Users to borrow. Any User seeking to claim [9,033,330.80](https://etherscan.io/address/0x683923db55fead99a79fa01a27eec3cb19679cc3) or less is able to do so now, but this may change very quickly when Fei Labs or others starts redeeming aFEI causing liquidity to diminish.\n\nAave DAO has 619,185.82 units of aFEI at risk of being caught in an illiquid position. If the FEI held within the lending market falls below 619,185.82 units before Aave DAO redeems its position, it will become a trapped lender until such time as borrowers repay their loans. It is likely that as this market is unwound by large liquidity providers redeem aFEI, that the utilisation and interest rate will increase, which hopefully triggering borrowers to repay loans.\n\nThis proposal has been put in motion to try to prevent Aave DAO becoming a trapped lender in the FEI market by redeeming its aFEI before liquidity dries up. We encourage all Users of the market to take responsible action in light of recent events.\n\nOnce the aFEI has been redeemed for FEI, it is to be redeemed for DAI. Tribe DAO offers a DAI PSM with a 0.03% fee that facilitates redeeming FEI for DAI. This is a simple solution and one [supported by the Tribe DAO community](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475) as part of the transition to a terminal state. The DAI PSM module has around $14.5M of liquidity at the time of writing and can be tracked [here](https://dune.com/queries/1187683). In the event that redeeming FEI for DAI runs into any issues, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve. There is a bonding curve at peer review stage for swapping USDC for BAL which can be amended to facilitate offloading FEI into the spot market. We will provide updates in the comments as the situation unfolds.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe below provides a broad, high level summary of how the aFEI position held within the Reserve Factor will be managed.\n\n* All of the aFEI held with the Ethereum Economic Reserve is to be redeemed for FEI.\n* All FEI will be redeemed for DAI via the Tribe DAO DAI PSM\n  * If any issue arises, FEI will be sold on market to DAI via a bonding curve\n* DAI will be held in the Ethereum Reserve Factor\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 25th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to proceed as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.\n\nIf we can move quicker than the proposed dates above, please do let reach out.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
