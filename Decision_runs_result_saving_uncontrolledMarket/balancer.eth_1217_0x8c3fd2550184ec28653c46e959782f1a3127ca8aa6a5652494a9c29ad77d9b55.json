        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/draft-proposal-balancer-subdaos-formation/2428).\n\n\n*This proposal is the culmination of a lot of hard work across the Balancer Community, with a special shout out needing to go to the Ballers. They have especially shaped this vision for BalancerDAO’s future, through their commitment, effort and belief in the protocol!*\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nBalancer DAO has grown organically, with interested contributors stepping up and helping out where they saw fit.

Up to this point, this approach to DAO organization has been successful. However, in order to continue to develop a sustainable, self-executing organization as the DAO grows, a more formal structure is proposed.\n\n**CORE PROPOSAL - subDAO Formation**\n\nThis proposal is for the inclusion of subDAOs into the existing DAO organization structure going forward.\n\nsubDAOs are autonomous groups of contributors empowered by BAL holders to act independently in the best interest of Balancer, within a certain area, with clearly defined decision making powers. subDAOs will have plenty of support from the rest of the DAO and the community itself.

Their formation does not need to be blessed or approved by anyone.\nWorking groups operate by:\n\n* A “Working group\" starts when someone/a group decides to work on something that will benefit the DAO.\n* Working groups do NOT have any powers delegated to them from BAL holders.\n* Compensation of working group contribution is handled by the Ops subDAO through balleries and coorindape circles.\n\n**DAO STRUCTURE**\n\nWe propose the following initial structure as part of this proposal.\n\n**![|624x515](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uVACFrtgTCC_I-lb-wVF2jAA-yeZNxzPelWgtBtc0RnpuhMkz7nXVmeUTtWXrb5sMlMhusqfzfu7A_i6q1y-snaPvKHpo3xDkT6b1oIURPbWdCDTnHD5NQNU6XVvVVfLuMDEBimi)**\n**![|624x515](upload://x5Ql711i1OJr6TRcGTPQJRKoH2Y.png)**\n**subDAOs Overview**\n\nsubDAO | Community Objective| Responsibility | Decision Making (consensus)|Contributors\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ops| Providing guidance and support to enable smooth DAO operations.|*People (onboarding, compensation, etc), *Quarterly Budget deployment, *Formally add/remove signers from other teams, *Reporting - communication DAO information (DAO activity, spending), *Communication standards (discord, notion) | 2 of 3 social| Signers^: Solarcurve Mkflow Mog|\n|Treasury| Advance the treasury| * Farming, *Meta-governance *Quarterly report| 3 of 4 social| Signers^: Solarcurve Xeonus Zekraken Luuke|\n| Partnership|Developing and supporting strong partnerships across the ecosystem.

Quarterly cycles are used for budget allocation, reporting, goal setting and alignment across the DAO.\n\nA learnings and review document will be created by each funded subDAO at the end of each cycle. These documents will be compiled into one document by the Ops subDAO for posting on the forum. Any unspent resources at the end of the cycle can be rolled over as part of the budget allocation for the next cycle.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nProposal Template:\n\n​​https://docs.balancer.fi/ecosystem/governance/governance-process\n\nBudget Breakdown:\n\n|Item|Amount in BAL|Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|1|100 |compensation|\n|2|200|events|\n|**Total**|**300 BAL**||\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT/MITIGATION**\n\n1. subDAO’s not held accountable\n\nsubDAOs could be formed that don’t generate any progress/ complete any work. Each subDAO is therefore responsible for creating a learning/review documents for presentation to the community at the end of each cycle, informing them of:\n\n* Work completed\n* Budget spend\n* Learning for next cycle\n* Planning undertaken\n\nThe report will provide the foundation for the subDAO being funded for the next cycle.\n\n2. subDAO’s operating outside of delegated responsibilities\n\nAny change to existing responsibilities ratified through this initial proposal will require the subDAO to present a Proposal to the community.\n\n**CONSIDERATIONS**\n\n1. The Grants subDAO and the DAO Multisig already exists within current Balancer DAO operations and their management practices won’t change.\n\n2. Decisions made by subDAO teams that require on-chain execution will still be performed by a multisig.\n\n3. It's important to note these subDAOs are not the only ones who can contribute to Balancer DAO. As needs arise or contributors step forward, new teams can and will form in the future. Any individual or group can contribute to Balancer DAO outside of the formalized teams.\n\n4. There is agreement that formation of a Treasury subDAO is required to optimize management of DAO’s treasury funds. This task requires a significant amount of evaluation, analysis and strategy. It is therefore proposed that the Treasury subDAO responsibilities will be restricted at the beginning, to allow further time to develop the underlying treasury framework. Future treasury function could include:\n\n* Tokenomics\n*  Reinvestment\n*  Diversification\n\n5. Delegating any new responsibilities (not listed in this proposal) into any of the subDAOs will require a new Proposal to be developed.\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**\n\n* Dec 2021 - Present draft subDAO proposal to community\n* Jan 2022 - Consolidate proposal feedback and post final Proposal + Vote\n* Feb 2022 - Structure + Budgets Live\n\nIt is proposed that the initial subDAOs (listed above) take full effect from 1 February 2022. This will allow a 2 month window for subDAO processes to be tested and refined before starting a quarterly cycle beginning 1 April 2022.\n\n**VOTING**\n\nThis proposal will be posted on the forum for 1 week prior to voting. Voting will then be open on Snapshot for three days. This vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote on the Proposal by selecting “Yes, let's do it” or “No, this is not the way”.\n\nVoting “Yes, let's do it” on this proposal means you support:\n\n* The formation of subDAOs within the Balancer DAO\n* Delegation of defined responsibilities to each subDAO listed above in the Proposal\n* The establishment of processes for developing, managing and dissolving of current/future subDAOs.",

        "body": "## Karpatkey Balancer Treasury CU Proposal\n\n## Background\n\nThis is a proposal to provide limited delegation of the Balancer treasury to [Karpatkey DAO](http://www.karpatkey.com) in a non-custodial, trust-minimised way.\n\nKarpatkey is a DeFi native DAO that has been constantly evolving to maximise capital efficiency, manage risk, increase security and optimise yield by combining industry-leading research with best-in-class tooling to prevent collateral liquidation. \n\nOur operation would be completely transparent at all times, and any member of Balancer DAO would be able to monitor it on-chain and through the weekly reports posted on the Balancer Forum. \\\nAlso, Karpatkey would suggest the creation of a Treasury Core Unit (CU) within Balancer DAO. If Balancer DAO approves this initiative, we would hire full time contributors to work exclusively with Balancer under our guidance and training. The scope of the CU would be determined after the assessment meetings where Karpatkey would find out Balancer’s needs. \\\nKarpatkey has been supporting Balancer since 2020, by being a top liquidity provider of ETH and stablecoins, and participating in governance, successfuly proposing a [GNO-BAL treasury swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/2110).\n\nAs a token of our long term commitment and financial alignment with Balancer, the performance fee (detailed below) would be charged in BAL and vested for 1 year. We intend to _hodl_ the collected BAL, and we would transparently report on our BAL holdings.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn order to focus on its core business, Balancer DAO must secure enough runway to keep developing its market-leading products, regardless of economic junctures. \\\nAn idle fund has a significant opportunity cost (e.g.: circa USD 120,000 a month for a $20M treasury at current market values). Therefore, delegating limited access of the treasury to a specialised DAO such as Karpatkey would optimise its growth through carefully curated and tailored strategies within a risk-controlled framework.\n\nThe chart below shows our past performance managing the treasury of our main user, GnosisDAO, when the main goal was to obtain a sustainable growth of funds with a low exposure to risk, before the focus was shifted to maximising the growth of the Gnosis Chain. As the chart illustrates, the yield obtained by Karpatkey’s strategies was greater than the yield of all the other DAOs in the ecosystem put together.\n\n![Karpatkey Participation Chart.jpg](ipfs://QmYtznUJRj7REvMnV2KgodwEiRTBDNB2b5mwLbgvBVRPgM)\nSource: [Autonolas](https://twitter.com/autonolas/status/1521853164638523397) independent research (link to original report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-3jTC3ycJYr2NzRFWeoQf4kb0EO2uMq/view))\n\n## Core Proposal\n### Trust-Minimised Fund Allocation Strategy\n\nThe process of fund allocation starts by Karpatkey DAO proposing a list of allowed protocols on Balancer DAO Snapshot, which must be approved by the majority of token holders. Once this happens, the target addresses and transactions’ call data associated with such protocols will be allowlisted in a smart contract, so that funds are always under Balancer DAO’s custody. As a result, Balancer DAO will have the power to withdraw or transfer funds without Karpatkey’s intervention.\n\nIf Balancer DAO has a specific need which wasn’t included in the approved strategy, such as incentives/rewards, payments, etc., Karpatkey would post another ad-hoc strategy including the additional services for Balancer DAO to approve. \\\nAn alternative would be to operate with trusted signers from Balancer, using the Safe multisignature wallet. Karpatkey would not hold enough signatures to be able to execute transactions on its own. Therefore, approval from Balancer signers would always be necessary.\n\nWe would put together a periodically reviewed emergency withdrawal protocol to be able to quickly derisk/liquidate/swap all positions in the event of a market crash, hack or any fortuitous event that requires to stop loss.\n\nKarpatkey DAO’s professional treasury development consists of carrying out tailored strategies that vary twice a week, adjusting to the constantly changing DeFi market.\n\n#### Daily Strategy Reevaluation \n\nEach step of the strategies would be designed and monitored daily by our research team, keeping in mind different risks and opportunities. \n\n#### Impermanent/Divergence Loss\n\nTo minimise the risk of Impermanent or Divergence Loss, we carry out the following tasks:\n\n* Identification of profitable and low IL pools (assessment of assets’ correlation evolution)\n* Definition of thresholds for exit strategies\n* Accurate IL tracking*, also considering different variations of deposited volumes  over time.\n\n*The way in which we calculate IL differs across protocols and specific cases within protocols, but it’s primordially based on the formula detailed below, which calculates the IL per LP token for any AMM with constant swap fees. Our Financial Engineering team is currently preparing a paper on  the equations that we use for IL calculation in different cases, encompassing single isolated financial positions and more complex positions including composability.\n\n### \n\n![IL Calculation.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifdeefejl4myrzqld2nzykkhg3yk6q2xrfwprumipk73hnz2r3ztq)\n\nImpermanent loss evolution tracking example:\n \n![IL Evolution.jpg](ipfs://bafkreihklmyqpr7qb72cct2it4jdvb442kvfjrcwd3o36gke33xhewzq5u)\n\n### Treasury Core Unit\n\nAfter reviewing Balancer DAO’s structure, we came to the conclusion that creating a Treasury Core Unit (CU) would increase the efficiency of the overall management of the tokens held in the treasury. If Balancer DAO agrees, this CU would be composed by full time contributors that would be sourced and recruited with Karpatkey DAO’s support. \\\nThe CU members would be trained and assisted by Karpatkey DAO, observing strict security standards. They could be on Karpatkey DAO’s payroll and would be in charge of the following tasks (among others):\n\n\n\n* **Balancer Value Proposition:** Improve the value proposition of Balancer and the Balancer DAO treasury\n* **Availability:** Increase Balancer availability on other networks and markets\n* **Liquidity:** Increasing Balancer liquidity so more traders and investors can acquire it with a lower price impact\n* **Balancer Health Monitoring:** Propose buybacks if we consider Balancer is undervalued\n* **Fund Proposals:** Any proposal involving funding will be comprehensively analysed by the CU to plan how token transfers should take place in a timeline, and ensure that liquidity requirements are met and executed properly\n* **Fund OPEX:** All of Balancer DAO’s operating expenses will be analysed and projected to meet liquidity requirements and make timely transfers if needed\n* **Drafting and Maintenance of an Emergency Token Withdrawal Protocol:** In case of a sudden black swan market event, the team will execute a carefully structured protocol to de-risk all positions and avoid losing funds. This protocol will be periodically updated to ensure it’s ready to be executed at all times\n* **Capital Optimisation:** CDPs will be continuously monitored and managed to prevent liquidation (more details in the Risk Management section below)\n* **Reporting:** Dashboard creation and maintenance to monitor the yield of investments, rewards distribution and overall treasury growth trend, health and diversification\n* **Bridge Monitoring:** analysis of funds allocation to allow the Balancer token to be transferred across networks without friction.\n\n### Yield Strategy\n\nThe yield strategy would vary weekly to keep it within target. It would resort to different combinations of staking derivatives solutions, AMM, same asset leveraged in money markets, carry trade, arbitrages, etc. Given the risk that it entails, we don’t do trading.\n\nIn alignment with Balancer’s treasury allocation policy, the strategy would not extract  value from directly competing protocols. The following protocols would be considered to obtain an adequately diversified yield strategy with low risk and reduced ETH price exposure. This is just a sample list, the final one would follow Balancer DAO’s preferences and risk profile:\n\nAave, Agave, Ankr, Aura, Balancer, Bancor, Compound, Element, Honeyswap, Idle, Lido, Liquity, Maker, Nexus Mutual, QiDAO, Reflexer, Rocket pool, Stakewise, Sushiswap, Swapr, Symmetric, Synthetix, Uniswap, Unit.\n\n### Reporting\n\nKarpatkey DAO will post a weekly treasury development report on the Balancer forum, and support in identifying data elements upon request from the Balancer community. Also, Karpatkey DAO would review data reported and assist in performing analytics and quality reviews to confirm the accuracy of the information.\n\nThe following metrics would be included:\n\n* **Portfolio Summary:** shows the current holdings in USD and ETH equivalent, considering the allocation by blockchain, as well as the allocation of the most relevant assets\n* **Revenues:** shows the performance of the portfolio strategy, displaying the current APR, annual revenues, capital utilisation and past performance\n* **Positions:** shows the complete strategy implemented for the considered time period, explaining the type of investments, protocols, underlying assets, expected APR and expected revenues\n* **Loans Management:** shows the loan strategy to quickly assess the health status of the active loans, considering the borrowed assets and funds, the lent assets and funds, the collateral ratio and the minimum (liquidation) collateral ratio\n* **Portfolio details:** shows the complete composition of the portfolio by type of asset\n* **Improvement Proposals:** shows the list of executed proposals, as well as a summary of the weight of each proposal\n* **Incentives program:** shows the incentives strategy, displaying the amount of assets used on each protocol.\n\n### Fees\n\nKarpatkey DAO will charge the following fees, which have been adjusted to make this proposal self-financing, without burdening Balancer DAO’s growth:\n\n#### Management fee\n\nA yearly management fee (in monthly instalments) of 0.5% of the AUM would be charged to finance fixed costs like hiring full time contributors to Balancer DAO.\n\n#### Performance fee\n\nWe’d charge a monthly performance fee of 20% of the yield obtained during the last month in BAL tokens, and every payment will have a vesting period of 1 year. We intend to hold it long term, as a token of our commitment to Balancer.\n\n### Termination\n\nBalancer may terminate Karpatkey DAO’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of Governance Mechanism. Kapatkey DAO may terminate this agreement upon four week’s notice posted as a new discussion thread in the Balancer forum. In case the termination is requested by Balancer without at least a 4 week notice, Karpatkey DAO will be granted an exit fee equal to the fees collected during the last 2 months, which will be paid in ETH. Regular fees will be collected until the day of termination.\n\n\n### Custody of Funds\n\nKarpatkey DAO is not a custodian of funds. The funds will be in possession of authorised signers of Balancer at all times. Karpatkey DAO will sign transactions using two addresses, which won’t suffice to execute transactions.\n\nKarpatkey DAO is not responsible for the loss of funds caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies with smart contracts or protocols which are not owned by Balancer or Karpatkey DAO.\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion by Balancer and may need to be (re)structured to take account of legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, Karpatkey DAO would post a yield strategy in Balancer’s Snapshot, holding a broad list of protocol options without granular specification of parameters nor exact moment when transactions would be executed. We would then operate within those boundaries, without having to go through a DAO-wide vote on every trade, while ensuring that only transactions approved by Balancer DAO could be carried out by Karpatkey DAO. \\\nAlternatively, at least one trusted signer should be appointed by Balancer to approve each transaction. This could be a member of the Treasury Core Unit.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Risk Management\n\nEvery decision made and action taken weighs in risk exposure. Most large treasury holders have one thing in common: risk aversion. At Karpatkey DAO, we go above and beyond standard risk assessment protocols, and we have developed a multilevel approach to curate yield strategies, assess protocols and carry out transactions safely.\n\n(see the full list of risk factors in the forum post due to max char. limit for Snapshot)",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/530\n\n**Summary**\n\nRestore brand trust in Balancer by assisting DNS hack users, allowing them to immediately recover 75% of lost funds, while Balancer continues to investigate this incident.  Users claiming immediate restitution shall forfeit all further claims relating to this incident, with any further recovery accruing to the Balancer DAO.\n\n**Background**\n\nOn September 19, the Balancer frontend was attacked via social engineering on EuroDNS, the domain register used for .fi TLDs.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1704281611326357567\n\nDue to prompt action from community members, damage was mitigated, and control was quickly restored.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1705250633782313431\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1704552285395894422\n\nUnfortunately, users interacting with the Balancer frontend while the attack was ongoing were affected.  Final damage numbers have not been published.  However, rough estimates would be around 200-300K USD.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nBrand trust is the public's perception of a brand's reliability and trustworthiness, as informed by both personal experience and marketing communication. It’s a complex concept that encompasses a variety of factors, including security and privacy, product quality, customer service, brand mission and values, and political or philanthropic efforts.  In crypto, brand trust is an important, and arguably the most vital, differentiator between comparable products in competitive market conditions.\n\nBrand trust is a critical component of brand loyalty. Customers who trust a brand are more likely to utilize it again, even if they have a negative experience from time to time or one-off experiences that don't meet their expectations.\n\nConsistency is another strong component of successful branding.  Communicating the same values in the same voice at every customer touchpoint--treating all users alike--is important in creating an authentic brand.  Inconsistent actions are unpredictable, and unpredictability dissuades consumers.\n\n[[BIP-XXX] Decide on direction of restitution for affected LPs in Boosted Pool Incident](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-decide-on-direction-of-restitution-for-affected-lps-in-boosted-pool-incident/5187) is an excellent example of striving to restore brand trust.  While Balancer is neither obligated to provide restitution, nor responsible for user actions, the community has nonetheless found it worthwhile to seek a resolution to the first hack and make its users whole.\n\nSimilar, Balancer should attempt to take any possible actions within its power to mitigate harm caused by the second hack as well to known, affected users.  We propose that verified actors affected by the DNS hack be allowed to claim 75% of their lost funds from Balancer while it continues to investigate this incident, forfeiting further claims to their lost funds, with any additional funds recovered going to the Balancer DAO.  By doing so, Balancer will be not only be able to restore, but grow its brand trust, which will be essential if it seeks to succeed in the long term.  In today's competitive marketplace, users have more choices than ever before, and are increasingly demanding, especially with consumer security and safety. Consumers want to interact with brands, like Balancer, that can provide a safe transactional environment and positive overall experience.\n\n**Specification**\n\nUpon approval of this BIP, immediately send $117,806.25 USDC (72.0528468675 ETH) to address 0xD14f076044414C255D2E82cceB1CB00fb1bBA64c, a verified, known, damaged wallet, who will be providing an on-chain signature for wallet verification referencing this BIP in the comments below, along with a statement forgoing all further claims to restitution.  The amount to be sent is 75% of the $157,075 USD (96.07046249 ETH) total lost by this wallet during the attack period across 5 transactions, which can be verified on chain [here](https://etherscan.io/address/auramaxi.eth).\n\nFurther:\n\n1.The max budget for this program shall be 350K USD.\n2. A 60 day reporting window shall by announced via appropriate channels, including Discord and Twitter, following approval of this BIP, with a second reminder at 30 days, and a final reminder in the final week to deadline.  The 60 day claim period will start upon announcement of the claim window.\n3. To submit claims, users will [verify wallet ownership](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures) and report any DNS hack losses via a Google Form, which shall be prepared by a volunteer committee of 5 well-qualified, objective individuals with experience in DeFi opsec, who shall serve as a technical advisory committee to process these transactions.  Because a widely used angel drainer was used in this attack, it's not possible to determine whether tokens drained during the timeframe of the attack were from user interactions with the Balancer FE or from elsewhere.  Some blockers can be put in place to prevent potential double-dipping from the attacker himself, such as gathering identifying information on the claim form.  But ultimately, whether a user making a claim was truly affected will come down to a human call.  If the committee reviews a claim, finds it satisfactory, submits a BIP, and governance approves that BIP, then that claim is legitimized.\n4. To validate and approve claims, the committee will verify the address and transaction details on Etherscan, arriving at an independent total to be compared against details submitted on the Google Form.  Should the details match, the claim shall be recommended for processing.  Should the details conflict, the claim will be rejected for resubmission.\n5. To execute, the committee will aggregate all claims in batches, and prepare two BIPs to be approved by governance--one BIP to be submitted 30 days after the start of the 60 day claim period announcement, the second BIP to be submitted at the 60 day deadline.  Each BIP shall include a list of affected wallet addresses and amounts, and be sent to the Balancer DAO signers on the following Tuesday after each BIP has been approved, who shall use transaction builder to execute one multi-send transaction to send the verified amounts to the affected wallets.\n6. Further claims following the 60 day period will require a new BIP and must go through governance.\n\n**Voting**\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of public relations campaigns, immediate action is necessary.  Consequently, we’d respectfully request that this BIP be moved to vote this week.\n\n### Technical specification\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the affected user address identified as auramaxi.eth as the recipient `0xD14f076044414C255D2E82cceB1CB00fb1bBA64c ` and amount `117806250000`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/904\n\n\n**TL;DR**\nWe propose utilizing idle treasury-owned BAL to engage in covered call lending using [MYSO Finance](https://www.myso.finance/): this would allow Balancer to generate significant stablecoin revenue, diversify part of its treasury and earn cash upfront without having to wait until loan expiry. In contrast to simply selling tokens, there's no immediate market impact. All loan execution happens through MYSO smart contracts and is trustless and fully transparent with full on-chain traceability.\n\n**Proposal author - MYSO Finance**\nMYSO is a decentralized peer-to-peer lending protocol that specializes in custom loans that allow users to borrow and lend with any ERC20 token. In addition, the protocol can support a wide range of different on-chain structured product strategies like synthetic token buybacks and covered calls. MYSO has recently facilitated several on-chain covered call strategies for treasuries/users, including one with [Telos treasury](https://medium.com/mysofinance/myso-x-telos-treasury-covered-call-strategy-launch-59f3a993dca7) and [Evmos community treasury](https://commonwealth.im/evmos/discussion/14699-generate-usdc-revenue-by-lending-part-of-evmos-treasury-through-covered-calls).\n\nThe protocol currently holds a [TVL of ~$2.2m](https://defillama.com/protocol/myso/) and is currently live on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Mantle, Evmos, Telos, Linea and Neon EVM. The protocol originated from the ETH Global Hackathon in 2021, where it was awarded as one of the [winners](https://ethglobal.medium.com/the-2021-year-in-review-e037a1e34c91). It is also [backed by several reputable crypto OGs](https://medium.com/mysofinance/myso-closes-2-4m-seed-round-2f4f8114144e), such as HashKey, Wintermute, and Nexo.\n\nSite - [https://myso.finance/](https://www.myso.finance/)\nDApp - https://app.myso.finance/\n\n**Abstract**\nBalancer has frequently engaged in treasury diversification efforts as well as deployment of BAL to various on-chain yield-generating strategies. The Balancer DAO still has a large sum of BAL tokens idle in the treasury and recent posts within the governance forums have mentioned the need to continue to actively deploy these funds to diversify/earn yield. \n\nTo support this endeavor, we propose using BAL to engage in covered call lending, allowing the treasury to generate USDC income. In contrast to conventional lending, the USDC is earned upfront, eliminating the need to wait until the loan matures. All loan execution happens through MYSO smart contracts and is trustless and fully transparent with full on-chain traceability. \n\nThe covered call lending parameters, such as loan duration and upside cap, can be customized according to individual treasury preferences to optimally serve the Balancer community. Unlike traditional CeFi-style covered calls which are oftentimes presented by market makers, this proposal allows Balancer to get access to a similar financial payoff but without any counterparty risk. This is because the borrower is required to post USDC collateral upfront, ensuring that Balancer never faces a situation where the upside cap price is not paid or the loaned BAL tokens are not returned. The upfront USDC income from lending BAL can be immediately utilized for community needs. And unlike a simple token sale, covered call lending enables the treasury to diversify its holdings into stable assets without any immediate market impact. \n\n**Proposal Features**\n**Utilize Idle Tokens**: Idle BAL tokens can be used to generate upfront USDC revenue\n**Full Customizability**: Covered call parameters (e.g., duration, upside cap, size etc.) can all be fully customized to optimally cater for Balancer's treasury preferences\n**No Market Impact**: Tokens don't need to be sold, thus there's no immediate market impact\n**Covered Call Yield**: Yield is generated through a covered call structure, where cash is paid upfront for lending BAL and implicitly [writing a call option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option) on the loaned tokens\n**Transparency**: Loan execution happens transparently on-chain using 3x audited MYSO smart contracts, without counterparty default risk\n\n**Benefits**\n* Immediate revenue and liquidity for operational and developmental activities\n* Diversification of the treasury into stables (e.g., multiple covered calls can be executed consecutively over a longer time period) \n* Unlike conventional covered calls or market maker loan arrangements, there is no counterparty risk\n\n\n**Example Scenario**\nBalancer treasury lends $250k worth of BAL for 60 days at a 110% upside cap (strike). In return, the Balancer treasury gets ~$18.75k USDC upfront (~46% APY). Then, at expiry, there are two possible outcomes:\n \n- If the BAL price remains below 110% after 60 days, the originally loaned BAL is returned. \n- If it exceeds 110%, Balancer treasury receives $275k USDC and also retains the upfront USDC.\n\nThe diagram below shows indicative upfront premiums that the Balancer treasury could earn across various loan duration (Days to Expiry) and upside cap (Relative Strike Level) combinations. Generally, the longer the loan duration and the lower the upside cap the higher the upfront premium Balancer can earn. Balancer can customize the covered call terms to their liking and choose from a number of different duration/upside cap combinations. Additional indicative prices can be provided upon request.\n\nThe premium for the example scenario above (110% upside cap, 60 day duration) is indicated in red (7.49% upfront)\n\n \n![myso1.png](ipfs://bafkreigfbi3raqtjb2rro2rwneuisz5gtqubxghnf3zdecdhnnej2jfq5i)\n    \n\n**How does a Covered Call work?**\nBelow is a diagram illustrating the payoff of a covered call for BAL tokens and how it compares to simply holding. A simple holding strategy results in a linear payoff (green line).\n\nFor instance, if BAL increases by +10%, the gain is +10%, and if it decreases by -10%, the loss is -10%. On the other side, the covered call payoff line (blue line) also follows a linear shape but only up to the upside cap, beyond which the gain is capped.\n \n![myso2.png](ipfs://bafkreiefihge6ssbc4hwjxfjpwu6taxyvi2ylh5glxtfviv4fa4rpv3pya)\n    \n\nNote how the covered call payoff line is shifted upwards by the USDC upfront premium received for lending BAL, regardless of how the price of BAL moves. This means that in all cases where the BAL price remains below the upside cap, the outcome of the covered call will always be better. Only when the price exceeds the upside cap would holding lead to a better outcome. From an overall risk perspective, this implies that the downside risk with a covered call is lower than holding BAL.\n\nFor example, even in the unlikely case where BAL were to drop by -100%, the covered call would have returned a better result because the upfront USDC cash would have been received in any case. Hence, the downside risk of doing a covered call is actually lower than simply holding BAL.\n\n**Where Does the Yield Come From?** \nWhen Balancer lends through a covered call, it essentially lends treasury tokens and writes a call option. The borrower, on the other hand, buys the call option and has the right - but not the obligation - to return BAL tokens. To initiate the loan, the borrower first needs to send USDC to (1) pay for the upfront premium to the Balancer treasury and (2) provide collateral for cases where the borrower doesn't repay. \n\nFor example, if Balancer lends $250k worth of BAL for a 7.49% premium for 60 days with a 110% upside cap, the borrower needs to send ~$18.75k USDC for the upfront premium and $275k USDC as collateral, totaling ~$293.75k USDC. \n\nAt the loan's inception, the Balancer treasury would receive $18.75k USDC immediately and keep it no matter what, and at expiry, two scenarios can happen:\n \n(i) BAL price doesn't increase by more than 10% after 60 days, in which case it's rational for the borrower to return the borrowed BAL tokens and retrieve the $275k USDC collateral\n\n(ii) If the BAL price increases by more than 10% after 60 days, it's rational for the borrower not to return BAL tokens, resulting in an unlock of the pledged $275k USDC, which becomes claimable by the Balancer treasury. \n\nIt's uncertain whether or not the BAL price will exceed the upside cap. One can use option pricing theory to determine a fair value for the embedded upside potential using the [Black-Scholes model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model). \nThe USDC upfront premium that Balancer would receive (in this example $18.75k) compensates for selling this embedded upside potential or call.\n\n**How can the Balancer treasury lend BAL via Covered Call?**\nApart from programmatic execution, the Balancer treasury can use the MYSO DApp [https://app.myso.finance/] to carry out a covered call transaction. The first step is to create a “lender vault” (see screenshot)\n\n[createVault function can be inspected here on Etherscan\n](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1874a08F7975b25944FEb989BbAaA464f61aB3bc#writeContract)\n\n \n![myso3.png](ipfs://bafkreid7t5ykmw57spmxyc554zx2bqrafpgyqlfj4av4iscsu4nuwemqoa)\n    \n\nOnce a lender vault has been created, the treasury can then fund the vault by adding BAL tokens as assets to lend. Once the vault has been funded, one can then create a covered call loan offer according to the target terms.\n\n \n![myso4.png](ipfs://bafkreiftq6237itvu37mpgqwejjrwazqc2mehwvlkinlzzgvotxhx2g2lq)\n    \n\nOn the ‘Create Covered Call’ page, you can add your desired upside cap, loan tenor, and upfront premium.\n\n[addOnChainQuote method can be inspected on Etherscan here\n](https://etherscan.io/address/0x71E1cc2F7574C798ED893Ef04D55D1E573bE95B1#writeContract)\nOnce the loan offer has been created, it will become visible on the borrow page. Through MYSO’s OTC network, loan terms can be discussed and matched with institutional borrowers beforehand, so that when the offer is created, the Balancer treasury can be certain that the borrower will take the loan offer within a few hours. In case the borrower doesn't execute the loan for any reason, Balancer can withdraw the funds at any time. Additionally, the loan offer can be created with a deadline, meaning that it automatically invalidates after a certain time. Lastly, the loan offer can also be parameterized to be executed only by a certain counterparty if desired.\n\n**How secure is it to do covered calls?** \nMYSO has undergone three independent rigorous audits with leading security experts from Statemind, Omniscia, and Trail of Bits. All audit reports are publicly available and can be seen here:\n \nStatemind: [https://github.com/statemindio/public-audits/blob/main/Myso%20Finance/2023-08-15_Myso_v2.pdf] \nOmniscia: [https://omniscia.io/reports/myso-finance-lending-protocol-644911cef1412d00142bf698/] \nTrail of Bits: [https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-04-mysoloans-securityreview.pdf] \n\nMoreover, as mentioned earlier in the proposal, one of the benefits of using MYSO for covered calls is the absence of counterparty risk. MYSO provides access to covered calls in a trustless manner, eliminating the need to trust the borrower.\n\n**Technical Specifications**\nThe Balancer LM multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the MYSO Vault Factory token contract at `0x1874a08F7975b25944FEb989BbAaA464f61aB3bc` and `call createVault(bytes32 salt)` passing in `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` as the salt. \nThis will create a vault clone with address `0xdC84A5e6Bf288af75CC821226634644Ed6a7aB54`. \n\nThen, the aforementioned Balancer multisig will call transfer on BAL Token at contract address `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` with to address being newly created vault address `(0xdC84A5e6Bf288af75CC821226634644Ed6a7aB54`) and amount being `25000_000000000000000000` ($94,000 USD at current spot price of ~$3.76)\n\nThe last interaction would be to create the actual quote - here would be the example transaction for a quote at 120% strike, 5% upfront premium for 30d tenor:\nBalancer LM multisig (`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`) would call `addOnChainQuote` function on `quoteHandler` at address `0x71E1cc2F7574C798ED893Ef04D55D1E573bE95B1` with params\n\n\n```\nlenderVault: 0xdC84A5e6Bf288af75CC821226634644Ed6a7aB54,\nonChainQuote: {\n\tgeneralQuoteInfo: {\n\t\tcollToken: 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48,\n\t\tloanToken:  0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D,\n\t\toracleAddr: 0x90B9eA01b1c0E2A1b95B03DFBb8E2A4b3F903bfC,\n\t\tminLoan: 20000_000000000000000000,\n\t\tmaxLoan:  100000_000000000000000000,\n\t\tvalidUntil: 1735779846,\n\t\tearliestRepayTenor: 0,\n\t\tborrowerCompartmentImplementation: \t\t\t\t\t0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,\n\t\tisSingleUse: true,\n\t\twhitelistAddr: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,\n\t\tisWhitelistAddrSingleBorrower: false\n\t\n\t},\n\tquoteTuples:[\n\t\tquoteTuple:{\n\t\t\tloanPerCollUnitOrLtv: 800000000000000000,\n\t\t\tinterestRatePctInBase: 0,\n\t\t\tupfrontFeePctInBase: 40000000000000000,\n\t\t\ttenor: 2592000\n\t\t\t\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\tsalt:  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n**Specification**\nThe above parameters are an estimate/example transaction since the upfront fee/premium could change depending on the recent BAL volatility following the proposal being approved.\n\nWe propose utilizing 25,000 BAL tokens as the notional amount (~$94,000 USD at current spot price of ~$3.76) and utilizing either a 110% or 120% upside cap (strike). \nWe propose running the strategy at either a 30 or 60 day tenor and repeat the strategy over the course of 6 months to start - the tenor for each transaction would depend on the upfront premium, and we’d push towards securing a tenor for which the premium would result in highest annualized yield. \n\nWe also propose to never quote below a 2.5% premium on 120% strike (~30.4% APY) and below 4.0% premium on 110% strike (~48.7% APY) for a 30 day tenor strategy. \nIn addition, we propose never to never quote below 4.0% premium on 120% strike (~24.3% APY) and below 5.5% premium on 110% strike (~33.5% APY) for a 60 day tenor strategy.\n\nOnce the proposal is approved and the Balancer LM multisig seeds their bespoke vault with the 25,000 BAL, no other active management will be needed apart from settling on a quote and creating new offers after each strategy expiry. \n\n\n**Conclusion** \nThis proposal has outlined how Balancer can generate USDC cash revenues by using idle BAL treasury for covered call lending. This approach not only diversifies the treasury but also avoids market impacts that could arise from outright selling BAL. The flexibility in structuring loan terms allows Balancer to tailor the initiative according to its unique risk-reward preferences, ensuring alignment with its broader financial and operational objectives. \n\nWe look forward to hearing your comments and feedback and would love to assist in pushing this proposal to voting!",
