The sUSDe/USDC pool is 50% yield bearing and will be a core pool.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\n* Website: [Ethena.fi](https://www.ethena.fi/)\n* Documentation: [Ethena documentation](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/)\n* Twitter: [Twitter links](https://twitter.com/ethena_labs/status/1759546702187696437?s=20)\n* [Fundraising news](https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_/status/1759546368467849577?s=20)\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nEthena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the ‘Internet Bond’.\n\nEthena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.\n\nUSDe peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral.\n\nsUSDe is the staked version of USDe which earns yield from the protocol.\n\nUSDe has already seen extensive use throughout DeFi, making this an interesting asset to onboard to Balancer.\n\nFor example, liquidity on Curve is already over >100m:\n\n* [https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena ](https://dune.com/hildobby/ethena)\n* [https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank ](https://dune.com/hodlduck/ethena-rank)\n* [https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde ](https://dune.com/noxiousq/ethena-usde)\n\nUSDe is currently the 4th highest volume asset in the whole of Ethereum behind ETH, USDC, USDT: [Uniswap Interface ](https://app.uniswap.org/explore)\n\n## Motivation:\n\nBalancer is seeking to establish the sUSDe/USDC as a main liquidity source for users wishing to swap sUSDe to USDC and avoid the 7-day delay for unstaking. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Ethena community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nUSDe derives its peg stability from executing automated and programmatic delta-neutral hedges with respect to the underlying collateral assets.\n\nHedging the price change risk of the collateral asset in the same size ensures the change in value of the collateral asset is offset by the change in value of the hedging leg.\n\nThis ensures the synthetic USD value of the collateral remains relatively stable in all market conditions.\n\nConsidering the recent launch of sUSDe and current scaling plans, further proposals will suggest conservative LTVs and borrow caps in order to thoughtfully scale sUSDe as collateral.\n\n## Key Information\n\n* Users are able to acquire USDe in permissionless external liquidity pools.\n* Approved parties from permitted jurisdictions who pass KYC/KYB screening are able to mint & redeem USDe on-demand with Ethena Labs contracts directly which will include only market making entities.\n* There is no reliance upon traditional banking infrastructure as trustless collateral is held and stored within the crypto-system. USDe is fully backed by users’ deposits at all times.\n* Users are also able to complete Cross Market Arbitrage by minting & redeeming USDe with Ethena and trading USDe in external markets such as Binance or Curve pools to capture price dislocations.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe protocol is exposed to various risks including but not limited to:\n\n* Smart Contract Risk\n* External Platform Risk\n* Liquidity Risk\n* Custodial Operational Risk\n* Exchange Counterparty Risk\n* Market Risk\n\n## Governance:\n\nEthena currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to shards holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\n## Oracles:\n\nThe Ethena system is split between onchain and offchain components. It does not use any onchain oracles at the moment as all pricing is external to onchain price fees with centralized perpetual markets, but we do use extensive offchain data sources from multiple providers.\n\nEthena Labs relies on price feeds in order to price the mint and redeem USDe requests per the available derivatives market liquidity as well as manage the risk of our derivatives positions. Real-time data feeds indicate not only where it delegates collateral, but the various risk profiles between the exchanges.\n\nWith this in mind, it's critically important that Ethena has access to & is constantly consuming real-time price feeds, especially from where it matters most; the exchanges where it holds derivatives positions due to their margin requirements.\n\nEthena consumes real-time pricing information from three primary sources:\n\n* CeFi Exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Okx, Deribit, Bitmex and Bitget.\n* Pyth.\n* Redstone\n\nThis real-time data is used extensively throughout the system to apply business logic, but to also ensure the integrity of all actions.\n\n## Audits:\n\nEthena has undertaken a multi-phased audit program to ensure the highest level of security on the procotol.\n\n* Phase 1: conducted initial audit with Zellic on the v1 of the protocol where no critical or high level vulnerabilities were found.\n* Phase 2: architecture design review and economic risk factor analysis with Spearbit's Kurt Barry former Lead Engineer at MakerDAO\n* Phase 3: phased audit with industry leading firms:\n  * Quantstamp\n  * Spearbit & Cantina\n* Phase 4: independent audit with Pashov with individual experience of over 50 audits\n* Phase 5: public audit with Code4rena\n* Phase 6: economic and financial risk audit by Chaos Labs\n* Phase 7: upcoming public bug bounty program with Immunefi\n\nCopies of the audit reports can be found [here](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/resources/audits).\n\n## Centralization vectors:\n\nSee [here](https://ethena.notion.site/Ethena-FAQs-3ccc1437e13343f8b74c0d005e4f5128)\n\nValue: The sUSDe/USDC pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for users wishing to avoid the 7-day unstaking period and instead swap sUSDe direct for USDC.\n\nsUSDe on mainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9d39a5de30e57443bff2a8307a4256c8797a3497\n\nUSDC on mainnet: https://etherscan.io/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\n\nsUSDe/USDC pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xb819feef8f0fcdc268afe14162983a69f6bf179e000000000000000000000689\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC#code)\n\n## Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x84f7F5cD2218f31B750E7009Bb6fD34e0b945DaC\n\ngaugeType(string): Ethereum",

Real-time data feeds indicate not only where it delegates collateral, but the various risk profiles between the exchanges.\n\nWith this in mind, it's critically important that Ethena has access to & is constantly consuming real-time price feeds, especially from where it matters most; the exchanges where it holds derivatives positions due to their margin requirements.\n\nEthena consumes real-time pricing information from three primary sources:\n\n* CeFi Exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Okx, Deribit, Bitmex and Bitget.\n* Pyth.\n* Redstone\n\nThis real-time data is used extensively throughout the system to apply business logic, but to also ensure the integrity of all actions.\n\n## Audits:\n\nEthena has undertaken a multi-phased audit program to ensure the highest level of security on the procotol.\n\n* Phase 1: conducted initial audit with Zellic on the v1 of the protocol where no critical or high level vulnerabilities were found.\n* Phase 2: architecture design review and economic risk factor analysis with Spearbit's Kurt Barry former Lead Engineer at MakerDAO\n* Phase 3: phased audit with industry leading firms:\n  * Quantstamp\n  * Spearbit & Cantina\n* Phase 4: independent audit with Pashov with individual experience of over 50 audits\n* Phase 5: public audit with Code4rena\n* Phase 6: economic and financial risk audit by Chaos Labs\n* Phase 7: upcoming public bug bounty program with Immunefi\n\nCopies of the audit reports can be found [here](https://ethena-labs.gitbook.io/ethena-labs/resources/audits).\n\n## Centralization vectors:\n\nSee [here](https://ethena.notion.site/Ethena-FAQs-3ccc1437e13343f8b74c0d005e4f5128)\n\n## Value: \n\nThe sUSDe/USDC and USDe/USDC pools on Balancer are intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the tokens on Arbitrum.\n\n## Specifications\nsUSDe on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x211cc4dd073734da055fbf44a2b4667d5e5fe5d2\n\nUSDe on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x5d3a1ff2b6bab83b63cd9ad0787074081a52ef34\n\nsUSDe/USDC Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x2f0cdf8596be980ef24924ca7bf54e630ca526b2000000000000000000000529\n\nChild chain gauge [0xE9801a0FA08acF9140bA3a347A8c6048fF9Eab7C](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xE9801a0FA08acF9140bA3a347A8c6048fF9Eab7C)\nMainnet root: [0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778)\n\nUSDe/USDC Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x537d8ef9e6e0adfb099cb14aeaf04ebeffaf444c000000000000000000000528\n\nChild chain gauge: [0xc76bCF2221a1Be984FeA73E12429302AfC70feb2](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc76bCF2221a1Be984FeA73E12429302AfC70feb2#readContract)\nMainnet root: [0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c)\n\nsUSDe/USDe Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x02a1e9f29e9a04dbb64114e78cb6cba20c22d73f00000000000000000000052a\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x64B57375a5DD480280cc0513B20e380f1649545c](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x64B57375a5DD480280cc0513B20e380f1649545c)\nMainnet root: [0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493)\n\nsUSDe/sFRAX Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x59743f1812bb85db83e9e4ee061d124aaa64290000000000000000000000052b\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x4b8858a8E42f406B4dC2eCB8D48B5cf0021035c8](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4b8858a8E42f406B4dC2eCB8D48B5cf0021035c8)\nMainnet root: [0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE)\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x6A8B6F0177E273600c6BaE84dA3A9a3c8B29d778`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x41De33d3b227677af277b6c29CB2545195dF508c`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x1c5007AF9907Ac83F6d391B18F28Fb2F5f8c9493`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x4D82D6d68aBfC6B2C9A9fEd775cF24Dbf8b014bE`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

    "summary": "The proposal seeks to enable the gauge for the sUSDe/wstETH pool on Ethereum with uncapped emissions, aiming to facilitate trading between staked ETH and USD assets and enhance yield opportunities. The voting timeline and analytics strongly support the 'Yes' option, and forum sentiment, while mixed with some negativity, largely remains neutral. Historical similar proposals also supported gauge enabling with positive outcomes.",
    "key_arguments_for": [
      "This pool represents the largest onchain staked assets with good yield generation potential even in stable price conditions.",
      "Enabling the gauge simplifies trading between staked ETH and USD without complex unstaking, likely increasing trading activity.",
      "Similar past proposals enabling gauges have been successful and led to positive engagement.",
      "Voting timeline shows strong and stable early support with no competing vote alternatives gaining traction."
    ],
    "key_arguments_against": [
      "Some concerns about centralization vectors as Ethena and Lido have centralized elements.",
      "A negative sentiment comment pointed to potential risks of centralized price feeds and market volatility.",
      "No explicit voting incentives or direction were clarified for this pool in forum discussions."
