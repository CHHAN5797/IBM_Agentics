        "body": "## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-10-08\n\n----------\n\n## Summary\nThe proposal aims to onboard Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin to the Aave v3 protocol Main Market on Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\nRLUSD, a new stablecoin offered by Ripple, is expected to receive NYDFS regulatory approval in the coming weeks and launch on Ethereum soon thereafter. \n\nRipple, a trusted entity in the cryptocurrency industry, introduces RLUSD with a unique value proposition focused on cross-border payments through its global payment network. RLUSD intends to bridge TradFi with DeFi use cases, starting with its flagship payments products serving customers in over 70 markets. They aim to establish RLUSD as the de facto stablecoin for lending/borrowing, DeFi, repo, Treasury functions, payments, etc., all within the highest levels of compliance.\n\nOnboarding Ripple's RLUSD extends Aave Protocol's diverse stablecoin offerings to its users. RLUSD users on Aave Protocol may potentially benefit from future rewards programs. This introduction is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nAligning with Aave DAO’s commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand assets, onboarding RLUSD will enable users to leverage Ripple’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. The initial slow launch of RLUSD is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and attract more mainstream users, contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n## Specification- **Ticker**: RLUSD  \n- Contract addresses will be added during the ARFC stage once RLUSD is fully launched.  - Risk parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers as soon as possible, and the ARFC will be updated with that feedback\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Ripple and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, escalate the proposal to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "Author: ACI\nDate: 2024-10-23\nSimple Summary:\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard SCR, the native token of Scroll, on the Aave V3 Scroll Instance. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow SCR, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Scroll token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background:\nScroll is an Ethereum Layer 2 chain which already has an Aave instance deployment and SCR is the governance token for the Scroll L2. By onboarding SCR to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding SCR’s liquidity.\n\nBenefits of listing this token:\n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their SCR to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow SCR against other collateral allowing them to participate in Scroll governance.\n\nMarket Impact:\n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding SCR except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding SCR as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new L2 ecosystem.\n\nChain to be deployed/listed:\n\nScroll.\n\nProof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage. SCR will be included in future incentives programs.\n\nUseful Links:\nScroll website 1\nScroll docs\nDisclaimer:\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Scroll and did not receive compensation for creation of this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of SCR.\n\nNext Steps:\nIf consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\nCopyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

Benefits of listing: \nslisBNB is the native yield bearing and liquid staking token for BNB, built by Lista DAO. slisBNB appreciates against BNB in line with BNB’s staking APR, allowing users have the freedom to earn additional yields on different DeFi platforms while earning staking rewards passively.\n\nslisBNB is the largest BNB LST in terms of TVL (~$225M) and holders (350,262), listing slisBNB can bring both Aave and Lista communities the opportunities to enjoy the passive yield of supplying slisBNB on Aave as well as the Lista token airdrop. \n\n2. Chain to be deployed: BNB Chain\n3. Proof of Liquidity: Lista DAO is open to provide $2500 weekly incentives, last for 8 weeks to bootstrap the liquidity of slisBNB on Aave. \n4. Useful links: https://lista.org/\n\n\n**Disclaimer**\nThis proposal is powered by core contributor of ListaDAO.\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lista DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n**Next Steps**\n1.If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2.If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3.Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4.If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks. Aave stands to gain significantly as a primary partner in this expansion, following the successful playbook of cbBTC, which quickly scaled through similar collaborative efforts.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: 0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364\n\nChainlink oracle: upcoming\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: Bitcoin Reserve Address | FBTC\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: FBTC proof of assets dashboard\n\nGitHub: GitHub - fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: fbtc-contract/audits at main · fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract · GitHub\n\nTwitter: x.com\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\nDisclosure\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublish a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
