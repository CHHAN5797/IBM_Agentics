Initially, BIP-525 proposed a part-time 'trial period' for lipman's involvement, but lipman quickly assimilated into the team, assuming a full-time role almost immediately and driving impact for the DAO. Additionally, BIP-525 had anticipated json's phased exit from the Balancer BDSP in Q2, yet it is evident that json contribution in Q2 will continue to add value on a part-time basis.\n\nDuring Q1, the primary goals for the BDSP included shifting BD responsibilities from json to lipman and integrating lipman into the Balancer ecosystem, encompassing the DAO team and external partner network. Simultaneously, the BDSP was tasked with assessing potential opportunities for chain expansion and pursuing applicable grants. These initial objectives were achieved, and the BDSP targeted much of its focus to protocol expansion and fostering partnerships quickly in the early stages of Q1. This proactive shift not only enhanced the BDSP's productivity in Q1 but also positioned Balancer for a highly productive quarter in Q2.\n\nA BDSP update as of mid February can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/business-development-sp-january-2024-update/5583). Other highlights in Q1 include (in no particular order):\n\n* The [LRT tripool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a) reached $120m in TVL\n* Evaluating and negotiating deals with multiple L2s for Balancer expansion: Metis, Scroll, Monad, BNB, Linea, X1, Mode, Injective, Sei, BoB, and more.\n* Cultivating strong relationships with key LRT partners such as Renzo, Etherfi, Swell, Kelp, Vector Reserve, and others. These relationships are evident from TVL, ve8020 launches, and by partners telling us they only want to work with Balancer on new chains.\n* Developing relationships with key industry players. A few examples include the defi leadership team at Base, Aave for GHO liquidity on Balancer, Trident/Paypal/Paxos for pyUSD, Paradigm, and many others\n* Evaluating CCIP with Chainlink and the Maxis for easier partner onboarding\n* Kicking off a multi-functional project team to revamp the partner onboarding process with a new UI and self-service features\n* Securing [100% of Balancer’s vlAura](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x6b7042ca6b93fea257320f21fc4934ac27544dc4d07738761561c95db3bdeb8a) for the BDSP’s discretionary use.\n* Launching a [ve8020 pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x0f9fdc4d883f6d85b68ce1b8b96aa706a3538e5b000200000000000000000675) with Vector Reserve\n* Launching LRTs on new chains via Balancer\n* Outreach and exploration of opportunities with projects across an array of functions. Some of the many examples include (in no particular order):\n  * BoB (bitcoin L2)\n  * Boost\n  * Conduit.xyz\n  * Ethena\n  * Eclipse\n  * Peapod Finance\n  * Prisma\n  * Inverse Finance\n  * Magpie (LRT)\n  * AlphaGrowth\n  * pyUSD\n  * EstateX\n  * Restake Finance\n  * Liquid Collective\n  * Shadow\n  * Stakestone\n  * Milkyway\n  * Puffer\n  * And more\n\n### Key Objectives for Q2-2024\n\nLead Contributor: lipman\n\nSupport Contributor: json\n\n* Initiate the launch of new chains:\n  * Finalize the selection of chains for Balancer's launch.\n  * Conclude agreements with the chosen chains, including incentive structures, seeding liquidity, co-marketing, etc.\n  * Collaborate with engineering, Maxis, and marketing teams for the deployment on these new chains.\n  * Establish a comprehensive partnership network and ecosystem on the new chains, encompassing liquidity providers, yield-bearing assets, lending protocols, etc.\n  * Complete grant applications and administrative tasks necessary to secure incentives and other advantages from the new chains.\n* Enhance presence on existing chains:\n  * Develop, coordinate, and execute growth initiatives on Layer 2 solutions for existing chains, focusing on Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base networks.\n* Expand the yield-bearing thesis initiative.\n  * Launch new pools for LSTs and LRTs on mainnet.\n  * Introduce new pools for yield-bearing stablecoins.\n  * Bring LST/LRT partners to new chains where Balancer is deployed\n* Extend the ve8020 governance initiative.\n  * Explore ve8020 collaborations with pre-token projects, such as LRT projects.\n  * Promote ve8020 to projects with existing tokens.\n* Manage the application, monitoring, and execution of the Optimism grant program.\n* Streamline partner onboarding:\n  * Find ways to reduce friction in partner onboarding processes.\n  * Iterate on the notion pack, created by Marketing, to highlight the benefits of Balancer and guide new partners through the onboarding process.\n  * Collaborate with a small project team, including design, marketing, and Maxis, to rethink the partner onboarding process, potentially introducing a self-service UI.\n  * Evaluate the CCIP with Chainlink and implement it if necessary to streamline the rate provider onboarding process.\n* Prepare for v3 launch and seek partnerships:\n  * Seek integrations and partnerships in anticipation of the v3 launch.\n  * Collaborate with the Maxis to identify innovative use cases for exploration.\n  * Reach out to projects to present the v3 opportunity and establish partnerships ahead of the launch.\n* Continue ad hoc outreach to projects, exploring new partnerships and opportunities.\n\nPledge to abide by the [DAO’s Code of Conduct](https://fifth-broom-2e6.notion.site/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88): YES\n\nPledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://fifth-broom-2e6.notion.site/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1): YES\n\nAdhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards: YES\n\nLength of Engagement & Budget: 3 months (April 2024 - June 2024)\n\nThe biggest adjustment in the BDSP funding proposal is transitioning lipman from a part-time ‘trial basis’ status due to the limited budget originally allocated for Q1 before lipman was involved [[BIP-433](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xbdd578a51415c10d7d9f0fd3c80758edfa4a56b6720247bc9f1d33ec2b8bc0c3)] to a regular contributor in Q2 with FTE comp. Lipman’s compensation will include a combination of liquid tokens (USDC) and locked BAL to provide upside for the impact the BDSP is making on growth of the protocol. Json will continue to contribute on a limited, part-time basis including supporting lipman as needed.\n\n* Lipman =\n  * $12,500 USDC per month ($37,500 total for the quarter)\n  * 2,114 locked BAL per month (6,342 BAL for the quarter)\n    * ~$10,000 in USD value as of the 30 day TWAP $BAL price of $4.73 as of Mar 11, 2024\n* Json = $2,000 USDC per month ($6k total for the quarter)\n\nImpact on the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold ~4.2M BAL. Funding the BDSP for Q2 2024 would cost around 0.15% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~0.60% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.78M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 0.25% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~1.00%.\n\n## Retro Funding of Business Development of Q1 2024\n\nAs previously mentioned, the initial Q1 budget of $20k was established before lipman's involvement, with the intention of accommodating a part-time contributor. However, lipman surpassed this expectation and also significantly contributed to the quarter as an active, full-time participant. Lipman received $15k of the $20k budget during Q1 with json receiving the remaining $5k.\n\nIn light of Lipman's increased involvement and impact during Q1, a request is being made for an additional $17.5k in USDC. This amount, in addition to the $15k provided and a $5k bonus from the Q1 Maxi discretionary budget, is equivalent to the monthly USDC amount being requested for Q2 ($12.5k/mo).\n\n### Technical Specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer passing the BDSP Safe 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a as recipient and amount 61000 USDC as 61000000000.\n\nTthe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with BAL 0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D by writing transfer passing the BDSP Safe 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a as recipient and amount 6342 as 6342000000000000000000.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1072\n\n# Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider Proposal Q3 2024\n\n## TL;DR\n\n** Updated with revised compensation.**\n\nWith V3 set for imminent public code release, the grants program requests funding to target new V3 integrations, create a hook bounty program and partner with ecosystems to build more on Balancer with the new and improved DX. This quarter’s focus will be to find and fund projects launching on Balancer V3 to help boost wide adoption.\n\nWith this launch pending and a long history of performance, the committee requests funding for 3 months to continue to focus on funding in line with the findings in the [historical assessment report](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458). \n\nMain points:\n\n* Funding duration 3 months from July 1st to September 30th, 2024.\n* Funding for new grantees - 75k BAL\n* Grants lead compensation reduced by $3k, committee members to contribute pro bono\n* Funding categories identified in 2023 Q4 Program Recap\n* Attract more projects to build on V3 and port over pools from V2\n* Run V3 hook bounty program\n* Partner with supported chains for co-funding and more visibility\n\nWith unspent BAL in the treasury and the recovery of funds from stale grants, funding is requested to top up the treasury (currently 41,473 BAL uncommitted) to:\n\n1. 75,000 BAL for new grantees (**33,527 BAL top up**)\n2. 15,000 USDC for committee/support (**6,900 USDC top up**)\n\nAs always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community on how to better develop the Balancer grants program.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Grants\n\n**Leader(s):** Burns, with committee members John Grant, Mike B, Steve0xp and Zen Dragon.\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 (or link to your own):** Yes\n\n**Pledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines:** Yes\n\nIn accordance with the Balancer DAO [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1) and uphold those [proposed here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808). This will include the Grant’s Committee:\n\n* Developing a monthly report detailing key objective progress which is posted to the Balancer Forum and Medium\n* Attending and presenting during the Baller weekly meeting (mandatory attendance by at least 1 representative)\n\nThe grants committee will undertake compliance checks and facilitate agreements between grantees and OpCo for funding amounts $20k and above.\n\n#### Domain of Operation\n\nAfter 12 waves of funding and a recap over the last quarter, this proposal seeks to continue the grants program as per [BIP-573](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-573-fund-balancer-grants-for-q2-2024/5650) to support the release of Balancer’s V3. The program will continue to offer up to $100K USD in BAL tokens per grant supporting the Balancer Protocol's mission to become a leading DeFi liquidity source, catering to both short-term and one-off projects, as an alternative to the Foundation SP model's focus on long-term and higher-cost engagements.\n\nThe Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below.\n\nFollowing on from the quarter of reflections and [subsequent report and recommendations](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458), the grants program will be focused on:\n\n1. Continue to mentor and deliver with existing grantees\n\nThe program currently has 5 live grantees building assorted integrations, novel use cases for Balancer pools and educational resources. The committee has assisted projects to complete their milestones and intervened where the project has gone stale to recover funds for future grants. These projects total ~72k BAL of committed funds yet to be paid for outstanding milestones. These can be reviewed on our [Finalized and Live Grants Notion Page.](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9)\n\nDeliverables: On-going support/management, monthly reports, coordination between Balancer entities.\n\n2. Fund projects dedicated to increasing adoption of Balancer V3\n\nWith Balancer V3 launching in Q4 2024, grants will play a significant role in incentivising projects to:\n\n* Integrate Balancer V3.\n* Create educational content, tooling and docs to lower barriers to entry for teams building on V3\n* Create new use cases with Balancer custom pools\n* Bounties for highly active community members providing dev support, incentivising integrations for analytics sites etc\n\nDeliverables: Live Grant assessment sheet, monthly reports, weekly meetings\n\n3. Funding Initiatives\n\nTo expand the Balancer ecosystem we will be running the following specific initiatives:\n\n* Run a hook bounty program\n\nThe program’s goal is to encourage experimentation and explore the bounds of what hook functionality can bring to Balancer pools through rapid development. These will be in the form of small awards for hook builders or audits for high quality and valuable contracts.\n\n* Co-funding through agreements with supported chains\n\nWith new launches on chains such as Mode and existing chains who are seeking to expand development such as Polygon zkEVM, the committee has been in discussions with grant programs that are excited to jointly support projects building on Balancer and their ecosystem.\n\nThe two avenues that we will be taking are\n\n1. General applications for funding through programs such as OP to expand our treasury\n2. Project specific proposals through programs such as Polygon or Avalanche\n\n4. Funding categories\n\nAcross these avenues of focus, categories to direct funding are:\n\n|Category|Why / Why not|\n| --- | --- |\n|Analytics|Continuously improving analytics and encouraging existing projects to include Balancer drives volume to the protocol. Clear value.|\n|Custom Pool Types|Custom pool types have the highest potential value to Balancer but are risky. These projects create new use cases and showcase Balancer technology.|\n|Education / Tooling|Very important to make Balancer more user/dev friendly and drive adoption of building and investing in the platform.|\n|Research|Research has been generally avoided after early failed proposals. Recommendation is to revisit funding research as optimizations or new use cases may prove valuable. Risky with low likelihood of payout but high potential payout.|\n|Swap Aggregators|Swap aggregators create more revenue streams. Strategic grants may be considered.|\n|Wrappers / Infrastructure|Can lower barriers to entry for other projects looking to integrate with Balancer and provide additional revenue streams|\n|Yield Aggregators*|Only with a direct value calculation. There are generally sufficient incentives for yield aggregators. With no yield bearing assets, this is not worth funding.\n\nIf the aggregator has the potential to bring high volume and TVL of yield bearing assets, then a value calculation can be made.|\n\n#### Grants Committee\n\nThe Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. The committee remains an equal democracy with no person having a greater authority on what is approved or not. We rely on individuals’ expertise in different areas to help make informed decisions.\n\nBurns - Committee Coordination Lead\n\nJohn Grant - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nMikeB - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nSteve - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nZen Dragon- Committee Member/Mentor\n\nThe committee has the ability to onboard/offboard members as individual circumstances change throughout the quarter between funding proposals. Given the authority to approve and distribute grant funding, the committee can also self manage members within the approved budget.\n\nThe Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Ecosystem SPs and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.\n\nBy having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.\n\n#### Previous Performance\n\nAs a committee we have shown ourselves as:\n\n* Diligent assessors of grant applications with intimate understanding of the DAO and protocol.\n\n* Trusted to find and manage grantees building on core Balancer code alongside Balancer Labs. With one grantee being on-boarded to Balancer Labs.\n* Fairly recover funds from stale grantees when no longer relevant saving ~30k BAL to date\n* Prudent with spending to maintain the grants treasury and limit BAL expenditure\n* Supporting grantees to completion by connecting with the resources required\n\nQ2 Recaps: [April Monthly Report](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-april-2024-update/5739) and [May Monthly Report](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/grants-monthly-update-for-may-2024/5791)\n\nTotal application submissions and approvals:\n\n \n![grants1.png](ipfs://bafkreidfdsrjoxchotf2fyphevi5nbo45jgvoe6r2hzsfuc3lx5ybzk4li)\n    \n\n#### Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown\n\nThis budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants SP for the period July 1st to Sept 30th, 2024. Unallocated resources will be kept to offset the next budget request if successful.\n\nCommittee Lead - $5,000 USD paid in USDC - mentor and provide support/coordination for all grantee teams, administration of grants docs, RFP development, prepare and present monthly reports, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .\n\nCommittee members - pro bono as a part of other DAO SP roles\n\n|Expense|Amount in BAL/USD|Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Q3 Grants|75,000 BAL|To be rewarded to grantees based on milestones following the full Grants review process. For sub $5k USD contributions a light review process will be utilized. Includes buffer for current approved grants in $USD to be paid in BAL.|\n|1 Grants lead|$5k x 3 months = $15k USDC|The Grants Lead Role takes ownership of the establishment and operations of the Balancer Grant processes. The lead is responsible for coordinating with Committee Members, scheduling and hosting meetings, carrying out KYC/compliance due diligence, maintaining Medium and Notion pages and leading the post grants report.|\n|Other Program Expenses|500 BAL|Any other program expenses that may be required for the smooth execution of the grants program. This may include (but is not limited to) to design, analytics, media, PR, research, legal, gas fees or any other specialized functions outside the skillset of the committee|\n|Uncommitted Treasury|41,472 BAL & 8,100 USDC|\n|**Total request for Q3**|**33,527 BAL & 6,900 USDC**|\n\n#### Funds to Transfer: 33,527 BAL & 6,900 USDC\n\nThe Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 5) will continue to operate with the remaining funds in the Grants treasury (0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597) carried over and approved to be delegated to the grantees.\n\nImpact on the Treasury: The Treasury currently holds ~3.95M BAL. Funding Balancer Grants for Q3 is at a cost of 1.90% of the treasury’s BAL holdings (this is assuming all 75k BAL is spent on grantees), which annualizes to ~7.59%. The Treasury currently holds ~5.34M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost ~0.28% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~1.1%.\n\nAll transactions will be recorded in a Sheet maintained by the committee and on chain.\n\n#### ETH Address to Receive Funds\n\nGrants Treasury - 0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597\n\nCurrent Treasury Balance ~ 82,187BAL + 18,500 USDC\n\nCommitted ~ 40,714 BAL + 10,400 USDC (@$3.50 USD/BAL)\n\nUncommitted treasury ~41, 472 BAL + 8,1000 USDC\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer passing the Grants SP Safe 0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597 as recipient and amount 6,900 USDC as 6900000000.\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with BAL 0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D by writing transfer passing the Grants SP Safe 0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597 as recipient and amount 33,527 as 33527000000000000000000.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1069\n\n## Introduction\n\n![ethMaxi.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicvsvxykkf7mhrbht4idfm5c2zs2u376rrjhe725lf4iidcsu64oy)\n\nThe Maxis have firmly established themselves as the on-chain operators for the Balancer DAO. By evolving into a DevOps powerhouse with a strong focus on automation, we are strategically positioned to meet the challenges of Balancer's ambitious expansion plans.\n\nAs Balancer gears up for a transformative phase, with innovative products slated for release in Q3 and Q4 2024, the Maxis are ready to lead the charge. Exciting developments on the horizon include the groundbreaking CoWAMM technology and the highly anticipated v3 installment of Balancer tech. Our team is dedicated to ensuring a seamless integration experience for partners and uninterrupted operations of the protocol.\n\nTo achieve this, we will lay a robust foundation for all on-chain operations needed for these new products while maintaining and optimizing the current infrastructure with utmost efficiency.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nOrganizing initiatives into work packages has significantly enhanced our ability to focus on specific operational domains with clear deliverables. Moving forward, we will concentrate our efforts on two key work packages that promise high-value outcomes for the DAO.\n\n### Initiative 1: On-Chain DevOps Hub\n\n**Co-Leads: Xeonus & Tritium**\n\n**Team: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)**\n\n#### Summary\n\nWith our increased development capacity, we have successfully undertaken significant initiatives and expanded our responsibilities. This includes operating and migrating the OpenZeppelin infrastructure to OZ v2, optimizing the codebase, and reducing gas costs. Additionally, we have completed the Secondary Token Reward injector infrastructure, set to go operational in Q3.\n\nOur main focus moving forward includes enhancing fee processing infrastructure, ensuring scalability with upcoming product launches, and extending our operations to new chains. Our objectives reflect these priorities:\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1.

UI Beta Testing and Support\n\n**Objectives for Growth Initiatives**\n\nPartner Onboarding Experience\n\n*  Provide an in-depth and comprehensive partner onboarding documentation for both Balancer v2 and Balancer v3 tech\n* Provide guides and content for the official documentation on how to integrate with Balancer as a partner\n* Advise partners on liquidity provisioning and assist in onboarding and any on-chain executions necessary.\n3. Onboard new liquidity on new chain deployments\n4. Assist in establishing new product launches such as the potential CoWAMM product.\n\nFinally, the Maxis team is committed to ensuring efficient on-chain operations for the Balancer DAO. We manage governance-related change control processes, oversee DevOps and multisig automation, and provide infrastructure guidance. Our responsibilities include automating on-chain tasks with OZ Defender and Chainlink Automation, developing smart contracts and tooling, supporting technical best practices, processing bi-weekly fees, and managing grant programs and incentive distributions. These efforts ensure smooth and reliable operations within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview:** Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers:** Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards**: YES\n\n### Domains of Operation\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\nKey Objectives per Operational Discipline:\n\n**1.

We will continue operating in a similar manner as in Q2, anticipating increased demand for automation work and partner support due to new product launches.\n\nOur spending will be closely monitored, with clear insights provided in our monthly reports, as demonstrated in Q2 2024. We believe this setup will significantly aid Balancer DAO in achieving its goals of becoming the hub for LRT, LST, and LRT liquidity.\n\nOverall, people costs in USDC terms will remain consistent with [previous quarters](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-568-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2024/5625). The Maxis will receive part of their compensation in locked BAL, vesting over one year. With an average of 56% of compensation taken as locked BAL, this demonstrates our strong commitment and alignment with the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Length of engagement: 3 months**\n**Budget: 172’500 USDC and 14’464 BAL**\n\n### Cost Breakdown\n\n|Position|Cost per month|\n| --- | --- |\n|People Cost (USDC), 4.7 FTE|46’500 USDC|\n|People Cost, 4.7 FTE (BAL, with 1.25 multiplier) - Locked for 1 year|4’821 BAL|\n|Discretionary Budget to fund freelancers (2 FTE) and infrastructure cost (USDC)|20’000 USDC|\n\nFor Q3 the Maxis have decreased the ask for locked BAL resulting in a decrease of ask in the budget by 24'000 USD while also saving 27'000 USDC in Q2 from the discretionary budget which rolls over to Q3. This results in total savings of 51’000 USD compared to Q2.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325\n\n#### Impact on the Treasury\n\n**The Treasury wallets currently hold ~3.95M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 2024 would cost around 0.37% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.46% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.43M in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3.18% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to ~12.7%.**\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount 172’500 USDC as `172500000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount 14’464 as `14464000000000000000000`.",

        "body": "## PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/717\n\n## Background\n\nThe intent of this proposal is to gain alignment with the Balancer DAO on the creation and funding of the Business Development Service Provider (‘BDSP’). The BDSP will track and facilitate ongoing and future growth for the Balancer ecosystem. Furthermore, the proposal presents the responsibilities for the future BD contributor who will represent Balancer in the new year, 2024. Lastly, the proposal is a request from the DAO for payment from the approved Q4 BD budget to contributors who have provided continuous efforts toward the growth of Balancer.\n\n### Creation of the BDSP\n\nHistorically, Balancer DAO’s resources have been split amongst many different work streams such as governance, gauge creation, legal, marketing, etc.. Since the beginning of 2023, other protocols have executed on the growth of the ecosystem by collaborating, developing, and launching on top of Balancer’s technology layers. Whilst the development has been quite healthy, despite an otherwise turbulent and unforgiving market, there still remains a dire need for more growth-focused work. Current DAO service providers simply do not have the capacity nor the resources needed to facilitate business development specific workstreams with adequate focus.\n\nThe following contributor description is intended to elucidate the purpose of the business development role, detail the expectations of the contributor, and outline their responsibilities. If deemed as necessary and aligned on by the community and DAO, the new contributor would help to facilitate growth for Balancer beginning in Q1 of 2024. It is desirable for the DAO to provide input to the role so as to ensure a strong first quarter of 2024.\n\n### BD Contributor Description\n\nIn this role, the contributor will collaborate closely with the Balancer DAO, Balancer Maxis, Aura contributors, and a vibrant community of skilled professionals, to execute on ecosystem-critical growth strategies. As a key player in the ecosystem, the BD contributor will play a pivotal role in fostering partnerships, driving adoption, and expanding Balancer's presence in the rapidly evolving DeFi space.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n1. Partnership Development:\n    - Maintain and cultivate current strategic partnerships with key players in the broader DeFi space.\n    - Collaborate on, provide input to, and execute on a network-specific growth strategy during the duration of 2024.\n    - Explore new external, high-quality partnerships within the growing DeFi ecosystems.\n    - Collaborate with Aura and in-network partner protocol’s contributors to maintain current and grow future market share of DeFi composability within key networks (e.g. Arbitrum, Base, OP, etc.)\n    - Ideation, collaboration on the creation, and monitoring of KPI-tracking Dune dashboards.\n\n2. Protocol Expansion:\n\n    - Collaborate with key network partners of the ideation and execution of growth strategies.\n    - Define framework for measuring ROI of layer 2 deployments.\n    - Collaborate with ecosystem partners on future layer 2 deployments.\n    - Collaborate with marketing contributors on launch campaigns for networks\n\n3. Ecosystem Engagement:\n\n    - Engage with the broader blockchain and DeFi communities to promote awareness of Balancer and its unique value proposition.\n    - If deemed as a beneficial opportunity, represent Balancer DAO at conferences, meetups, and industry events.\n    - Track KPIs for critical ecosystems to ensure adequate ROI of dApp deployment.\n\n4. Market Analysis:\n\n    - Stay informed about market trends, competitor activities, and regulatory developments to inform business strategies.\n    - Provide quarterly reports and insights to the DAO regarding the competitive landscape and potential opportunities.\n\nA current ecosystem contributor (json) that focuses on business development will help the new BD individual (lipman) during the first quarter, completing a handover period. The expectation is that the new individual will take over full responsibility starting the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe new contributor (lipman) will be responsible for BD on a part-time basis during a ‘trial period’ which will give the DAO a low-cost opportunity to vet the contributor’s impact and determine how the contributor’s role, and the Service Provider at large, should be expanded in Q2 and beyond. Ultimately, the contributor will undergo an iterative process with other service providers to ensure that tangible value is provided to both the DAO and the ecosystem.\n\n## Service Provider Name: Business Development\n\n**Contributors: json, lipman**\n\nPledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct: Yes\n\nPledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines: Yes\n\n### Key Objectives for Q1-2024\n\n* Transition Balancer related BD activity from json to lipman\n* Onboarding of lipman to broader Balancer ecosystem\n  * Develop general understanding of internal Balancer operations + processes for BD support\n  * Develop understanding of Maxi priorities, their ideas for growth, and include within a prioritized list of initiatives to pursue in Q1.\n  * Meet with existing, key Balancer partners to get introduced, offer support, uncover needs, etc.\n  * Develop grasp of V3 and its implications for growth to position BD ahead of Q2 launch\n* Apply for new grant programs and monitor current grant programs\n  * Reapply for Optimism grant\n  * Pursue grants for Gnosis, Avalanche, Polygon zkEVM (partners only), Scroll (TBD), Linea (TBD), etc.\n* Create a framework to quantify layer 2 expansion opportunities and collaborate with Balancer DAO developers on the execution of each expansion\n* Develop and maintain relationships with potential new networks (e.g. Scroll, Linea, X1) and current networks (e.g. Arbitrum, Optimism)\n* Perform a competitive landscape review to understand where Balancer sits in comparison to industry peers\n    * Understand gaps via the analysis and work with the Balancer DAO to determine how to close the aforementioned gaps\n* Frame Key Performance Indicators and success targets for 2024\n    * Retrofit or design a dashboard to monitor success of growth for 2024\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget**\n\n3 months. January 2024 - March 2024\n\nCompensation amounts will be funded by the $20k approved for BD activity in Q1 2024 [BIP-433](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xbdd578a51415c10d7d9f0fd3c80758edfa4a56b6720247bc9f1d33ec2b8bc0c3).\n\n* lipman: Max budget of 5,000 USDC per month. Given this is a part-time role, lipman’s availability and need may fluctuate week-to-week. A quarterly recap of activities will be provided.\n* json: Budget of 5,000 USDC for Q1\n\nFunds to Transfer: 20,000 USDC + 0.3 ETH\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:**\n\n0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a, the BD Service Provider multisig, which will include json, lipman, and MikeB as signers.\n\nJson wallet: 0xE2A4DE267cdD4fF5ED9Ba13552F5c624b12db9b2\n\nLipman wallet: 0x72658e9A5c55371A5e80559B8E07AbC14F212120\n\nMikeB wallet: 0xF01Cc7154e255D20489E091a5aEA10Bc136696a8\n\n## Retro Funding of Business Development of Q4 2023\n\nBalancer’s primary aggregator, Aura Finance, has allocated continuous resources toward the growth of the Balancer ecosystem spanning everything from grants to marketing to protocol integrations. Naturally, the aggregator layer has helped to amplify the benefits of Balancer’s vote escrow tokenomics given the function of the protocol. However, Aura Finance contributors continued to provide tangible value not only to the DAO via revenue streams but also to the ecosystem as a whole. A portion of this proposal aims to help compensate for the efforts that supported Balancer’s growth throughout 2023.\n\n**Non-Exhaustive List of Contributions:**\n\n* Application, monitoring, and execution of the Optimism grant program.\n  * [Progress report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QvmZ0CldL1Dlpk56Tpv8dCkXOuMxFQIAbRj5pj5lQrE/edit?usp=sharing) on the Optimism grant program\n  * [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/scoffie/aura-gauges-op-incentives) for tracking Optimism grant program\n* Development, coordination, and continued execution of Layer 2 growth initiatives.\n  * Networks: Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Polygon zkEVM, Gnosis, and Base.\n  * Creation of 2024 growth strategies for each of the above-mentioned networks.\n* Outreach and execution of protocol integrations\n  * Protocols: Sentiment, VMEX, Timeswap, Gyrsocope, JonesDAO, Extra Fi, BitGet Wallet, Notional, Beefy, Radiant, etc\n* Outreach for ve8020 program\n  * Protocols: Mimo, VMEX, Radiant, Manifold etc\n* Exposure from DeFi Industry Leaders\n  * Aave DAO, Swell, DeFi Collective, Paraswap, etc\n* Growth of key ecosystem assets (i.e. LSTs)\n  * LST outreach: mevETH, ether.fi, Stakewise, Origin, etc.\n  * Future-facing high-revenue assets for Balancer (undisclosed)\n\nThe Balancer DAO [approved a budget for business development and growth](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-433-maxi-funding-proposal-q4-2023/5191) for Q4 of 2023. This proposal asks for the payout of 25% (5k USD) of the total budget for the quarter. The payout will be made to an Aura Finance contributor, json.\n\nWhile this proposal provides a general overview of the work that has been done in Q4 2023 it is highly encouraged that the DAO and community provide feedback on what they would like to see as a requirement for business and development growth contributors moving forward. Transparency and accountability will help to ensure that the protocol is progressing in the right direction while maximizing the efficiency of its runway.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48` by writing `transfer` passing json’s wallet, `0xE2A4DE267cdD4fF5ED9Ba13552F5c624b12db9b2`, as recipient and amount `5000` USDC as 5000000000.\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will send 20,000 USDC and 0.3 ETH to the BD Service Provider multisig 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a",
