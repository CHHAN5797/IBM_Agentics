        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Aave Chan Initiative 6-Month Budget Proposal",
        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is a delegate platform dedicated to actively participating in Aave governance and contributing to the protocol's success. As the Aave ecosystem matures, it is essential to have diverse and independent delegate platforms to drive the protocol forward.\n\nTo continue our efforts and effectively serve the Aave community, we are seeking a 6-month budget allocation. This budget will support our ongoing initiatives and enable us to expand our team and resources for maximum impact.\n\n## **ACI's current & future areas of focus**\n\n1. **Governance and AIP Development**\n    - Active participation in Aave governance discussions & votes\n    - Developing and submitting snapshot votes & AIPs\n    - Engaging with the community on forum discussions\n    - Collaborating with other delegates and stakeholders\n2. **Treasury Efficiency and Management**\n    - Collaborate with DAO service contributors, such as Llama, to enhance Aave DAO treasury management.\n    - Support initiatives and actively participate in efforts to improve treasury efficiency, led by Llama and other contributors.\n    - Drive the adoption of strategic investments, diversification, and risk mitigation in treasury allocation.\n    - Establish a cost-conscious culture and ensure responsible spending from the treasury for the benefit of the Aave protocol and its users.\n3. **Protocol and Ecosystem Development**\n    - Support the onboarding of new stablecoins, strategic assets, and LSDs\n    - Explore synergies with other DeFi platforms (e.g., Curve, Balancer, Arrakis)\n    - Promote the use of yield-bearing assets and LP tokens as collateral\n    - Participate in discussions around GHO and Safety Module improvements and advocate for “Real Yield” revenue for the Safety module paid in GHO\n    - Support the expansion of Aave markets in “new Frontiers” networks\n4. **Research and Analysis**\n    - Conduct in-depth research on DeFi trends and developments\n    - Provide insights and recommendations to the Aave community\n    - Analyze the performance and impact of Aave governance decisions\n    - Assess new risk mitigation strategies and techniques\n5. **Team Expansion and Operations**\n    - Grow the ACI team to support the Aave ecosystem better\n    - Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure\n    - Foster a collaborative environment for continuous learning and improvement\n    - Start a “Meta-Governance” focus for ACI. While the ACI can be considered “Aave-Maximalist,” there’s a lot of potential for having an active presence in other DeFi DAOs and representing Aave-DAO interest there, compared to other “professional” delegates, the laser-focus of ACI on Aave DAO interest will allow to have a voice focused on Aave synergies with other actors of the ecosystem.\n6. **Independence & Transparency**\n    - While the ACI grew to become the largest Aave DAO delegate platform, we are proud that our voting power originates from hundreds of individuals from the community that decided to trust the ACI with their voting and proposal power.\n   - To the best of our knowledge, the ACI voting & proposal power is not linked to any specific entity, Investment firm, or third-party protocol, allowing the ACI to remain 100% independent & focus on the benefit of the Aave protocol.\n   - The ACI firmly declined any form of third-party compensation for creating proposals & publishing AIPs as it would be against our independence ethos. The ACI works for the Aave DAO solely & uniquely.\n   - The ACI created & self-imposed mandatory disclosure on every proposal and will continue to support a transparency culture within the Aave DAO.\n\n## **Previous Work**\n\nHere are some notable achievements and contributions made by the Aave Chan Initiative:\n\n- **Governance Coordination**: The ACI actively supported governance participation & coordination; since the Launch of the ACI, exactly **ZERO** AIPs have failed to meet a 320k AAVE vote participation, while it was unfortunately common in 2022.\n- **AIPs**: The ACI presented and created numerous AIPs that have successfully been implemented to improve the Aave protocol. Since the Launch of the ACI, The AAVE DAO is now the most Active major DeFI DAO in the ecosystem. Q1 2023 was the most active quarter in terms of governance ever for Aave.\n    \n- **Governance improvement**: The ACI is actively involved in improving governance efficiency by providing the community with new frameworks, templates, fast-tracks & shortcuts to make Aave as efficient as possible.\n- **Delegators & contributor coordination:** The ACI actively worked with and supported other DAO delegates, contributors, community members & third-party actors by providing feedback on their proposals, technical support when needed, and doing numerous “co-authorship” synergies with other DAO actors.\n\n## **Requested Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of $250,000 for 6 months period to support our initiatives, team expansion, and operations. This budget will help us:\n\n- Sustainably continue our current work\n- Cover operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure required to support our work\n- Grow the ACI team, allowing us to better serve the Aave community and expand our areas of focus. While the “One-Man Army” meme is fun, the current workload and ambitions for the future are not compatible with a single-person operation\n- Establish an active presence in other DeFi DAOs, representing Aave-DAO interests and exploring synergies with other actors in the ecosystem\n\nBy securing this budget, the Aave Chan Initiative will be in a sustainable position to continue to provide value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the TEMP CHECK is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission detailing the proposal's specifics such as technical implementation of the proposal.\nWe commit to maintaining transparency throughout the process and regularly updating the community on our progress.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal. We appreciate your support and look forward to working together to drive the success of the Aave protocol.",

        "title": "Deploy Aave V3 to Metis Andromeda Mainnet",
        "author": "0x070341aA5Ed571f0FB2c4a5641409B1A46b4961b",
        "body": "Summary\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.\n\nProposal: About Metis\nBorn out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top-notch scalability; built-in on-chain credentials through Nuvo, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling Web3 and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nAndromeda network utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereum’s underlying security. Currently, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitalik’s proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a first-of-its-kind Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollup’s security with plasma’s scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next business verticals.\n\nOur second vertical is Nuvo, a Web3 identity system providing infrastructure to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain credentials: portable and composable credentials earned through on-chain achievements and history. Soulbound tokens will allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren’t previously available for Web3. Nuvo also offers a state-of-the-art cross-chain wallet, enabling account abstraction and several benefits for users. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long-term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 organizations looking to transition into Web3 without facing a substantial UI change.\n\nThird, Koris: tooling and infrastructure for DAOs, and soon, seamless onboarding of Web2 to Web3 through our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework. Koris provides tooling and infrastructure for DAOs to perform their day-to-day operations in a more efficient manner and will allow Web2 organizations to create and tailor DACs to their preference.\n\nWhen combining all these components, Metis Andromeda will create a framework for open, decentralized, and trustless collaboration between individuals, dApps, and Web2 organizations transitioning to Web3. All the functionalities enabled by on-chain credentials, the scalability provided by the base Layer 2, and the tooling provided by Koris’ operational system. The perfect suite for dApps, Web2 platforms, or any builder.\n\nMetisDAO Foundation announced earlier this month its upcoming transition to a Hybrid Rollup, either late 2023, or early 2024. This architecture will combine the EVM Compatibility and fast transaction confirmation of Optimistic Rollups, with the censorship-resistance, security, and fast transaction finality enabled by zero-knowledge proofs. Logically, this will be a huge step to secure the Decentralized Finance applications of the network, and provide a very robust base layer for the Web3 Economy.\n\nCommitted to supporting our ecosystem builders and seeing them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can fund projects in 3 main ways:\nBuilder Mining Rewards\nEcosystem Grants \nGenesi DAC Investments\n*The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices).\n\nAs we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting decentralized finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets in support of the Web3 economy we are building towards. Through this integration, Aave can also obtain additional revenue through protocol fees as well as through the Metis Builder Mining Program. \n\nMetis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future on Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a strong DeFi ecosystem, and there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, but having a Flagship protocol like Aave has always been our end goal in the realm of money markets. The deployment would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while also complementing Aave’s multichain expansion. \nTechnical Evaluation by BGD\nIn the spirit of security and transparency, Metis worked alongside BGD (Bored Ghosts Developing) to perform a technical evaluation on the Andromeda network. The evaluation consisted of 13 categories, with 4 different possible scores: Optimal, Good, Acceptable, and Needs Improvement. Each of the categories scored as follows:\n\nOracle Infrastructure: Optimal\nBlockchain Explorer: Good\nCompatibility with Ethereum RPC standard: Optimal\nCompatibility with Ethereum account format (addresses): Optimal\nRPC public endpoints and providers: Acceptable\nCustom behavior (lack of) the execution layer: Optimal\nSupport of wallet providers: Good\nOn-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Good\nTransactions simulation infrastructure (fork): Good\nChain data/indexing solutions: Acceptable\nBridging infrastructure: asset, messages: Optimal\nCommitment in security-incidents: Optimal\nNetwork security/technical model: Good\n\n*RPC public endpoints and providers: We integrated Bware services in order to increase the variety of RPC alternatives in the network. We are also in talks with other top tier providers to further bolster our RPC infrastructure. We were in communication with BGD throughout this process to ensure the providers we chose met their technical standards.\n*Chain data/indexing solutions: We’re currently finalizing talks with a top data indexing platform in order to enable the right tooling and services in the ecosystem.\n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-metis-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/11374\n\nRisk Parameter Setting and Asset Listing with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet\nGauntlet and Chaos Labs collaborated to provide a risk analysis and recommendations for the deployment of the Metis Andromeda network. We will follow the recommendations of these trusted risk parties for Aave, for setting both the risk parameters as well as the assets to be listed. \n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-v3-on-metis/7056/61?u=metis\n\n\nIncentivized Adoption\n\nWe are excited to propose a 100,000 Metis token liquidity incentivization campaign throughout a six month period shortly following deployment. We will be working with Chaos Labs to map out the most strategic allocation of these incentives to bolster strong market depth and sticky liquidity, ensuring to follow best industry practices and monitoring the efficacy in real time.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nAssuming a passed deployment vote, we will coordinate with BGD to begin the Aave deployment process and implementation. We expect this process to take roughly four weeks. After the subsequent launch of Aave V3 on Metis, we will monitor the activity and launch the aforementioned liquidity mining incentive program. We will continue to stay in close communication with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet to keep a watchful eye on liquidity levels and inflows, to ensure proposed increases in market caps, congruent with increased liquidity depth on-chain. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with and provide value to both the Aave DAO and community at large, as well as the entire Metis ecosystem.",

Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.\n\nCoinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.\n\nDocs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)\n\nIts mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***\n\nAs a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.\n\nFour key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:\n\n\n**Open-source**\n\nBase is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.\n\n\n\n\n**A bridge, not an island**\n\nBase is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.\n\n\n\n**Decentralization** \n\n Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy \"to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.\n\n\n**For everyone**\n\nBase is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.\n\n \nBase has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.\n\nPlease see the list below of robust launch partners:\n\n \n![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)\n    \n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.\n\nBy enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.\n\nBase is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.\n\nIn the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.\n\nSince Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:\n\n* 2,000,000 accounts created\n* 17,000,000 transactions\n* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests\n\nIn addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers (@Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of the token.\n\n|||||||\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|**Risk Parameter**|**wETH**|**USDC**|**wstETH**|**cbETH**||\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|NO|NO||\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|YES|YES||\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES||\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A||\n|Loan To Value|N/A|82.5%|70.0%|67.0%||\n|Liquidation Threshold|80%|85%|79%|74%||\n|Liquidation Bonus|82.5%|5%|7.2%|7.5%||\n|Reserve Factor|5%|10%|15%|15%||\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|10%|10%||\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|940|1200||\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|6000|10000||\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|0|0||\n|uOptimal|45%|80%|45%|45%||\n|Base|0%|0%|0.25%|0%||\n\n\n\nBase will deploy using the [Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data), which an overview can be found [here](https://static.optimism.io/#adding-a-token-to-the-list).

        "body": "Title: [ARC] Framework For Recognized Delegates\n\nAuthor: @fig - Flipside Crypto\n\nDate: 05-04-2023\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal establishes a baseline set of guidelines and expectations for becoming a Recognized Delegate within Aave.\n\nIt aims to define the role, responsibilities, and characteristics of Aave’s recognized delegates to aid the DAO in addressing and sustainably growing this stakeholder base.\n\nIt is left intentionally sparse in some parts to provide a rich and diverse array of delegates from which AAVE [or equivalent] holders may select their chosen representative(s.)\n\n## Abstract:\n\nThis proposal responds to the community's desire to outline what a recognized delegate looks like, to qualify for potential reimbursement in the current Gas Fee Rebate proposal.\n\nIt creates a framework for becoming or ending one’s role as a recognized delegate.\n\nIn addition, it delineates the distinction between a delegate and a recognized delegate.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nAs Aave attracts more stakeholders, contributors, and delegates, it requires more active management and a clearer organization of the delegate base.\n\nA typical interaction with Governance (roughly) looks something like this:\n\n![91572a4486b9001bdd6927a25f55c5a4f23608bb.png](ipfs://bafkreied3ex3txkxbesko2cf4g3cgn7milsd6sx2l3pz663h25pnxffhnq)\n   \n\nThis graphic illustrates a current dynamic within the DAO; delegates working on behalf of token holders, engaging with Governance or contributors themselves to vote and propose on-chain.\n\nThe more voting power a delegate has (i.e. ACI, Penn Blockchain, LBS,) the larger their responsibility has become, incurring voting costs, deployment costs, and opportunity costs.\n\nThis proposal hopes to create a definition of value-additive, recognized delegates to better organize delegates and proposals such as the [Gas Fee Rebate.\n](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gas-fee-rebate-for-on-chain-votes/12559)\nFurthermore, it is crucial to define fundamental roles and responsibilities to align expectations between the Aave community, AAVE holders, service providers, and other delegates.\n\nIt is important to better define this role to encourage, educate, and guide prospective delegates, and re-affirm the ongoing work of others.\n\n## Specification:\n\nTo be considered a recognized delegate, a prospective delegate must follow these key steps:\n\n**1. Inform the community of their intention to become a delegate**\n\n**2. Post a Delegate Platform on the Aave Governance forum - similar to those from [Wintermute](https://governance.aave.com/t/wintermute-delegate-platform/11504) or [FranklinDAO](https://governance.aave.com/t/franklindao-prev-penn-blockchain-delegate-platform/8850), under the “Delegate Platform” category**\n\n*  The Delegate Platform is a chance for delegates to lay out what they stand for; it is the lens through which AAVE holders and other stakeholders will see Recognized Delegates and their actions.\n*  As delegates grow and change, it is encouraged to update this platform so it reflects the progress and current goals of delegate\n\n**3. Read and acknowledge the Delegate Code of Conduct**\n\n*   The canonical Code of Conduct is defined [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-delegate-code-of-conduct/12981).\n* Acknowledgment is left at the discretion of the delegate - some options include:\n*Signing a message on-chain*\n*Confirming that they have read and agreed to it within their Recognized Delegate platform post*\n*Another creative option such as uploading to IPFS or Swarm :)*\n\n**4. Demonstrate a history of voting on more than five on-chain votes**\n\n**5. Maintain on-chain voting participation rate above 80%**\n\n**6. Report voting rationales via a medium of choice; this could be Aave’s Governance Forum, Medium, Notion, or a personal blog**\n\n## Roles & Responsibilities\n\nThe role of a Recognized Delegate can be expressed in three parts:\n\n1. Participation in forum discussions\n2. Expression of opinion in on & off-chain Governance processes by casting regular votes\n3. Communication of their voting decisions and the rationale behind them\n\nIt is essential to the Governance process in Aave that Recognized Delegates vote, particularly regarding on-chain AIPs, as these execute the technical changes required for the operation and security of Aave.\n\nBy expecting Recognized Delegates to communicate their votes, we may ensure that there is sufficient transparency to allow delegators to evaluate whether their chosen Recognized Delegate is acting in their – and Aave's best interests.\n\nThis responsibility provides valuable feedback to proposal authors; if a proposal is unsuccessful, this feedback may allow for a refined proposal to pass the Governance process.\n\nBeyond this, Recognized Delegates may take on additional roles and responsibilities as they see fit. \nExamples might include:\n\n* Authoring Governance proposals\n* Evaluating proposals in the TEMP CHECK or ARFC stage on the Aave forum\n* Participating in calls and discussions centered on issues related to Aave\n\nThe community may decide to author future proposals that require a Recognized Delegate to take on additional roles and responsibilities - but these key responsibilities should remain intact.\n\n## Recognized Delegate Resignation [End of Term]\n\nIf a Recognized Delegate wishes to step down from their role, they should take steps to ensure that their delegators and the Aave community are informed.\n\nAt a minimum, this should include a post in their Delegate Platform thread. We recommend that a team may notify the DAO as early as possible to ensure voting power is transitioned.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNext steps to ensure a successful framework of recognized delegates:\n\n1. Gather feedback and input from the Aave community on the proposed requirements\n2. Incorporate and refine the proposal based on feedback from the community\n3. Upgrade and communicate the new requirements to current and new delegates\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH.\n\nLSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.\n\nOnboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.\n\nAave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.\n\nRocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem.\n\nSpecification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal.\nIncreasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions.\n\nthe ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators.\nRocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH\nrETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH.\nThe rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time.\nSimply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.\nWithout a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.\nRocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold.\nAbstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nrETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.\nrETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.\nrETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.\nrETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.\nrETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years.\nThe Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021.\nrETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2\nThe Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool — Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2\n5. How is the rETH token currently used?\n\nBalancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M\n\nUniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity\n\nrETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI\n\nimage\nimage\n1231×203 17.2 KB\nIt’s likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding.\n\nSee the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\nrETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\nThe Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities.\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $287 118 738\n24H Volume ~$3.75M\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\n\nExchanges:\n\nBalancer (main source of liquidity)\nUniswap\nCurve\nBancor\nFurther information here: Rocket Pool Explorer 4 2 and Dune 1\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 17770 1 members\nTwitter: 34548 followers\nGithub: 66 followers\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nThe below applies to just wstETH on Optimism:\n\nDate of Deployment: Sep 30th 2021\nNumber of Transactions: 73358\nNumber of holders for token: 9104 (liquidity pools are recorded as 1 address)\nTechnical Specifications\nA comprehensive technical analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO technical team here is their report:\n\n[rETH] ERC20 Token Smart Contract Technical Assessment 2\n\nSecurity Considerations\nRocketPool smart contracts have been independently audited by three best-in-class audit firms:\n\nhttps://rocketpool.net/files/sigma-prime-audit.pdf 1\nRocketpool | ConsenSys Diligence\npublications/RocketPool.pdf at master · trailofbits/publications · GitHub 1\nbug bounty: https://immunefi.com/bounty/rocketpool/\n\nRisk Analysis\nA comprehensive risk analysis has been conducted by the Maker DAO risk team here is their report:\n\n[rETH] Collateral Onboarding Risk Evaluation 9\n\nRisk parameters\nThe Following Risk parameters are the result of Chaos Labs & Gauntlet risk teams joint work.\n\nAs such, we recommend the following parameters:\n\nIsolation Mode - No\n\nWhile isolation mode provides newer, untested assets a safe backdrop to evolve, by only allowing stablecoin borrowing, in the context of rETH however, it excludes potentially the largest use case of rETH collateral, which is to borrow correlated assets in WETH or wstETH. Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.\n\nBorrowable - Yes\n\nWe are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aave’s markets.\n\nLT - 74%; LTV 67%\n\nWe recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we’ve identified above.\n\nLB - 7.5%\n\nWe recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH.\n\nRF - 15%\n\nLPF - 0.1\n\nDebt Ceiling - NA\n\nSupply Cap - 10K\n\nBorrow Cap - 1200\n\nOur analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets.\n\n| Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap |\n| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |\n| rETH   | NO             | YES        | YES                | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A         | 10K       | 1200      |\n\n\n## Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor\n\nrETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later.\n\nParameter | Recommendation\n--------- | -------------\nBase | 0\nSlope 1 | 0.07\nUoptimal | 0.45\nSlope 2 | 3.0\nReserve Factor | 0.15\n\nUnder these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI). From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.",

    "summary": "The proposal requests $125,000 over 6 months for Flipside Crypto to act as a contributor to the Aave DAO, aiming to improve coordination, governance infrastructure, community engagement, and data analytics. The voting timeline shows unanimous and stable early support for the YAE option. Forum sentiment analysis reveals a predominance of positive comments supporting the proposal and recognizing Flipside's contributions and expertise, though some concerns about scope overlap and coordination roles were raised. Similar past proposals related to Aave V3 deployments had positive vote outcomes but mixed market responses. The recommendation is to approve the proposal to change, as it aligns with community sentiment and aims to enhance DAO operational efficiency.",
