Tokens impacted include USDP, FRAX, USDT, GUSD, WETH, WBTC, WAVAX, and WMATIC. Forum post can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v2-interest-rate-curve-recommendations-from-gauntlet-2023-04-21/12846).\n\n# Abstract\nGiven the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntletâ€™s platform has evaluated all assets on Aave V2's Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche markets and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Last November, we proposed interest rate curve changes for the Aave V2 Ethereum market using our interest rate curve optimization framework. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk. This analysis further finetunes the interest rate curves of Aave V2 Ethereum, and extends our methodology to Polygon and Avalanche.\n\n## Objectives\nAmong other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:\n\n1. **mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool**\n2. **build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future**\n\nAs a secondary objective, we want to **optimize the user experience of Aave's borrowers and suppliers**.\n\n## Specification\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UBumbXp.png)\n\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

Tokens impacted include stable coins (USDT, MAI, FRAX, EURS, agEUR), Large Cap (WETH), and Small Cap (GHST, DPI). \n\nMore details can be found in the [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-gauntlet-interest-rate-curve-changes-for-aave-v3-markets-feb-2023/11851).\n\n# Abstract\n\nGiven the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet's platform has evaluated all assets on Aave V3 and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Last November, we proposed [interest rate curve changes for the Aave V2 Ethereum market](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-interest-rate-curve-changes-for-aave-v2-eth-november-2022/10884) using our interest rate curve optimization framework. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk. This analysis applies this same methodology to the active Aave V3 markets.\n\n# Methodology\n\nAmong other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve: \n\n1) mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool \n2) build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future\n\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe table below summarizes the proposed interest rate and reserve factor parameters on the V3 markets, with changes denoted by an arrow. As an example - for MAI, the parameter changes are intended for Avax V3 and Polygon V3. \n\n| Parameter | USDT | FRAX | MAI | EURS | agEUR | WETH | GHST | DPI |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Variable Base | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0â†’0.01 | 0 | 0 |\n| Stable Base | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.09â†’0.068 | 0.09 | 0.09 |\n| Uoptimal | 0.9â†’0.8 | 0.9â†’0.8 | 0.9â†’0.8 | 0.9â†’0.8 | 0.9â†’0.8 | 0.45â†’0.8 | 0.45 | 0.45 |\n| Variable Slope 1 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.07â†’0.038 | 0.07 | 0.07 |\n| Variable Slope 2 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 3.0â†’0.8 | 3 | 3 |\n| Stable Slope 1 | 0.005 | 0.005 | 0.005 | 0.005 | 0.005 | 0.0â†’0.04 | 0 | 0 |\n| Stable Slope 2 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.6â†’0.75 | 0.0â†’0.8 | 0 | 0 |\n| Reserve Factor | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1â†’0.2 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.1â†’0.15 | 0.2â†’0.35 | 0.2â†’0.35 |\n| Affected Markets | Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon | Avalanche | Avalanche, Polygon | Arbitrum, Polygon | Polygon | Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon | Polygon | Polygon |\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n\n",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across one (1) Aave V2 asset. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of recommendations follows [AIP 117](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=117) to further de-risk the REN market. \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowersâ€™ aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ktXGW6P.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowersâ€™ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zoCKkVn.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowersâ€™ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xO974Ct.png)\n\n**Price changes of key assets since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9D7yUOW.png)\n\n**Time series of Value at Risk (VaR) since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R8enrDr.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and percentage of total REN supplies:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m3qrkWx.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and borrow usages:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CNBpVd8.png)\n\n**Entire supply positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rMEczds.png)\n\n**Entire borrow positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HEKWdu8.png)\n\n\nBelow, Gauntlet analyzes the user which contributes the most Value at Risk per our simulations.\n\nUser: `0x364d5077c4c6bce6280705fe657fc4c55fdac363`\n\n**User supply breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QZW65gh.png)\n\n**Relevant collateral factors**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nOdid9p.png)\n\n**User borrowing power breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xsPK0i7.png)\n\n**User borrows breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1Tz7Anr.png)\n\n**User borrow usage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Tnwhl0a.png)\n\nNote that this user has been elastic as of late, updating their token positions often.\n\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\nThese parameter recommendations reflect the unique situation of REN in the current market conditions.  \n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **REN Liquidation Threshold**     | 65%     | ***60%***     |\n| **REN Loan To Value**     | 60%     | ***55%***     |\n\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 11/16/2022, the data shows that only one dust account, `0x0e1337ea2c604f9a937d2623af206cdd02167b38` would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This account has a total of ~$100 in supply.\n\nThis could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-11-21\n\n## Quick Links\n[Analytics Dashboard](https://metabase.gauntlet.network/public/dashboard/f4930651-29be-4ff3-b664-a34462e286c5)\n[Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave)\n[Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc)\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) \n\nGauntlet launched an insolvency refund for Aave that contains a portion of our payment stream that can be clawed back in the event of insolvencies due to market risk. Since our last recommendation there have been no new insolvencies in Aave. Gauntletâ€™s Insolvency Refund vault is still live and can be seen here [0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

        "author": "0xDD659911EcBD4458db07Ee7cDdeC79bf8F859AbC",
        "body": "\n\n## Simple Summary\nGauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify liquidation bonus on two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets without adding outsized market risk.\n\n\nAdditionally, we provide user position analysis below.\n\n\n\n## Abstract\nThese parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntletâ€™s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n\n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V3 Optimism\n\n**Top 30 borrowersâ€™ aggregate positions**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/z2TdjKA.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowersâ€™ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XSupkvw.png)\n\n\n**Top 30 borrowersâ€™ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2QUPmL2.png)\n\n\n\n# Optimism Recs\n\n## Aave V3 Optimism Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by lowering the liquidation bonus for WBTC and raising the liquidation bonus for sUSD on Optimism Aave v3.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n|  WBTC Liquidation Bonus   |  10.0%    | 9.4%  |\n|  sUSD Liquidation Bonus   |   5.0%   | 5.4% |\n\n\n\n\n\n## Aave V3 Optimism Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V3 Optimism Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aavev3_optimism) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V3 Optimism.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V3 Optimism Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3Qn8k5v.png)\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",
