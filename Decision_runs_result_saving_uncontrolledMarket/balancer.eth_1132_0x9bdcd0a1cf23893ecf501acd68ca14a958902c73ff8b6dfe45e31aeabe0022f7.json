        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1763\n\n**Summary:**\n> This is a proposal on behalf of InceptionLRT to enable a gauge for inwstETHs/WETH on Ethereum. inwstETHs represents wstETH restaked on Symbiotic, through whitelisted Mellow and Symbiotic curated vaults. InceptionLRT will delegate wstETH to curators based on governance voting decision.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Website](https://www.inceptionlrt.com/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.inceptionlrt.com/)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/inceptionlrt/smart-contracts)    \n    • [Communities](https://discord.com/invite/RSAtmyXcSk)\n    • [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/InceptionLRT)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> InceptionLRT is the infrastructure layer decentralizing restaking by positioning curators as the cornerstone of the ecosystem.\nBy addressing the complexity and fragmentation of restaking in a transparent and DAO-governed way, InceptionLRT has pioneered and advanced the concept of Multi-Curator LRTs!\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> InceptionLRT aims to enable a gauge for inwstETHs/WETH to substantially increase the liquidity of inwstETHs, while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols, namely Morpho, Compound and Gearbox.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** ING holders participate in decision-making, influencing the protocol’s direction and policies, including the Node Operators, AVSs and restaking strategies.\nIncentive Allocation: Through gauge weight voting, veING holders direct incentives and rewards towards preferred liquidity, impacting the protocol’s dynamics.\nRewards and Participation: Providing ING to liquidity pools like the 80-20 Balancer Liquidity Pools and locking the LP token earns veING, granting access to various protocol.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Rate Provider for [inwstETHs](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae48B92CBc0882a7D70D878e42cc121a62ceB632).\n\n3. **Audits:** InceptionLRT undergoes security audits and checks to ensure the safety of user funds. Latest: [Audit Reports | InceptionLRT Docs](https://docs.inceptionlrt.com/security/audit-reports).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** inwstETHs architecture involves delegations to Mellow and Symbiotic contracts.\n\n5. **Market History:** No major volatility - [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/inception-restaked-steth-symbiotic).\n \n6. **Value:** The pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for inwstETHs on Ethereum and allow for a healthy stimulation of volume.\nGauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6B8B1376F7E2A9aDA08D0B8bAcF5e0baD8B9B4ea",
