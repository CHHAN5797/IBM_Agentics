As we have historically seen high demand on Base, compared to Arbitrum we are expanding this pair to base and by enabling gauge rewards, this pool will attract additional TVL, benefiting both protocols while creating one of the highest-yielding stable opportunities on Base.\n\nhttps://dune.com/queries/4756760/7896201\n\nThis integration creates synergies between YieldFi, Balancer, and Aave, boosting activity across all three ecosystems.\n\n**Protocol Description**:\n\nyUSD is the yield bearing token by YieldFi deployed on Base and is backed by stablecoins like USDC/USDT/USR/wstUSR that strategically allocates assets across blue-chip DeFi protocols to generate 10-20% yields (currently 10.23% APY). The product features daily yield distribution, institutional-grade security, and full on-chain transparency.\n\nwaBasUSDC is the wrapped version of Aave's interest-bearing aBasUSDC on Base, which allows users to earn yield from USDC deposits in Aave.\n\n**Specifications**:\n\nGovernance: YieldFi operates with a multi-sig wallet requiring 3/5 signatures from core team members\n\nOracles: https://docs.yield.fi/resources/oracles\n\nAudits: https://docs.yield.fi/resources/audits\n\nCentralization vectors: The primary centralization vectors include the multi-sig custody and professional team management of yield strategies (necessary for optimal returns)\n\nMarket History: yUSD has maintained perfect positive yieldcurve with no drawdown since launch with zero instances of depegging.\n\nhttps://dune.com/queries/4785783/7937254\n\n**Technical Specifications**:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address):\n0xGaugeAddress: [https://basescan.org/address/0x7Ac2f85069470959f5960B6054479aD46dB4d818\n](https://basescan.org/address/0x7Ac2f85069470959f5960B6054479aD46dB4d818)0xRootGaugeAddress: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0D3F5D4022279c536a53aaa6bb8c225A0226d168\n\n0xPoolAddress: https://basescan.org/address/0x424d19d482a891b2c5cb881d651fbc32b349cb3c\n\ngaugeType(string): Base",

USDX captures yield from crypto-native sources and distributes it back to its users.\n\n* sUSDX is a staked version of USDX; yield for sUSDX currently stands around 19%.\n\n* USDT is a fiat-backed USD-denominated stablecoin, issued by Tether.\n\n## Motivation\n\n* usdx.money has recently launched its points campaign, and expects the TVL to rapidly increase. With increased TVL, usdx.money is committed to building robust liquidity for sUSDX/USDX and USDX/USDT pairs on Arbitrum Chain to facilitate secondary liquidity for USDX and sUSDX. We are seeking to bootstrap majority of our liquidity on Balancer, and this will help onboard more users to both usdx.money and Balancer.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. **Governance**: currently owned by 0x3f9a06aD4c83c289DF83461fE5F24EE4c4491935 (3 out of 4 multisig).\n\n2. **Oracles**: The protocol does not reply on external oracles.\n\n3. **Audits**: [link](https://1166152427-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F5mdBNVoaU0Rn0IEZP0Y1%2Fuploads%2FAGLbaiVubfT1xuY1FdmH%2FBlocksec_Security_Audit_Report_for_USDX.pdf?alt=media&token=6326b906-c1b4-49cd-b670-666baee5d030). Additional audit reports can be viewed on https://docs.usdx.money/informaiton/audit\n\n4. **Centralization vectors**: The centralization vectors primarily relate to the owner of the contracts, which is a 3 out of 4 multisig. The team has 15 full-time, doxxed contributors.\n\n5. **Market history**: USDX has not previously de-pegged, and sUSDX is an ERC4626 token. Balancer pools for USDX/USDT and sUSDX/USDX have just been deployed.\n\n* Addresses for USDX/USUSDT\n\n  * Pool address: https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x85564af67760063b994599b640552614238c9ee60000000000000000000005e3\n\n  * Arbitrum Child Gauge: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7bbD2B8932610dEC2698C63fC28130224A339Df2#readContract\n\n  * Mainnet Root Gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f244e8ac0FF2d2af14368fd8EFd1E508a50CF68\n* Addresses for sUSDX/USDX\n\n  * Pool address: https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xb3047330c1cb5eb1a3670fabfb99bdc106d631eb0000000000000000000005e4\n\n  * Arbitrum Child Gauge: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x83bE87529aC31d06fEc49FF5Aedd6290b81D0700\n\n  * Mainnet Root Gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d1b58fB1fC10F2160178DE1eAE2d520335ee372\n\n6. **Value**: USDX currently has $210m in TVL, making it the th largest protocol by TVL on [BNB Chain](https://defillama.com/chain/BSC). As the protocol rolls out points program on Arbitrum, we intend for Balancer pools to be the primary source of liquidity for USDX and sUSDX on Arbitrum.\n\n### Technical Specification\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: gauge(address):`0x5f244e8ac0FF2d2af14368fd8EFd1E508a50CF68` gaugeType(string): `Arbitrum` gauge(address):`0x0d1b58fB1fC10F2160178DE1eAE2d520335ee372` gaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

USDX captures yield from crypto-native sources and distributes it back to its users.\n* sUSDX is a staked version of USDX; yield for sUSDX currently stands around 10%.\n* USDT is a fiat-backed USD-denominated stablecoin, issued by Tether.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n* Stables Labs has recently concluded Season 1 of its points campaign, and saw rapid increase in its TVL. Our previous collaboration with Balancer has proven extremely effective, as our sUSDX/USDX became Balancer v2 Arbitrum's biggest pool (TVL ~$10M). sUSDX/USDX/aUSDT Balancer v3 pool will allow users to enjoy greater yield, and deep pool of liquidity to swap through.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance**: currently owned by 0x3f9a06aD4c83c289DF83461fE5F24EE4c4491935 (3 out of 4 multisig).\n2. **Oracles**: The protocol does not reply on external oracles.\n3. **Audits**: [link](https://1166152427-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F5mdBNVoaU0Rn0IEZP0Y1%2Fuploads%2FAGLbaiVubfT1xuY1FdmH%2FBlocksec_Security_Audit_Report_for_USDX.pdf?alt=media&token=6326b906-c1b4-49cd-b670-666baee5d030). Additional audit reports can be viewed on [Audit | usdx.money](https://docs.usdx.money/informaiton/audit)\n4. **Centralization vectors**: The centralization vectors primarily relate to the owner of the contracts, which is a 3 out of 4 multisig. The team has 15 full-time, doxxed contributors.\n5. **Market history**: USDX has not previously de-pegged, and sUSDX is an ERC4626 token. Balancer pools for USDX/USDT and sUSDX/USDX have just been deployed.\n6. **Value**: USDX currently has $620M in TVL, making it the 4th largest protocol by TVL on [BNB Chain](https://defillama.com/chain/BSC), and 5th largest protocol by TVL on [Arbitrum](https://defillama.com/chain/Arbitrum). We will also be launching Season 2 of our points program soon, which would bring healthy amount of attention and activities around USDX.\n\nsUSDX -USDX-aUSDT Pool https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v3/0xc2B0D1A1B4cdDA10185859B5a5c543024c2df869\n\nChild Gauge [https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9419c8b7ff370db3823164acea6d9664f4b9c8a9](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9419c8b7ff370db3823164acea6d9664f4b9c8a9)\n\nRoot Gauge [https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb312b0d7795743C3DE905bc09c0D62aA180A7a6](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb312b0d7795743C3DE905bc09c0D62aA180A7a6)\n\n## Technical Specifications:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): [`0xeb312b0d7795743C3DE905bc09c0D62aA180A7a6`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb312b0d7795743C3DE905bc09c0D62aA180A7a6)\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nEdits by Maxis:\n1. modified child chain and root gauges\n2.

It has been co-operating the Balancer deployment on optimism since 2022. $BEETS is the governance token of Beethoven X; on optimism, the token is bridged by Layerzero as a OFT. \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> This is to establish $BEETS liquidity on optimism. $BEETS token (the old multichain bridged version) has been used to incentivize liquidity through direct emission and voting incentives on optimism. The $BEETS token has recently been migrated to the Layerzero bridged version due to the multichain incidence (see [governance vote](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0xa3454614baec1abe0905d0abe6d1f08b53cae73879000dfcc8bd7c872419910c)). Hence, moving on the layerzero bridged version will be used. The pool will facilitate trading and holding of $BEETS on optimism. \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** The BEETS governance is through maBEETS on fantom. \n\n2. **Oracles:** No\n\n3. **Audits:** BeethovenX is a friendly fork of Balancer and has been [independently audited](https://docs.beets.fi/ecosystem/security). \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** No\n\n5. **Market History:** $BEETS token has a history for more than 2 years and is a well established token. \n \n6. **Value:** This pool will be the primary liquidity of $BEETS on optimism. The pairing with interest bearing $rETH would also earn protocol fees for Balancer. \n\n\nPool address: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0xc1f46ce83439886f0ea9c21512b36e7e67239d2c000200000000000000000108\n\nChild gauge: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x53bFf7a10181E4Fa2a92011dE9816220E0DaDd41\n\nRoot gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x20D03f9D0304744891881e6ac1D45b996e7F39B5#code\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x20D03f9D0304744891881e6ac1D45b996e7F39B5`\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/884\n\n## Summary:\n\n* This is a proposal to enable a Balancer gauge for a sfrxETH/cbETH pool on Balancer on Base.\n* This will be a core pool.\n* The pool has been launched [here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/base/pool/0x98bedb6a3c0b6feebbe662e6419481a6877d9681000000000000000000000104)\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nLink to:\n\n• [Website](https://frax.finance/)\n\n• [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/)\n\n• [Github Page](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity)\n\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nsfrxETH is a staked interest bearing version of FRAX’s staked ETH (frxETH). Coinbase Wrapped Staked ETH (cbETH) represents your staked Ethereum (ETH) in a tradable form. You can unwrap cbETH at any time. cbETH provides flexibility to sell, transfer, or use it. You can move cbETH to a personal wallet and trade it outside the Coinbase platform.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nAs a joint effort with FRAX, we aim to increase liquidity of FRAX, sFRAX, frxETH, sfrxETH, to make Balancer a liquidity hub for Frax assets on Base. The BAL gauge and core pool status will facilitate the process.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n* Governance: FRAX governance process can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/smart-contracts/governance) and their snapshot [here](https://snapshot.org/#/frax.eth).\n* Oracles: Chainlink feed for rate can be found [here](https://data.chain.link/feeds/base/base/sfrxETH-frxETH).\n* Audits: See [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits)\n* Centralization vectors: see [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/overview).\n* Market History: See [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-ether/frxeth-and-sfrxeth)\n* Value: Balancer will earn the protocol fee on interest bearing sfrxETH and cbETH in the pool and so will LPs. The BIP-19 flywheel will incentivize TVL to grow here with trading volume and our staked ethereum pillars will continue to have Balancer as their ideal liquidity destination.\n\nLink to pool: https://app.balancer.fi/#/base/pool/0x98bedb6a3c0b6feebbe662e6419481a6877d9681000000000000000000000104\n\nLink to child gauge: [0x1cadBEFEB5461a671CfAAf5faC237aF00baC0B1c](https://basescan.org/address/0x1cadBEFEB5461a671CfAAf5faC237aF00baC0B1c#code)\n\nLink to root gauge: [0x3CFfb5d5Db1dA8AA58908e54C03a7f8a7edb233c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3CFfb5d5Db1dA8AA58908e54C03a7f8a7edb233c)\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x3CFfb5d5Db1dA8AA58908e54C03a7f8a7edb233c`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Base`",
