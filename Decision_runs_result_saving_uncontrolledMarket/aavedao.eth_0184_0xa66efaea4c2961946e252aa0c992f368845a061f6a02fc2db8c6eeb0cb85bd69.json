        "body": "Author: Peter from the Origin Protocol core team\nDate: 2024-09-18\n\n### 1. Simple Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding supply/borrow support for wOETH on:\n\n- Aave v3 Main Ethereum Instance\n\nIf the onboarding of OETH to Aave is successful, Origin hopes to discuss an additional onboarding of wOETH to:\n\n- Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Aave v3 EtherFi Instance\n\n### 2. Motivation/Background\n\n[Origin Ether](https://oeth.com/)(OETH) was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 that generates yield while sitting in your wallet. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nUntil a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0x76f64251d37310c5d241ec84a892751c7a34874faff7af848db193141ea24a6f) earlier this year, OETH was an LST aggregator that earned yield by tapping into blue-chip protocols while being collateralized by other LSTs. Over the weeks following, the ability to deploy OETH collateral to other projects was removed and LST collateral was divested back to ETH, as OETH transitioned into a full-fledged LST with an extremely tight peg (1:1 redemptions to ETH thru Origin's [ARM](https://www.originprotocol.com/arm-announcement)) and high yields thanks to DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p.\n\nWe've noticed many LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This will not be the case with OETH.\n\nUsing OETH on Aave will produce higher yield than other top LSTs and have a near perfect ETH peg. OETH ARM mechanics and gas optimizations will ensure the best possible prices for traders looking for instant exit liquidity, while DVT staking will achieve greater risk-adjusted yield. Our vision for OETH is for it to become the most trusted LST for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking.\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, users can convert their ETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on Curve OETH/ETH: [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on Uniswap OETH/ETH: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x52299416C469843F4e0d54688099966a6c7d720f)\n- Swapping on Curve OETH/frxETH: [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-353/deposit)\n\nwOETH is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the [contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192) (function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.\n\nCurrent exchange rate as of 9/18/24: 1 wOETH = 1.104402 OETH\n\n#### Security Considerations\n\nThere is no set emission schedule for OETH. Similar to stETH, OETH is minted on demand when users lock their ETH into the protocol, and burned on demand when users exit OETH for the collateral. The OETH protocol is upgradeable by a 5 of 8 multi-sig and there is a 48-hour timelock before any changes go into effect. You can read more about that in the [admin section](https://docs.originprotocol.com/ogn/governance#guardians) of the OETH docs.\n\nOETH and wOETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. All OETH audits can be found in the [audits section](https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits) of the OETH docs. We have recently retained [yAudit](https://yaudit.dev/) to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes. Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program is currently administered by [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/origindefi/), where Origin maintains a median resolution time of 6 hours.\n\nOETH/wOETH price feeds are available by ChainLink across Mainnet, Arbitrum and Base. OETH price feeds are also available via alternative oracle providers Tellor and Dia Data. OETH likely qualifies for a Correlated-Asset Price Oracle (CAPO) based on [similar LSTs](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-correlated-price-asset-onboarding/17012) that have qualified.\n\n#### Performance\n\nThe [current](https://www.originprotocol.com/analytics/oeth) OETH TVL sits comfortably at $71m with a native yield of 4.43% APY:\n\n![OETH TVL](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/83e3d47e8afac53131a7307367270c22178e6fa3.png)\n\nOETH features the highest native APY on [Defillama](https://defillama.com/lsd) for LST projects with over $6m in TVL.

This new OETH market would lead to additional increased TVL for Aave, additional revenue to the Aave Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base due to OETH being higher yielding over the other Aave supported LSTs.\n\n#### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nThe Origin Protocol team is open to providing both token incentives and seed liquidity to jumpstart the wOETH market on Aave once wOETH is onboarded. More accurate amounts will be discussed with the Aave team and the ACI and can be shared during the ARFC stage of the proposal process.\n\n### 3.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard ggAVAX to Aave V3 on Avalanche \nDate: 2024-04-29\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe current proposal is set to add ggAVAX, a liquid staking AVAX token issued by the Gogopool protocol, to the AAVE V3 Avalanche market.\n\n### Motivation\n\nGoGoPool is one of the largest Avalanche DeFi protocols. It is ranked number 6 on the Avalanche C-Chain in terms of TVL chain and currently controls more than 500k AVAX (~$23M at current market prices).\n\nWe believe there is currently very large underserved demand for borrowing AVAX against ggAVAX, as ggAVAX is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche. The APYs currently range between 7% and 8%, which is on the order of 33% more yield than any existing competitors on Avalanche. \n\nBeing the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche makes ggAVAX perfect for being a collateral asset, especially for those who seek leveraged exposure to native AVAX yields.\n\n \n![dd93fbd27bc1aac727035529eb5ff6253f57edc8.png](ipfs://bafkreibcfworgked4rc5maanvobvklqy6rmwchfk7rjyoswvyd2chpzsbu)\n    \n\n\nThis yield is achieved through a mix of no protocol fees, running validators instead of utilizing delegation mechanisms, and generating MEV yield from positive market interactions (see dashboard for more details: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK)). \n\nThere is currently more than ~80k AVAX in the ggAVAX-AVAX pools across Balancer and Wombat, making it the most liquid Avalanche LST relative to its size.\n\n \n![8867ec44b2d0dc326eaf4b928b7d7c889eb5f113.png](ipfs://bafkreig3f2xualvcqedjubvgg66tj3jwfkccocvm53l5dc5xtmmo6r5px4)\n    \n\n\nBesides the deep on-chain liquidity, ggAVAX allows users to redeem ggAVAX for underlying AVAX at an internal rate and with no fees. These redemptions are instant as long as there is enough AVAX in the ggAVAX smart contract to facilitate them.\n\nGoGoPool is backed by the Avalanche Foundation and industry-leading investors. In 2022, It raised $7.5M in two rounds [led by Framework Ventures and Coinfund and](https://www.theblock.co/post/166498/gogopool-raises-5-million-to-provide-decentralized-staking-on-avalanche?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) with participation from Silverstone Ventures, Fintech Collective, and Avalaunch. \n\nThe protocol has been [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/GoGoPool%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Kudelski Security](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f90a8443126c2ee50f4c4e/643ee88bf91b375b39ba2613_Kudelski_multisig_labs_report_1.1.pdf) with an additional [Code4rena](https://docs.gogopool.com/audits/code4rena-audit) audit contest. It also has an ongoing [bug bounty program with Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/gogopool/).\n\n### Benefits of listing ggAVAX\n\nListing of ggAVAX on AAVE would create additional demand for borrowing AVAX (in E-Mode) and other assets. Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.\n\nCurrently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nAave V3 on Avalanche.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWith the recent implementation of [Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51), ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed. This is the same approach that AAVE currently uses for sAVAX, wstETH, cbETH, weETH and other LSTs (and LRTs)\n\nggAVAX’s CAPO, however, might require a max growth ratio higher than the 10.1% currently set for sAVAX to account for a generally higher level of yield.\n\nWe welcome any questions about ggAVAX architecture and protocol structure and look forward to working on this with the DAO.\n\n### Specification\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (ggAVAX)|70,000|\n|Borrow Cap (ggAVAX)|NA|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|\n|LTV|30.00%|\n|LT|40.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|NA|\n|Variable Slope2|NA|\n|Uoptimal|NA|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|Emode|No|\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments\n\nGoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.\n\nAfter the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults. \n\nThese and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general. Note that we have already had preliminary talks with a number of protocols on this subject.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://www.gogopool.com/) \n\n[Github](https://github.com/multisig-labs/)\n\n[Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK) \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogopool_)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gogopool.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. \n\nTo enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).\n\nCurrently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. \n\nOther liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. \n\nThe liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\nIntegrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.\n\nConfidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\n [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.\n\nIntegration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.\n\n### Specification\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Audits & Relevant links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n Issuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nWhitepaper: CDCETH\nDeFillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: https://crypto.com/staking\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\n\nCommunity:\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/cryptocom\nTelegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nNews on Telegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nDiscord: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "## [ARFC]  Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum\n\n## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-08-12\n---\n\n> ARFC has been updated with Risk Parameters provided by both Risk Service Providers after having reservations with exchange rate oracles. 2024-08-12\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 800 Mn+ (~270k Eth) TVL\n- 20K+ restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH, sfrxETH, and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\n*> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-08-09 and ARFC has been updated.* It is recommended listing rsETH using an exchange rate oracle. \n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 19,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,900 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-Correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9.83% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn\n    - Few others\n- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)\n\n**Oracles**:\n\nrsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:\n\nChainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6\n\nChainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nRedstone market feed:\n\n[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nrsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.\n\nAccepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.\n\nExchange rate calculation -\n\nA → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain\n\nB → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]\n\nC → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]\n\nD → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]\n\nE → Total supply of rsETH\n\nExchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nPrior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. \n\nNevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n* [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n* Contract Address:[ 0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n* [GitHub Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
