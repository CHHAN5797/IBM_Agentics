For more details about LUSD please refers to [Aave V3 ARC by ACI](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-lusd-to-ethereum-v3-market/11522).\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform. The risk parameters provided are the same as those adopted on the ETH V3 pool.\n\nThe newly proposed risk parameters replicating the LUSD parameters on L1 are merely suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI is inviting Risk Service Providers to provide feedback on them.\n\nLUSD is a growing stablecoin within the Optimism ecosystem, with liquidity mainly located in Velodrome Stableswap pools.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nTicker: LUSD\n\nContract Address: 0xc40F949F8a4e094D1b49a23ea9241D289B7b2819\n\n| Risk Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | NO |\n| Loan To Value | N/A |\n| Liquidation Threshold | N/A |\n| Liquidation Bonus | N/A |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | N/A |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,210k |\n| Supply Cap | 3,000k |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A |\n| Base | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 4% |\n| Uoptimal | 80% |\n| Slope2 | 87% |\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nThe ACI is not affiliated with Liquidity or any other entity and has not received payment to present this ARFC.\n\nAt the time of writing, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, does not possess any LQTY, the native asset of the Liquity protocol, and holds only a small amount of LUSD.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
