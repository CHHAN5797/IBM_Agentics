        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across four (4) Aave V3 Optimism assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. \n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC, WETH, USDC, and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$470,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**\n\n### Liquidity and Position Analysis:\n\nThe TVL in Aave on Optimism (115.5M$) is concentrated primarily on two blue-chip, high-liquidity assets, which together account for ~75% of the supplied assets in $ values: USDC (44%) and Ethereum (30%), with the remaining supply, mostly being WBTC (13%). As we see adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations with minimal slippage on these assets, we recommend increasing the LT and LTV for them and one additional high-liquidity asset (DAI). Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (7%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).\n\n**WETH**\n\nWe have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. There are a few positions that supply 1-4M$ WETH each and borrow USDC against it; with the chain's current liquidity, it is possible to liquidate these positions with slippage far below the liquidation penalty. \n\n**WBTC and DAI**\n\nWe have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations, however, we should call out that around 50% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have proposed an [amendment to the supply cap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-supply-and-borrow-cap-updates-aave-v3-2023-02-24/12048/4) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.\n\nGiven the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react. \n\n**USDC**\n\nWe have identified a large position that supplies approximately 75% of USDC on Optimism and does not borrow against its ~$40M USDC position, and therefore does not currently pose a liquidation/bad debt risk to the protocol.  \n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recs | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WETH | Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 85% | +2.5% |\n| WETH | Loan-to-Value | 80% | 82.5% | +2.5% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 7% | -3% |\n| DAI | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 82% | +2% |\n| DAI | Loan-to-Value | 75% | 77% | +2% |\n| USDC | Liquidation Threshold | 85% | 86% | +1% |\n| USDC | Loan-to-Value | 80% | 81% | +1% |",

Specifically, the current values of LT and LTV for multiple assets can be safely increased to improve capital efficiency at a very low or no additional bad debt risk due to price volatility. This assumption is backed by simulation sweeps across a large range of values, measuring low Extreme Value-at-Risk (P99 bad debt) value even as LT is increased significantly.  \n\n**WETH and WBTC**\n\nWe have not identified any “whale” positions or activity affecting our recommendations.\n\n**USDC**\n\nWe have identified two large positions that supply ~45% of USDC on Arbitrum.

This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters in cases the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\n#### Increase LTs + LTVs (WAVAX and LINK.e)\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WAVAX and LINK.e, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with a minor effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n## Recommendations:\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recomm. | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WAVAX | Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WAVAX | Loan-to-Value | 65% | 68% | +3% |\n| LINK.e | Liquidation Threshold | 65% | 68% | +3% |\n| LINK.e | Loan-to-Value | 50% | 53% | +3% |",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust four (4) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across two (2) Aave V3 Ethereum assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave V3 Ethereum was launched successfully on January 27th, 2023, with a conservative configuration for the initial assets, as [recommended](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-aave-v3-ethereum-initial-parameters/11159) by Chaos Labs.\n\nFollowing the successful launch and after analyzing the initial supply and borrow distribution and general usage across the deployment, we propose incrementally increasing the LTs and LTVs for USDC and DAI with the following goals:\n\n1. Provide a sustainable set of parameters that are better optimized for risk-reward in the long term.\n2. Serve as a catalyst to promote migration of funds from V2 to V3, as capital efficiency under the current parameter settings is significantly inferior to V2.\n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit our proposed changes by ±3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nIt is important to note that V3 Ethereum still needs to be integrated into our parameter recommendation platform, and therefore the recommendations provided here are not simulation-based. However, from running our simulations on similar assets on Arbitrum and Avalanche and considering the differences between the deployments, we conclude that the provided parameters are still conservative and can be further increased toward an optimized state in future iterations.\n\n### Liquidity and Position Analysis:\n\n**USDC**\n\nUSDC is mainly used as collateral for blue chip, high liquidity assets, most of which are WETH ($9M borrowed against USDC collateral) and recursive USDC borrowing. It is currently possible to liquidate USDC to cover all open USDC-WETH positions with very low slippage.\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-22 at 16.12.56.jpg](ipfs://bafkreid6lzxnhx7x2wbqlvjv3jo4wao5oybqa2iisoukfzddjjg36qem7y)\n*Source: [Chaos Risk Dashboard](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/ccar/assets/USDC-Ethereum)*\n\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-02-22 at 16.18.02 (1).png](ipfs://bafkreie223fje7qt6xvubbe65qgalwnjdzlf4jjggyqhrsdi75rhznunky)\n*Source: [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/simple/swap/USDC/WETH)*\n\n**DAI**\n\nDAI is mainly used as collateral for blue chip, high liquidity assets, most of which are WETH ($340K borrowed against DAI collateral) and USDC ($240K borrowed against DAI collateral).

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. \n\nIn addition, this ARC proposes adjusting two (2) total risk parameters, including LTV and Liquidation Threshold, across one (1) Aave Arc (Fireblocks) asset.\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Following the recent market crash, our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for LINK and WETH.** \n\nThese parameter updates also represent Gauntlet's first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HQ5c5T0.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Sr4q4Mh.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/I90tK6y.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top LINK non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zx0G68o.png)\n\n**Top WBTC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yAclipo.png)\n\n**Top WETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/r7KX1HS.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nOur recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. \n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| LINK Loan To Value     | 70%     | 67%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 5.0%     |\n| **LINK Liquidation Threshold**     | 78%     | ***75%***     |\n| WBTC Loan To Value     | 70%     | 69%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 76%     |\n| WETH Loan To Value     | 82.5%     | 81%     |\n| WETH Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |\n| **WETH Liquidation Threshold**     | 85%     | ***83%***     |\n\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 05/13 to 05/26. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 05-26 Volatility| 05-13 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| LINK   | \t  1.560317105       |  1.407103695  | \t0.15321341   |  -67.2106437    |\n| WBTC    |  \t0.855923268     |   0.823403106    | \t0.032520162    |  -64.0842057 |\n| WETH    |   0.90963415     |  0.832421096      | 0.077213054  |  \t-69.59337  |\n\n## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification\n\nOur simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| USDC Loan To Value     | 85.5%     | 87.5%     |\n| USDC Liquidation Threshold     | 88%     | 90%     |\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vdil33O.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-05-31\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",
