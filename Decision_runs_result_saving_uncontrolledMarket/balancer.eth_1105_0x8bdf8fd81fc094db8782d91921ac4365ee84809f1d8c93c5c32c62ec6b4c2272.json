        "body": "## Karpatkey Balancer Treasury CU Proposal\n\n## Background\n\nThis is a proposal to provide limited delegation of the Balancer treasury to [Karpatkey DAO](http://www.karpatkey.com) in a non-custodial, trust-minimised way.\n\nKarpatkey is a DeFi native DAO that has been constantly evolving to maximise capital efficiency, manage risk, increase security and optimise yield by combining industry-leading research with best-in-class tooling to prevent collateral liquidation. \n\nOur operation would be completely transparent at all times, and any member of Balancer DAO would be able to monitor it on-chain and through the weekly reports posted on the Balancer Forum. \\\nAlso, Karpatkey would suggest the creation of a Treasury Core Unit (CU) within Balancer DAO. If Balancer DAO approves this initiative, we would hire full time contributors to work exclusively with Balancer under our guidance and training. The scope of the CU would be determined after the assessment meetings where Karpatkey would find out Balancer’s needs. \\\nKarpatkey has been supporting Balancer since 2020, by being a top liquidity provider of ETH and stablecoins, and participating in governance, successfuly proposing a [GNO-BAL treasury swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/2110).\n\nAs a token of our long term commitment and financial alignment with Balancer, the performance fee (detailed below) would be charged in BAL and vested for 1 year. We intend to _hodl_ the collected BAL, and we would transparently report on our BAL holdings.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn order to focus on its core business, Balancer DAO must secure enough runway to keep developing its market-leading products, regardless of economic junctures. \\\nAn idle fund has a significant opportunity cost (e.g.: circa USD 120,000 a month for a $20M treasury at current market values). Therefore, delegating limited access of the treasury to a specialised DAO such as Karpatkey would optimise its growth through carefully curated and tailored strategies within a risk-controlled framework.\n\nThe chart below shows our past performance managing the treasury of our main user, GnosisDAO, when the main goal was to obtain a sustainable growth of funds with a low exposure to risk, before the focus was shifted to maximising the growth of the Gnosis Chain. As the chart illustrates, the yield obtained by Karpatkey’s strategies was greater than the yield of all the other DAOs in the ecosystem put together.\n\n![Karpatkey Participation Chart.jpg](ipfs://QmYtznUJRj7REvMnV2KgodwEiRTBDNB2b5mwLbgvBVRPgM)\nSource: [Autonolas](https://twitter.com/autonolas/status/1521853164638523397) independent research (link to original report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-3jTC3ycJYr2NzRFWeoQf4kb0EO2uMq/view))\n\n## Core Proposal\n### Trust-Minimised Fund Allocation Strategy\n\nThe process of fund allocation starts by Karpatkey DAO proposing a list of allowed protocols on Balancer DAO Snapshot, which must be approved by the majority of token holders. Once this happens, the target addresses and transactions’ call data associated with such protocols will be allowlisted in a smart contract, so that funds are always under Balancer DAO’s custody. As a result, Balancer DAO will have the power to withdraw or transfer funds without Karpatkey’s intervention.\n\nIf Balancer DAO has a specific need which wasn’t included in the approved strategy, such as incentives/rewards, payments, etc., Karpatkey would post another ad-hoc strategy including the additional services for Balancer DAO to approve. \\\nAn alternative would be to operate with trusted signers from Balancer, using the Safe multisignature wallet. Karpatkey would not hold enough signatures to be able to execute transactions on its own. Therefore, approval from Balancer signers would always be necessary.\n\nWe would put together a periodically reviewed emergency withdrawal protocol to be able to quickly derisk/liquidate/swap all positions in the event of a market crash, hack or any fortuitous event that requires to stop loss.\n\nKarpatkey DAO’s professional treasury development consists of carrying out tailored strategies that vary twice a week, adjusting to the constantly changing DeFi market.\n\n#### Daily Strategy Reevaluation \n\nEach step of the strategies would be designed and monitored daily by our research team, keeping in mind different risks and opportunities. \n\n#### Impermanent/Divergence Loss\n\nTo minimise the risk of Impermanent or Divergence Loss, we carry out the following tasks:\n\n* Identification of profitable and low IL pools (assessment of assets’ correlation evolution)\n* Definition of thresholds for exit strategies\n* Accurate IL tracking*, also considering different variations of deposited volumes  over time.\n\n*The way in which we calculate IL differs across protocols and specific cases within protocols, but it’s primordially based on the formula detailed below, which calculates the IL per LP token for any AMM with constant swap fees. Our Financial Engineering team is currently preparing a paper on  the equations that we use for IL calculation in different cases, encompassing single isolated financial positions and more complex positions including composability.\n\n### \n\n![IL Calculation.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifdeefejl4myrzqld2nzykkhg3yk6q2xrfwprumipk73hnz2r3ztq)\n\nImpermanent loss evolution tracking example:\n \n![IL Evolution.jpg](ipfs://bafkreihklmyqpr7qb72cct2it4jdvb442kvfjrcwd3o36gke33xhewzq5u)\n\n### Treasury Core Unit\n\nAfter reviewing Balancer DAO’s structure, we came to the conclusion that creating a Treasury Core Unit (CU) would increase the efficiency of the overall management of the tokens held in the treasury. If Balancer DAO agrees, this CU would be composed by full time contributors that would be sourced and recruited with Karpatkey DAO’s support. \\\nThe CU members would be trained and assisted by Karpatkey DAO, observing strict security standards. They could be on Karpatkey DAO’s payroll and would be in charge of the following tasks (among others):\n\n\n\n* **Balancer Value Proposition:** Improve the value proposition of Balancer and the Balancer DAO treasury\n* **Availability:** Increase Balancer availability on other networks and markets\n* **Liquidity:** Increasing Balancer liquidity so more traders and investors can acquire it with a lower price impact\n* **Balancer Health Monitoring:** Propose buybacks if we consider Balancer is undervalued\n* **Fund Proposals:** Any proposal involving funding will be comprehensively analysed by the CU to plan how token transfers should take place in a timeline, and ensure that liquidity requirements are met and executed properly\n* **Fund OPEX:** All of Balancer DAO’s operating expenses will be analysed and projected to meet liquidity requirements and make timely transfers if needed\n* **Drafting and Maintenance of an Emergency Token Withdrawal Protocol:** In case of a sudden black swan market event, the team will execute a carefully structured protocol to de-risk all positions and avoid losing funds. This protocol will be periodically updated to ensure it’s ready to be executed at all times\n* **Capital Optimisation:** CDPs will be continuously monitored and managed to prevent liquidation (more details in the Risk Management section below)\n* **Reporting:** Dashboard creation and maintenance to monitor the yield of investments, rewards distribution and overall treasury growth trend, health and diversification\n* **Bridge Monitoring:** analysis of funds allocation to allow the Balancer token to be transferred across networks without friction.\n\n### Yield Strategy\n\nThe yield strategy would vary weekly to keep it within target. It would resort to different combinations of staking derivatives solutions, AMM, same asset leveraged in money markets, carry trade, arbitrages, etc. Given the risk that it entails, we don’t do trading.\n\nIn alignment with Balancer’s treasury allocation policy, the strategy would not extract  value from directly competing protocols. The following protocols would be considered to obtain an adequately diversified yield strategy with low risk and reduced ETH price exposure. This is just a sample list, the final one would follow Balancer DAO’s preferences and risk profile:\n\nAave, Agave, Ankr, Aura, Balancer, Bancor, Compound, Element, Honeyswap, Idle, Lido, Liquity, Maker, Nexus Mutual, QiDAO, Reflexer, Rocket pool, Stakewise, Sushiswap, Swapr, Symmetric, Synthetix, Uniswap, Unit.\n\n### Reporting\n\nKarpatkey DAO will post a weekly treasury development report on the Balancer forum, and support in identifying data elements upon request from the Balancer community. Also, Karpatkey DAO would review data reported and assist in performing analytics and quality reviews to confirm the accuracy of the information.\n\nThe following metrics would be included:\n\n* **Portfolio Summary:** shows the current holdings in USD and ETH equivalent, considering the allocation by blockchain, as well as the allocation of the most relevant assets\n* **Revenues:** shows the performance of the portfolio strategy, displaying the current APR, annual revenues, capital utilisation and past performance\n* **Positions:** shows the complete strategy implemented for the considered time period, explaining the type of investments, protocols, underlying assets, expected APR and expected revenues\n* **Loans Management:** shows the loan strategy to quickly assess the health status of the active loans, considering the borrowed assets and funds, the lent assets and funds, the collateral ratio and the minimum (liquidation) collateral ratio\n* **Portfolio details:** shows the complete composition of the portfolio by type of asset\n* **Improvement Proposals:** shows the list of executed proposals, as well as a summary of the weight of each proposal\n* **Incentives program:** shows the incentives strategy, displaying the amount of assets used on each protocol.\n\n### Fees\n\nKarpatkey DAO will charge the following fees, which have been adjusted to make this proposal self-financing, without burdening Balancer DAO’s growth:\n\n#### Management fee\n\nA yearly management fee (in monthly instalments) of 0.5% of the AUM would be charged to finance fixed costs like hiring full time contributors to Balancer DAO.\n\n#### Performance fee\n\nWe’d charge a monthly performance fee of 20% of the yield obtained during the last month in BAL tokens, and every payment will have a vesting period of 1 year. We intend to hold it long term, as a token of our commitment to Balancer.\n\n### Termination\n\nBalancer may terminate Karpatkey DAO’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of Governance Mechanism. Kapatkey DAO may terminate this agreement upon four week’s notice posted as a new discussion thread in the Balancer forum. In case the termination is requested by Balancer without at least a 4 week notice, Karpatkey DAO will be granted an exit fee equal to the fees collected during the last 2 months, which will be paid in ETH. Regular fees will be collected until the day of termination.\n\n\n### Custody of Funds\n\nKarpatkey DAO is not a custodian of funds. The funds will be in possession of authorised signers of Balancer at all times. Karpatkey DAO will sign transactions using two addresses, which won’t suffice to execute transactions.\n\nKarpatkey DAO is not responsible for the loss of funds caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies with smart contracts or protocols which are not owned by Balancer or Karpatkey DAO.\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion by Balancer and may need to be (re)structured to take account of legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, Karpatkey DAO would post a yield strategy in Balancer’s Snapshot, holding a broad list of protocol options without granular specification of parameters nor exact moment when transactions would be executed. We would then operate within those boundaries, without having to go through a DAO-wide vote on every trade, while ensuring that only transactions approved by Balancer DAO could be carried out by Karpatkey DAO. \\\nAlternatively, at least one trusted signer should be appointed by Balancer to approve each transaction. This could be a member of the Treasury Core Unit.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Risk Management\n\nEvery decision made and action taken weighs in risk exposure. Most large treasury holders have one thing in common: risk aversion. At Karpatkey DAO, we go above and beyond standard risk assessment protocols, and we have developed a multilevel approach to curate yield strategies, assess protocols and carry out transactions safely.\n\n(see the full list of risk factors in the forum post due to max char. limit for Snapshot)",

Recognized as key contributors and the vital link between partners and the protocol, our dedication to the DAO is unwavering. As we embark on another quarter, our commitment is not just to continue, but to evolve – to redefine our engagement and amplify our positive impact on the DAO in 2024.\n\nThe third quarter marked a significant transition for the Maxis. Following the departure of our strategic visionary, Solarcurve, we embraced change and innovation. Tritium rose to the occasion, leading critical initiatives like the [core pool incentive automation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-457-core-pool-incentive-program-automation/5254), as well as securing and executing on the Arbitrum STIP, demonstrating our adaptability and resilience.\n\nOur evolution goes beyond roles and responsibilities. The Maxis are transforming from a collective of passionate enthusiasts to a team of full-time, professional experts. The new full-time addition consists of @Xeonus who will spearhead our strategic direction.\n\nOur mindful approach to funding allocation ensures an efficient use of resources – balancing USDC and BAL demands with maximum effectiveness. Our focus is not just on growth but on impact and transparency.\n\nIn 2024 we want to make the most impact by driving forward exciting initiatives while providing excellent mission-critical services to the DAO. We have identified four main (non-v3 dependent) initiatives to channel our efforts, while continuing to provide the core services that have been the backbone of the DAO for over two years.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nBeyond regular operations, the Maxi’s are focused on trying to create successful narratives in the Balancer ecosystem through various focused initiatives. In 2024, we strive to focus on a few of them, ensure that our focus areas have a clear leader/champion and some defined goals and that time and resources are available to focus on these topics. The impact of those topics is directly related to the achieved objectives.\n\n### Initiative 1: Growth beyond Mainnet\n\nLead: Tritium\n\nTeam: Shakotan (tech and operations), Xenous (data)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Grants Committee, Beethoven (Marketing + Beets grants)\n\nSummary\n\nThe initiative aims to further strengthen the DAO's presence beyond mainnet, focusing on Arbitrum, zkEVM, and Gnosis. The initiative emphasizes the successful execution of the Arbitrum STIP, but most of all development of strong competencies in creating data-driven narrative showcasing Balancer’s competitiveness, and collaboration with key blockchain partners such as Polygon and Aribtrum. The strategy includes adaptability to pivot based on market trends and performance metrics and an ever growing understanding of the KPIs that our grant providing partners care about.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Timely STIP Execution: Ensure punctual and successful delivery of the current STIP, including consistent reporting and active engagement with the DAO.\n2. Data Narrative Development: Work to build a competency within Balancer to tell stories about how we are using our emissions to drive growth for our protocol and in the ecosystems we exist in.\n\n  1. We should be able to put out velodrome style reports that tell our story.\n\n3. KPI-Focused Program Management: Stay close to various grant programs and look at successful grant recipients to understand the KPIs they set and how they achieve them.\n\n  1. Propose changes at Balancer to make this possible or point out why we are not well suited to meet the kinds of KPIs that chain ecosystems see value in.\n\n4. Next Grant Cycle Preparation: Identify potential grant sources for the upcoming cycle and strategize engagement.\n5. Feedback Integration: Actively seek and incorporate feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the initiative.\n6. STIP Comparative Analysis: Collaborate with the STIP body to assess and report on Balancer's performance in comparison to peers.\n7. Impact Report Creation: Develop a comprehensive report detailing the impact of extra incentives delivered through balancer on L2 ecosystems.\n8. Strategic Partnerships: Strengthen collaborations with Gnosis Chain, Base, Arbitrum and Polygon to share successes and apply learnings, particularly in the context of zkEVM scaling.\n9. Collaborate with Beets as much as possible to create a shared competency here.\n\n### Initiative 2: Redesign of the Gauge Framework v1\n\nLead: Xeonus\n\nTeam: Shakotan (building automation), Tritium, Zekraken, Zen Dragon and Mike B (design)\n\nSummary\n\nThis initiative aims to introduce an automated, dynamic system for evaluating and adjusting gauge emissions based on performance metrics. This new framework is designed to efficiently allocate BAL rewards, optimizing support for both high-cap and emerging projects. The goal is to ensure a more responsive and adaptable system that balances revenue optimization with nurturing potential future revenue generators.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Automated Gauge Evaluation: Develop a system for automatic assessment of gauges based on predefined metrics.\n2. Dynamic Emission Cap Adjustments: Implement a mechanism to adjust emission caps (ranging from 2% to 10%) based on gauge performance, potentially reducing underperforming gauges to a certain cap (e.g. 0.5%).\n3. Adaptive Framework: Ensure the framework is responsive to market dynamics and capital efficiency, allowing for more flexible and efficient allocation of BAL rewards.\n4. Rules around Duplication: Rules for handling the same Token in multiple pools/chains or the same DAO with multiple tokens.\n\n### Initiative 3: Support Balancer v3 Design\n\nLead: Mike B\n\nTeam: Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Tritium, Shakotan(tech and automation)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs, Beethoven (Tech)\n\nSummary: Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It's crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n2. Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings like TWAMMs, boosted pools, and dynamic ECLPs, and effectively pitch these to ecosystem projects.\n3. Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n4. Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n5. Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n### Initiative 4: Automation ownership transfer & on-chain automation improvements\n\nLead: Shakotan\n\nTeam: Tritium\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs\n\nSummary:\n\nOngoing automation for both on-chain and off-chain processes. Improving existing operational contracts, such as Gauge injector and improving Defender codebase so it becomes maintainable.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. OZ Defender automation takeover from Balancer Labs and Markus\n2. Full tech and development for on-chain tasks\n3. ChildGaugeInjector version 2 release with new features + factory deployment to support better events and data used by Data Team\n4. Potential fees-handler-sc implementation to reduce rugability of the fees bags + improve data flow.\n\nService Provider Name & Overview: Balancer Maxis\n\nLeader(s): Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Danko, Tritium, Shakotan and Gosuto\n\nContributors (a.k.a.

Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q1 2024 would cost around 0.9% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.3M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.5% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~10%.\n\nFurthermore, this table provides an overview of the last years impact putting this proposal into perspective:\n\n|Year|Quarter|BAL|BAL Price|USDC|ETH|ETH price|Operations cost|People cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|2023|Q1|48000|$6|$0.00|0|1201|0|$266,400|$266,400.00|\n|2023|Q2|42150|$7|$0.00|5|1795|8975|$291,257|$300,231.50|\n|2023|Q3|26025|$5|$132,630.00|20|1853|37060|$251,825|$288,884.50|\n|2023|Q4|31695|$3|$168,770.00|20|1652|33040|$271,779|$304,819|\n|2024|Q1|35718|$4|$108,095.00|20|2170|43400|$250,969|$294,369|\n\nAlthough the Maxis will have around 1 FTE more manpower at their disposal, the impact on the treasury stays nearly the same. Maxis have undergone internal optimizations in pay to reduce the impact on the DAOs USDC as much as possible given the current market conditions. In that regard, 49.5% of requested funding will be locked in our stkauraBAL vesting contract. We will also roll over $37,720.00 in savings from our Q3 and Q4 budget (bizdev, bounties etc.) and deduct that amount from the current proposal, which further reduced our overall demand for USDC.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\nLink to SLA (if going through the Foundation): N/A\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `108095` USDC as `108095000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `35718` as `35718000000000000000000`\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with WETH `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` by writing `deposit` with amount `20` to wrap the required ETH.

This strategic shift has not only enhanced efficiency but also significantly reduced operational costs over the last 6 months.  \nBuilding on this success, we are requesting an optimized funding package for Q2-Q3 2025 to continue delivering exceptional service and support, while showcasing Balancer's commitment to innovation. This proposal requests funding the Balancer Maxis SP for the upcoming 6 months from Q2 to Q3 of 2025.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nWe propose to work on 3 key initiatives that fully align the DAOs goals of becoming an efficient, profitable, innovative and builder friendly DEX. Looking back at our previous funding [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-694-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q4-2024-to-q1-2025/5991/5), we want to continue with improving on-chain automation and operations as we still see great potential in simplifying processes within the DAO. Additionally, partner management and advising product development go hand-in-hand as we are at the forefront of managing DAO interfacing requests and innovation. Based on these focus points, we propose following initiatives:\n\n### Initiative 1: On-chain Operations and Security Management (DevSecOps)\n\n**Co-Leads**: @Xeonus & @gosuto  \n**Team**: jalbrekt  \n**Summary**  \nWe have made significant improvements of on-chain operations, such as nearly hands-off automation of fee processing for Balancer v2, interruption free automation of BAL reward distribution as well as significantly simplifying the partner onboarding experience. We want to continue to improve and automate as many aspects of our infrastructure and fee processing as possible while also advising on on-chain security. The next natural iteration is the transformation from DevOps to Dev**Sec**Ops with support from Hypernative and Balancer Labs:\n\n* On-chain operations and monitoring  \n* Self-service modules and management (Ops UI)  \n* Automated Fee processing  \n* Treasury multi-sig management oversight and execution in collaboration with @kpk   \n* Leading of a newly formed security council of ecosystem participants\n\n#### Objectives\n\n1. **Manage and Operate Balancer deployments (v2 and v3) across chains**  \n   1. Ensure that proxy infrastructure such as Chainlink automation works  \n   2. Modify and expand Openzeppelin functionality if BAL is launched on a new chain  \n2. **Manage and Operate on-chain permissions and protocol states**  \n   1. Management and execution of operations permission BIPs  \n   2. Overseeing protocol health and   \n3. **Manage and Operate DAO wallets incl. Treasury assets in collaboration with karpatkey**  \n   1. vlAURA token management and evaluation of potential migration to a dedicated safe wallet incl. Activation of the recently reviewed safe module to automate relocking ([BIP-715](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-715-enable-automatic-aura-relocking/6077))  \n   2. Advising on building and execution of payloads for buffer management for the Karpatkey managed positions  \n   3. Regular sync points and alignment with @kpk on treasury management and optimization, including but not limited to permission granting and security impact of DAO funds  \n   4. Building of automation to propose / transmit transactions directly to a Safe after a pull-request in our operations repository has been reviewed / approved and merged (pilot already in production with vlAURA voting)  \n4. **Secondary Reward Token Management and Distribution**  \n   1. Operations UI  \n   2. Merkl rewards on v3  \n   3. Injector v2 infrastructure  \n5. **Maintenance and expansion of Operations UI functionality**  \n   1. Improve our current partner onboarding experience  \n   2. Expand injector v2 infrastructure functionality  \n   3. Take learnings and further improve and expand components based on partner feedback  \n   4. Advise BLabs on any potential partner onboarding UI experience in the main app  \n6. **Oversight and advisory of the internal security committee council**  \n   1. Overseeing chain state and management of the Emergency DAO multisig together with BLabs  \n   2. Liaison for on-chain security topics between Hypernative, BLabs and Maxis on-chain operations  \n   3. Monitoring and improvement of security measures to prevent malicious transaction execution on any of our multi-sigs  \n7. **Omni-chain operations: Chainlink Automation & Gas Stations**  \n   1. Further optimize Chainlink upkeep monitoring and automate LINK top-ups as well as the design and development of backup systems  \n   2. Incorporate more monitoring solutions into the [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/chainlink-automation)  \n   3. Establish omni-chain gas station contracts to feed all relevant dependencies with ETH (or chain gas tokens) and LINK (gas for automation jobs)  \n8. **Fee processing and distribution**  \n   1. Own and execute on fee processing for all Balancer v3 deployments Balancer controls  \n   2. Oversee and execute on fee processing on Balancer v2, incl. Maintenance and improvements to our newly deployed protocol fee allocator v2 code-base ([see GitHub repo](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator_v2))\n\n### Initiative 2: Growth\n\n**Co-Leads**: @ZenDragon & @Mike_B  \n**Team**: @zekraken  \n**Summary**  \nThe Balancer Maxis core focus has developed to include operational excellence, growth, and partner experience.  As partners are onboarding into the Balancer ecosystem, the Maxis are tasked with streamlining the process and providing an enjoyable customer experience to retain as many users as possible. The end goal of the growth team is to simplify the process of onboarding and leveraging Balancer’s tech. We are dedicated to growing the product offerings Balancer has to meet market needs, communicating this to partners and the greater market, and finally utilizing these dominant products to grow the revenue and value proposition of the protocol.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. **Growth of Balancer V3** over the next 6 months to attain at a minimum 300M USD in TVL. The current growth trajectory points towards higher expectations, but linearly 300M over 6 months represents the current growth pace. This goal sets a realistic target which the Balancer Service Providers will aim to fulfill. While not in ETH terms, our DAO costs are denominated in USDC primarily so for now TVL goals will be as well.  \n2. **Driving the DAO towards cash flow positive** in terms of revenue taken to the DAO vs. costs of service providers. The DAO team composition is quite lean at this point, so our only option is to drive revenue into Balancer across the board to make this possible. Partnerships will do so via bringing in new business with the BDSP through structured configuration of pools, hooks, and incentive optimizations as needed.  \n   1. The definitive target is ⅓ of Balancer revenue or more to come from Balancer V3 by the end of this 6 month window. Due to large legacy pools such as Aave/wstETH and stickiness on V2, this is a fair target.  \n3. **Owning the market to product development feedback loop** lands on partnerships to relay what products are needed in order to drive further growth. This is demonstrated by the StableSurge hook’s recent success and the ability to understand partner needs becoming a tangible solution which increases business outcomes.  \n   1. Over the next 6 months the goal is to have new unique products launched on Balancer V3 attain over 50M in TVL. Including hooks such as StableSurge, MEV Capture, and any new invariants built in house by the Balancer Labs team.  \n   2. In addition, at least one new product deployed must be credited to this feedback loop process and an article on the initial demand to the deployment and go to market will be presented in the last month of this engagement.   \n4. **Grow ecosystem and governance participation** by onboarding 3 additional DAOs or entities to participate in the veBAL system at some capacity. This is to occur over the next 6 months and will include sparking renewed participation from any existing DAOs such as Gnosis or Aave. The goal is advancing the narrative around Balancer and aligning partners with the ecosystem.  \n5. **Streamlining and Transforming Partner Experience.** In tandem with the above initiatives led by @Xeonus and @gosuto to automate processes regarding reward distribution, payload creation, reviews, and partners interacting with front-end tools the goal is to have as hands off a process from pool creation to gauge proposal as possible. Historically Balancer SP’s have provided a “white glove” onboarding service to partners, which will continue, but in a different capacity. The tools in place will be utilized for partners to handle the entire process of onboarding in the majority of new prospects. During this time the partner management team will continue to assist, and drive feedback to the DevOps team to reach the final form of a 100% partner owned onboarding experience.   \n   1. This applies to pool, gauge, and injector creation with only minor necessity for hook configuration, amplification parameter changers, add_reward, and injector assistance in the cases where only governance or the Maxis have the ability to change an outcome.  \n   2. Furthermore reducing rate provider review lead time to a 2 week maximum in even the busiest of times is an attainable goal by coordinating with partners, the internal priorities of Balancer Labs reviewers, and the expected expansions to new chains + new lending markets for boosted pools.  \n   3. Longer term additional items can be covered such as a more streamlined token whitelisting process, providing images for tokens where they don’t exist on coingecko, and management of metadata related to how pools display in the front end (ex. pool summary, pool naming, points system, etc.)  \n6. **Driving development on Balancer V3.**  Coordinate with external teams to drive development of innovative AMM based products on Balancer V3.  This includes but is not limited to teams like QuantAMM, CoWAMM, Akronswap, EZKL, and others. In order to make Balancer V3 a thriving ecosystem of innovative AMM tech, we must seek out and work to build novel AMM innovation both internally and externally.    \n   1. Identifying promising AMM teams to join the Balancer ecosystem  \n   2. Assist with the development process, coordinate technical meetings, structure go to market strategies, and align on objectives.    \n      1. Over the next 6 months, launch at least 2 externally built AMMs on top of Balancer v3  \n   3. Brainstorm and execute on internally built innovations in the AMM space  \n      1. Readjusting CLAMM  \n      2. MEV capturing technologies  \n      3. Dynamic fee methodologies  \n      4. Oracle based AMMs  \n   4. Work with the integrations team to ensure trades route through innovative new pool types  \n   5. Expand pool offerings to cover a wider range of assets classes such as  \n      1. RWAs  \n      2. Volatile long and short tail pairs  \n      3. New token launches\n\nThe goal of the above initiatives is to expand Balancer V3 market share in the volatile asset market, of which we are currently underrepresented.    \n\t\n\n### Initiative 3: Interfacing with Product Development\n\n**Co-Leads**: @ZenDragon & @Xeonus  \n**Team**: @zekraken  \n**Summary**  \nThe Balancer Maxis have the unique position to have direct interaction with strategic partners while also running protocol operations. Therefore, we want to leverage this position to aid BLabs in developing and improving our product suite. Additionally, we aim to experiment with tooling or pilot projects to showcase the power of Balancer v3. Our intention is to focus on 3-4 strategic objectives and report their outcome in our monthly updates\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Integration and functional testing**  \n   1. Partner with smart contracts team to perform user testing, provide feedback, and provide additional requirements if necessary during build phase  \n   2. Perform data analysis and make adjustment to parameters if necessary for new pool types or other new functionality such as hooks  \n   3. Build additional tooling such as the MEV arb bot which allows immediate trade flow through pools before aggregators and/or other bots can integrate. Also seek to bring additional volume to Balancer. Share and teach tooling to any partners if required.  \n2. **Analytics experience**  \n   1. Interface with the OpCo design and BLabs data teams to build a native Zen UI analytics experience based on Dune and Subgraph data  \n   2. Advise the backend team how to integrate key metrics into api-v3  \n3. **veBAL experience**  \n   1. The veBAL voting page has been the last component that needs to be migrated to the Zen UI. We will consult the front-end team in product development execution which includes: testing, optimizing and interfacing with voting incentive market providers, Testing and executing on new voting strategies incl. A veBAL multi-voter module similar to our DeFilytica prototype that has been in production for a while.  \n   2. Improve UX around veBAL management such as voting, veBAL power and vote delegation  \n4. **Hook ideation and execution**  \n   1. @ZenDragon stable surge hook is already gaining a lot of positive traction for the protocol. We want to further explore hook ideas based on partner feedback and be involved in prototyping potential ideas with BLabs.\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented, gosuto, Zen Dragon, Zekraken and jalbrekt\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers**: -\n\n**Pledge to abide by [BIP-702](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-702-balancer-dao-service-providers-and-grantee-standards/5998) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards**: Yes** \n\n**Domains of Operation**:\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations  \n* Partner Management and Business Development  \n* On-Chain Development, Security and Operations (DevSecOps)  \n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination  \n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline**:\n\n1. **Governance and Protocol Operations**\n\n* Leading governance procedures, ensuring their execution and integrity.  \n* Facilitating technical discussions within governance scopes.  \n* Setting up governance votes and reviewing payloads for DAO transactions.  \n* Crafting detailed governance proposals and specifications.  \n* Offering deep technological insights during governance deliberations.  \n* Assisting in specifications to proposals for proper payload execution  \n* Infrastructure and tool creation for enhancing governance operations.  \n* Automating tasks, reducing human dependency in governance functions.  \n* Creating UI tools that support operational tasks (past examples: pool creation, reward injectors, linear pool deployment)\n\n**2.

Consult our monthly updates for progress [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/service-provider/balancer-maxis/18). To ensure full transparency on our working objectives, achievements and cost basis, we will update the ecosystem and community participants regularly through weekly meetings and monthly community reports:  \n**Ecosystem Meetings**\n\n* Inform ecosystem participants of our weekly progress and planned activities  \n* Coordinate collaborations and issues with other ecosystem stakeholders\n\n**Monthly reports**\n\n* Write up detailed monthly reports on key objectives  \n* Provide a financial statement of the usage of discretionary funds as in previous funding rounds\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:** \n\nThe Maxis have established a conservative and effective budgeting framework with a mix of fixed contributor salaries and flexible discretionary budgeting. Over the last year, Maxis have requested a large discretionary budget of $15k USDC a month. Based on our experience from the last 2 funding rounds, and our new team composition, we concluded that we will not need such high discretionary funds anymore. As a result, we will reduce the monthly ask of this position to $5k a month (from $15k a month).  \nAdditionally, based on our conservative spending framework, we can carry over significant savings of 75,000USDC that will be deducted further reducing our overall funding request.  \nGiven we are also taking over BD for the DAO our total FTEs will slightly increase from 5 to 5.25 while keeping the average cost basis per FTE roughly the same (see [previous funding request](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-694-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q4-2024-to-q1-2025/5991)).\n\nA detailed breakdown of our funding request with cost breakdown is visualized below:  \n![maxis_q2q3_1.png](ipfs://bafkreifppktx3upxmysc6djfioe45yeomjtxexmvx5p7j4k66miew3rj3a)\n\nWe are additionally asking for a BAL token grant of 37,500 BAL for the next half-year (at BAL price of $1.4). BAL will be locked for 1 year with a custom vesting contract.  \nQuarterly BAL allocation: $23,437 ( = 18,750 BAL)\n\nIn total our USDC and BAL cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 5.25 FTE:\n\n| Position | Cost Basis |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| $ / FTE / month (USDC + BAL vest) | $13,571.4 |\n| $ / FTE / month (USDC) | $11,904,7 |\n| Discretionary monthly allocation | $5,000 |\n\n### Optimized cost footprint compared to previous funding proposals (Maxis & BDSP)\n\n| Position | Maxis: Prev. Proposal | BDSP Prev. Proposal | Maxis: Actual proposal | Savings |\n| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| People cost ($) | $334,500.00 | $72,000.00 | $375,000.00 | $31,500.00 |\n| BAL Token Grant ($) | $61,874.82 | $12,000.00 | $52,500.00 | $21,374.82 |\n| Discretionary | $90,000.00 | $0.00 | $30,000.00 | $60,000.00 |\n\nThis results in a total reduction of our bi-annual footprint by $112,874 or $225,749 annually attributed to a reduced head-count (for Maxis and BDSP combined) and reduced ask in discretionary funds.  \nWith the additional savings of $75,000 from the last funding round **we get a total of $300,749 in savings until end of Q3**\n\n### Personnel Changes\n\nWith our new focus on on-chain operations, security, BD and partner management, we will further optimize our team-composition. As a result, @MikeB and @zekraken will aid @ZenDragon in BD efforts.@zekraken will increase his part-time contributor role to nearly full-time (0.75 FTE). Jalbrekt is now fully onboarded as a part-time contributor and signer and will continue to work as a part-time contributor. This new team composition will guarantee the most optimal cost basis and efficiency for the DAO in terms of Ops and BD deliverables.\n\n**Length of engagement**: 6 months  \n**Budget:** 330,000 USDC and 37,500 BAL\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` \n\n**Impact on the Treasury**\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently approximately hold 3,392,654 BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for the next half year would impact 0.55% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 1.11% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 4.804mln in stables (excluding stables in v3 buffers). Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3.43% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 13.7%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `330000` USDC as `330000000000`\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `37500` as `37500000000000000000000`\n\nEdits by Maxis:\n* revised Ops and Growth Proposal",

        "author": "0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17",
        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1354\n\n# Introduction\n\nOver the last 6 months, the Maxis have transformed into a professional on-chain DevOps team, ensuring smooth operations of Balancer technology across chains as well as providing white-glove service to partners in the ecosystem. Our key success metrics are showcased by fast response times to partner requests and successful execution of many initiatives like supporting the launch of CoWAMM, the related incentive program, or the design and execution of token grants. Furthermore, we are constantly improving our technology stack with the ultimate goal of achieving self-service autonomy for most operations.\n\nGiven the Maxis are an integral part of Balancer technology and partner management, we aim to switch to bi-annual funding starting in Q4 2024. This provides us with more funding stability and also guarantees that resources for the upcoming Balancer v3 launch will be adequately allocated.\n\n# Initiatives\n\nAs with previous funding proposals, we want to make the most impact to Balancer DAO by working on key initiatives with clearly measurable objectives.\n\nAs context, you can refer to our last quarters performance reports to evaluate our progress in relation to initiatives executed in Q3 2024 ([July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-july-2024/5907), [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-august-2024/5979), reports)\n\n## Initiative 1: Scale Balancer’s On-Chain DevOps Hub\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver the last 6 months, we have taken over responsibility over most of the on-chain operations tech stack, including multi-sig management, OpenZepellin infrastructure to distribute BAL rewards, secondary incentive management as well as new chain deployments and access management.\n\nOur main focus for the next half year is to simplify and further automate any on-chain operations that the DAO has to manage. These include but are not limited to new AMM management (e.g. CoWAMMs), Balancer v3 and its corresponding new fee sweeping mechanism as well as governance operations. Two components will be crucial to drive this initiative forward: our [automation code base](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis) and our [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/).\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Operate and maintain new chain deployments for Balancer v2\n\n* Support custom infrastructure for the Balancer v2 MODE deployment incl. a dedicated MODE ve8020 gauge system on MODE network.\n* Support and integrate potential new chain deployments into our operations infrastructure such as BAL token emission scheduling through OpenZeppelin\n* Deploy and maintain any needed infrastructure to operate those chains\n\n2. Fee processing for Balancer v2\n\n* Coordinate and run fee processing of Balancer v2’s core pool framework as long as it is operational in light of the v3 launch\n* Coordinate with Mimic fee processing\n\n3. Secondary Token reward management\n\n* Build a rewards management system on Mode as part of a veMODE initiative\n* Launch a injector configuration tool on the operations UI to further improve partner management and self-service capabilities\n\n4. AURA position management\n\n* Launch a safe module to automatically relock AURA\n* Maintain the self-service module for vote placement for the BD team and design potential automation work to assign incentives without human intervention.\n\n5. Gauges and Core Pool Framework (Balancer v2)\n\n* Continued management of core pool detection and pool list curation\n* Optimization of fee structure after transitioning our focus from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3\n\n6. Management and Execution of Token Grants\n\n* Maintaining and provisioning of upcoming token distribution grants\n* Advising on how to design and execute token grant programs\n\n7. Omni-chain operations: Chainlink Automation & Gas Stations\n\n* Further optimize Chainlink upkeep monitoring and automate LINK top-ups as well as the design and development of backup systems\n* Incorporate more monitoring solutions into the [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/chainlink-automation)\n* Establish omni-chain gas station contracts to feed all relevant dependencies with ETH (or chain gas tokens) and LINK (gas for automation jobs)\n* Collaborate with Chainlink to define and ship client-side cross-chain rate providers as well as advising on oracles for omni-chain operations.\n\n8. Analytics (v2)\n\n* Transition to maintenance mode for DeFilytica deployments\n\n9. Financial reporting (v2 & v3)\n\n* Advise on financial reporting metrics with karpatkey\n* Build and ship artifacts to monitor revenue generation on Balancer v3\n\n10. Operations UI\n\n* Full GitHub integration to propose changes from the UI\n* Completion of security review with Hypernative\n* Exploration of token whitelisting module\n* Building of tooling surrounding Balancer v2 and v3 management such as monitoring dashboards for Chainlink, Injector v2 configurator or the migration of legacy pool creators for Balancer v2\n\n## Initiative 2: Support and execute on the launch of Balancer v3 and new Products\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus, Tritium\n\n**Team**: Zen Dragon, gosuto, MikeB\n\n**Summary**\n\nBalancer v3 is planned to release between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. The Maxis will play a crucial role in setting up key infrastructure that guarantees correct operations of the new protocol version across chains. We will collaborate with BLabs and other ecosystem partners to plan and execute a smooth launch which will include a rollout to a defined set of target chains and the subsequent management thereafter. Additionally, we will explore new revenue models and tokenomics adjustments that will have the most beneficial impact on both partners and the DAO.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Plan and execute on v3 launch\n2. Design, deploy and maintain all key infrastructure necessary to manage Balancer v3 on-chain\n* Integration tests before launch\n* Support and build a potential testnet deployment together with Balancer labs\n* Automation\n* Permission sets and monitoring\n* Fee collection mechanisms\n\n3. Fee processing for Balancer v3\n* Design and implement a new fee collection mechanism for Balancer v3, either on-chain or off-chain. Balancer v3’s new design will allow to more easily collect fees per pool and therefore has the potential to be built completely in-house and onchain\n\n4. Support and manage deployments on strategic chains\n* Work together with the BD Unit to utilize synergies in chain deployments\n* Coordinate expansion plans with ecosystem partners\n\n5. Design and execute a liquidity seeding plan with potential bootstrapping reward programs.\n* Management and execution of secondary token reward programs to bootstrap liquidity on products build on top of Balancer v3\n\n6. Support partners and builders in execution of product launches\n* Management and monitoring of creator fees in Balancer v3\n* Work to align new pool logic with users (DAOs seeking liquidity solutions)\n* Be leaders and/or available resources in the Balancer Community and Developer Ecosystem\n\n7. Design and build new analytics artifacts together with the product and data teams\n* Explore potential deployment of a native analytics platform on the native app\n* Advise service providers on how to incorporate key metric data based on partner feedback\n\n8. Advance Tokenomics and the DAOs Revenue Strategy\n* Balancer v3 offers the opportunity to rethink the current setup of Balancer’s tokenomics. The Maxis will lead any strategic workshops or workstreams together with key stakeholders in the DAO\n* Optimize the core pool framework based on the reduced BAL emission schedule that will go into effect in Q1 2025 (according to the BAL [emission schedule](https://dune.com/balancer/bal-supply))\n\n## Initiative 3: Partner Management\n\n**Co-Leads**: MikeB, Zen Dragon\n\n**Team**: Tritium, Zekraken\n\n**Summary**\n\nBalancer’s partner pipeline has experienced substantial growth across the 10 networks we support, and this momentum is expected to continue as V3 and aligned stakeholders drive new opportunities. Our partner management team's core objective is to not only sustain but also maximize the value of relationships with both current and new partners for the benefit of the DAO and veBAL holders. To achieve this, we will collaborate closely with the business development and DevOps teams to strategically enhance the partner experience and streamline the onboarding process for new partners.

Building strong working relationships with internal partners to provide the best possible service and options to our partners.\n* Employing the advanced tech built on Balancer to provide optimal outcomes\n* ncluding Cowswap, Gyroscope, Xave, QuantAMM, hooks, boosted pools, and others as they present themselves.\n\n3. Overseeing ongoing revenue improvements to suggest to partners. I.e. swap fees, pool migrations, amplification parameters etc.\n4. Providing proactive partner support and guiding new partners through the ecosystem.\n* Governance, incentive markets, new launches and pooling opportunities.\n\n5. Rate Provider review facilitation and continuous process improvement\n6. Spearheading with the DevOps team to execute BD and partner requests not limited to, primarily related to smart contract interactions in a safe and efficient manner.\n7. Coordinating with compounders and wrappers to ensure our partners receive seamless integration to all relevant platforms. I.e. Beefy, Aura, StakeDAO.\n8. Working with various vote markets to improve partner incentive efficiencies and an agnostic approach to revenue flows through veBAL incentive platforms.\n\n### Service Provider Name & Overview: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers**: Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\nPledge to abide by [[BIP-629]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-629-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards: Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n1.

Over the last 6 months we have always been handling the discretionary portion very conservatively. In the last quarter, we only utilized approximately half of the $60k in allocated funds for Q3 2024. We will roll over ***savings from this cost point of more than $25k USDC*** and deduct them from this proposal.\n\nFurthermore, we improved our cost basis per FTE, all while we increased our headcount and capacity for the anticipated higher demand for Balancers v3 launch. Our average costs came down from an average of $13,484 $ / FTE to $13,212.50 $ / FTE (incl. BAL vests) compared to Q3 2024.\n\nA detailed breakdown of our proposed costs is visualized below:\n\n![|624x320](upload://m8DK7A5w9Ai4IkfttRSTMtu56Bs.png)\n\nWe are additionally asking for a BAL token grant of 32,738 BAL for the next half-year (at BAL price of $1.89). BAL will be locked for 1 year either as veBAL or in a veBAL wrapper such as auraBAL.\n\nQuarterly BAL allocation: $30,937.50 ( = 16,369 BAL)\n\nIn total our USDC and BAL cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 5 FTE:\n\n|Position|Cost Basis|\n| --- | --- |\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC + BAL vest)|$13,212.50|\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC)|$11,150|\n|$ / Freelance FTE / month (USDC)|$9,600|\n\n**Length of engagement: 6 months**\n\n**Budget: 398,135 USDC and 32,738 BAL**\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n**Impact on the Treasury**\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold 3,507,473 BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for the next half year would impact 0.93% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 1.87% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 5.727mln in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 6.95% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 13.9%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `398135` USDC as `398135000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `32738` as `32738000000000000000000`.",

        "body": "### [PR with Payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/335)\n\n# Service Provider Name & Overview\nDespite the dissolution of Orb Collective, the engineers of the Integrations Team desire to continue contributing to the Balancer Ecosystem. We believe that our ongoing involvement within the Ecosystem is critical in driving both the growth and widespread adoption of the Balancer Protocol in alignment with its core mission to be a platform and not a product. As such, we are seeking support and funding to establish a new, independent service provider, to be known as Three Rocks. Our goal is to continue providing valuable partner engineering services as well as continue to work towards refining and enhancing the Developer Experience of building on Balancer.\n\n# Leadership and Team\nOur organization consists of four dedicated and talented engineers: Rab, Bailey, Greg, and Mkflow. We have consciously chosen a lean team structure and focused scope of work, which we believe will allow us to operate with maximum efficiency.\n\nRab previously worked as the Head of Integrations at Orb Collective and will continue to lead the engineering team of Three Rocks. He originally contributed to the Balancer DAO as a community member in May of 2020, and he began working full-time for Balancer Labs in January of 2021.\n\nBailey, while continuing to provide engineering services to the team, will broaden his scope of work by handling all business-related operations. He has been with the team since November of 2022. Prior to his time at Balancer, Bailey spent the previous two years working on both the business and engineering side of a fast growing automation startup.\n\nGreg previously worked as a Senior Integrations Engineer at Orb Collective and will continue contributing to the Three Rocks team in a similar capacity. He originally contributed to the Balancer DAO during V1 as a community member beginning in August of 2020, and he began working full-time for Balancer Labs in March of 2021.\n\nMkflow previously worked as a Solutions Engineer at Orb Collective, and will continue providing engineering services to the integrations team. He began contributing to the Balancer DAO in September of 2021 as a Baller, initially as part of the [opsSubDAO](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x26bba9a2dbe293c88d7e6f1de7849a5c96f8376a7a7eac713bc5da0c35276a66). He later served as a Board member of the [Balancer Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x357877d9d3d121e929f66cad2349987fc658be449585f8d021319b69a3a0e620) and has worked full-time with Orb Collective for the entirety of its first funding year.\n\n# Pledge to abide by the DAO’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88)\nYes\n\n# Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1)\nYes\n\n# Domains of Operation\nOur primary operating domain centers around external integrations. This entails writing and peer reviewing code with strategic partners as well as providing assistance and advice. We also support the ecosystem internally by providing development tooling, contributing to core Balancer work, and advising the Balancer Maxis on technical matters related to DAO operations.\n\n# Key Objectives & Success Metrics\n## The Integrations Life Cycle\nThe integration pipeline can be broken into three primary, chronological stages: **bespoke integrations**, **developer experience**, and **generalized infrastructure**. Each stage is critical in its own right, but it is important to recognize that these stages represent different points in the life cycle of a Balancer product area. As such, the ultimate goal is generalized infrastructure. Once this is established, the given product area self-sustains; integrations are both well understood and trivial to implement.\n\nThe Integrations Team recognizes that generalized infrastructure has historically been overlooked. Throughout the team’s history, we’ve mostly dealt with bespoke integrations, and more recently we’ve pushed focus towards the broader developer experience. We believe it is critical for Balancer’s long-term adoption that we take the final step to generalized infrastructure. We also acknowledge that this cannot be tackled prematurely, and so we describe our full approach below.\n\n### Bespoke Integrations\nIn the early days of a product area (e.g., Boosted Pools, Managed Pools, BPT as Collateral), no singular entity possesses full context as to both how the product works and how it will be used in the wild. Third-party developers lack knowledge of how it works, and the core protocol team lacks insight into its future usage. In this stage, bespoke integrations dominate, and a **hands-on** approach is required from the Integrations Team to bridge the gap.\n\n### Developer Experience\nAs the Integrations Team facilitates more and more bespoke integrations in a given product area, it can start to distill its findings with the goal of enhancing the developer experience. Each subsequent integration should be easier to execute than the last. This stage emphasizes documentation, example code, and possibly additional tooling such as simulations. The approach to partner support becomes progressively more **automated** as the common ground across various integrations starts to take shape.\n\n### Generalized Infrastructure\nAfter a wealth of knowledge is accumulated for a given product area, it is often beneficial to roll out generalized infrastructure to facilitate future integrations. At this stage, the product area is so well understood and its usage patterns so well documented that the generalized form looks obvious in hindsight. Finally, it is time to develop peripheral smart contracts or other tools to approach one-click integrations in the given product area. After this work is completed, the Integrations Team can switch to **hands-off** as third-party developers now have all they need to build their integrations unassisted.\n\nAn example of generalized infrastructure is canonical smart contracts to perform a common task. Consider that each of a dozen third-party teams has developed its own custom BPT oracle to solve the BPT as collateral problem, and all of these implementations display very similar patterns. The Integrations Team is responsible for peer-reviewing each implementation, and so this represents a highly inefficient use of the team’s time and the Balancer Ecosystem’s capital, not to mention the duplication of work across the entire DeFi sphere. It would be better for the Integrations Team to recognize this trend and ship a canonical oracle contract for this purpose.\n\nThe same system can be applied to factories. Consider that a canonical contract already exists, but it is repeatedly deployed with small tweaks to parameters and/or logic each time. If each customization requires a dedicated review, this is highly inefficient. It would be better to craft a factory for this contract which provides the levers necessary for specifying those parameters and/or logic in a safe and self-evident way.\n\n### Examples\nFor illustrative purposes, we present a few known examples of the Integrations Life Cycle in action, some actual and some hypothetical.\n\n| Product Area | Bespoke Integrations | Developer Experience | Generalized Infrastructure |\n| - | - | - | - |\n| Boosted Pools | Bespoke linear pools, peer-reviewed or developed in-house | Documentation and central linear pools repository for external contributions | Coalescence on the ERC-4626 standard |\n| BPT as Collateral | Bespoke oracles, peer-designed and/or peer-reviewed | Documentation and code snippets for developing oracles | BPT oracle contracts or factory, formally audited |\n| LST Stable Pools | Bespoke rate providers, peer-reviewed or developed in-house | Documentation on rate providers, some full contracts available | Rate provider factories: Chainlink, LiquidStaking (used by Coinbase, Binance), LayerZero |\n\n### Conclusions and Goals\nThis life cycle, and its culmination in generalized infrastructure, serves to reduce the error surface of external integrations. Even when thorough documentation is available, the same errors show again and again in third-party code, and the Balancer Ecosystem wastes time and capital on manual support. Generalization also reduces the time, effort, and expertise required to launch an integration, thus amplifying the rate of adoption and further saving time and capital for the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nWe believe that the Integrations Team is uniquely suited to overseeing this pipeline from start to finish given the symbiotic relationship among all three stages and the team’s historical role in the first two. The Integrations Team has always been positioned at the start of the funnel and dealt with a plethora of bespoke integrations but previously lacked a deliberate framework for disseminating its conclusions more broadly and usefully.\n\nWith this framework now in mind, we request autonomy to manage the pipeline effectively, including to decide when a given product area is ready for generalization and how that effort should be prioritized in light of demand from partners. On the flip side, we also commit not to over-budget for any one product area or prematurely escalate to full generalization. We believe these were the key failings of the Managed Pool project last year; we prematurely generalized our solution which led to roadmap delays, and we committed too many of our limited resources towards one product area which didn’t showcase sufficient diversity of demand.\n\n## Vulnerability Response\nOne of the Integrations Team’s key responsibilities in the Ecosystem is to maintain contact with all known partners building on top of the Balancer tech stack. These lines of communication are useful for day-to-day interactions but are particularly critical for vulnerability response.\n\nWhen a core Balancer vulnerability is discovered, such as the read-only reentrancy bug from earlier this year, the Integrations Team must first work with the Balancer Labs Smart Contracts Team to understand the scope of the issue. We then must determine all vectors via which it may impact known partners and discreetly work with partner dev teams to secure their production code. To date, the Integrations Team has helped to secure over $4,000,000 of at-risk funds prior to public disclosure of core vulnerabilities.\n\nIn other cases, a partner project may be exploited and set up a war room in which the Integrations Team participates. We help the partner to determine if the exploit was related to a known or yet-unknown Balancer issue and develop a plan for patching the issue.\n\nIn either case, vulnerability response is a time-critical function that overrides existing priorities. It is expected that these events occur quite rarely but that when they do, all other work is suspended until all known issues are resolved. For safety reasons, it may not always be possible to communicate outwardly when an incident is in progress, and so some trust - that the Integrations Team will take this responsibility seriously and execute efficiently before returning to other work - is required.\n\n## Focus Areas & Goals\nIn summary, we derive the following core responsibilities of the Integrations Team from the philosophy outlined above:\n\n* Bespoke Integrations\n    * Q&A with partners in Telegram\n    * Iterative design with certain high-value partners\n    * Code implementation with highest-value partners\n    * Code review for anything to be deployed and used by the Balancer Ecosystem\n        * Partner projects\n        * Balancer Maxis projects\n        * Balancer Grants projects\n* Developer Experience\n    * Documentation\n    * Code Examples\n    * Tooling and Simulations\n* Generalized Infrastructure\n    * Medium-term smart contract development\n    * Formal audits - funds sourced from the DAO on a case-by-case basis\n* Vulnerability Response\n    * Analysis and investigation with BLabs \n    * Coordination with Partners\n### GitHub Repositories\nIn pursuit of the goals defined above, the Integrations Team is directly responsible for the following GitHub repositories:\n* [Balpy](https://github.com/balancer/balpy)\n* [Linear Pools](https://github.com/orbcollective/linear-pools)\n* [Rate Providers](https://github.com/balancer/metastable-rate-providers)\n* [MPC Examples](https://github.com/orbcollective/mpc-examples)\n\nThe team also contributes to several additional repositories:\n* [Balancer V2 Monorepo](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo)\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/balancer/docs)\n* [SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk)\n* [Scaffold](https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer)\n* Various partner code bases\n\n## Continued Commitments\nFor the past few months, we have continued to execute according to the commitment defined in [our May-July roadmap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-orb-collectives-path-forward-extended-integrations-team-plan/4777). Our goal is to complete all of this work by July 31, and we have already provided an update on our progress for [May](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-may-2023-integrations-update/4852), with another update for June to follow soon after this proposal. In the event that any work is left unfinished at the end of July, we will carry that forward into our next funding period.\n\n## Metrics\nIdentifying and tracking metrics for success has been a struggle for the Integrations Team in the past. We recognize that this is an important aspect of business that helps the DAO make necessary decisions on the effectiveness of a Service Provider. In order to promote this effort, we outline several key metrics that will enable us to track and report on our organizational performance.\n\nThe core on-chain metrics needed to establish a sufficient indicator of Integrations performance are **Total Value Locked (TVL)**, **swap volume**, and **protocol revenue**. Tracking these variables for deployments that are direct results of our contributions will allow us to conduct a time tracking analysis that we expect will help us quantify the **cost/value proposition** of specific types of integrations.\n\nWe plan to utilize Dune Analytics to perform this study by tagging Factories, Pools, Rate Providers and other production contracts to which we contribute. For off-chain tools such as Balpy, we plan to monitor volume by inserting a minimal calldata identifier into each transaction. We hope this allows us to get a better understanding of the value added for partner integrations and uncovers hidden areas of improvement to make the integration process more profitable for the DAO.\n\nAdditionally we plan to produce vulnerability metrics to highlight the **value of funds secured** during exploits.\n\n## Reporting\n### Weekly roadmap sync\nWe will continue to send the team lead to a weekly roadmap sync with other engineering leads and ecosystem leaders. The purpose of this session is to provide internal progress updates, synchronize on strategy, and field incoming requests from other ecosystem participants.\n\n### Monthly forum update\nWe will also continue to provide monthly updates on the governance forum. Though we still intend to use these posts to inform the community on completed work and describe any changes to our internal strategy, we will now focus more on the hard metrics defined above. Our goal is to provide a framework for the DAO to evaluate the team’s performance.\n\n# Length of Engagement & Budget\nFive months - **August 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023** - divided into two quarters.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories in USDC by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up.\n\n \n![bip352-1.png](ipfs://bafkreihxbosjk4lnlljmi35t5p4iiu4a2zlf62xvzdxlcvea67ffna6fn4)\n    \n\n## Requests for USDC transfers\n* August 1, 2023: **125,961 USDC**\n* October 1, 2023: **180,211 USDC**\n\n### USDC Budget Breakdown\nPreviously within this proposal, we highlighted the lean structure of our organization and team, which is designed to alleviate any financial pressure on the DAO. This enables us to have a minimalistic financial outline, as shown above.\n\nEach Engineer on our team operates as an independent contractor, a factor that is reflected in the budget by only requiring the organization to handle a contractor’s base pay. Operational costs are kept at a bare minimum and contain insurance, software subscriptions and tax/accounting services. Because this is a new organization, we also have onboarding costs which encapsulate all startup expenses for the company. These expenses include required insurance down payments, company formation/registration and licenses, as well as branding and initial technology costs.\n\nLegal expenses are not included in our budget, as we are also proposing to be granted a seat on the Ecosystem Council as well as reasonable access to legal support and guidance from GRC resources.\n\n## Requests for BAL transfers\n* August 1, 2023: **62,230.58 BAL**\n\n### BAL Budget Breakdown\nIn addition to USDC, the Integrations Team is requesting 62,230.58 BAL to cover commitments made in previous employment packages with Balancer Labs and Orb Collective. These BAL tokens would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4 year vesting basis, with a 1 year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nThe funds will be held in on-chain vesting contracts. These are currently under development, and the source code will be provided at a later date. We are building upon OpenZeppelin’s [VestingWallet](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/874c2d3c02ec1bce6af9a30bc828d3fe2079136b/contracts/finance/VestingWallet.sol) contract and adding two features:\n* A vesting cliff to respect the existing incentive format.\n* An owner who is distinct from the recipient. The owner has the power to claw back the unvested balance.\n\nThe full amount of BAL tokens will be required up front and used to seed the vesting contracts for each individual contributor. It can be repossessed by the OpCo and returned to the Balancer Treasury upon termination of a contributor’s contract.\n\n## Impact on the Treasury\nThe Treasury currently holds ~4.5M USDC. Funding the Integrations Team for the remainder of FY2023 would cost around ~6.8% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~16%. The 62,230.58 BAL requested in this proposal are currently in possession of Orb Collective and will soon be returned to the Treasury, so the Integrations Team does not require any net new BAL.\n\n# ETH Address to Receive Funds\nThree Rocks wishes to be funded via the OpCo, whose multisig address is:\n**0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693**\n\n# Link to SLA\nThree Rocks will enter into an agreement with the OpCo in the event that this proposal is accepted. At that time, we will edit this post with a link to the agreement for posterity.",
