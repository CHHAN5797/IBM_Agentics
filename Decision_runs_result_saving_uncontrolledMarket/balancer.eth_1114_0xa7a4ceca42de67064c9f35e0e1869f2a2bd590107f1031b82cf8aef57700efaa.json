By deploying this new pool, users will be able to borrow $R stablecoin on the Raft protocol and provide liquidity on a R/sDAI boosted stable pool without giving up the whole 3.49% DSR (DAI Savings Rate) accrued on DAI deposited in the DSR module. The deployment of this pool embraces the ongoing expansion of $sDAI, the yield-bearing version of DAI, and eliminates the opportunity cost that current LPs in DAI pools face. A future integration of sDAI as a collateral token in Raft could further strengthen the utilization of such a pool, allowing users to use sDAI to leverage up.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n· Website: [https://raft.fi/ ](https://raft.fi/)\n· Documentation: https://docs.raft.fi/\n· Twitter: https://twitter.com/raft_fi\n· Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/raft-fi)\n· GitHub: [Raft · GitHub](https://github.com/raft-fi/)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Raft is a DeFi protocol that lets you generate $R by depositing liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) as collateral. R is a decentralized USD stablecoin with deep liquidity across many trading pairs and a stable peg. Raft provides a capital-efficient way to borrow while keeping your staking rewards. As more use cases for $R develop, users will be able to spend, swap, and earn with $R. Users will also be able to leverage up to 6x on different LSD tokens in a single atomic transaction.\n \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The R/sDAI boosted pool on Balancer represents the natural evolution of the current R/DAI pool and will allow all Raft users to swap their borrowed $R into $sDAI (or any other asset via multi-step swaps). Users holding $sDAI can earn the DSR yield accrued on the underlying DAI deposited in the DSR module and then use all money markets, DEXs, liquidity pools and vaults, NFT marketplaces, and all other products, on every chain where $sDAI can be bridged.  \n\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** The Raft protocol is governance-minimized. This means nobody controls any key part or mechanism affecting the core protocol functionality. There is no way to pause the smart contracts. The Raft team only has the ability to adjust fees\n\n2. **Oracles:** The pool relies on price feeds from Chainlink and Tellor\n\n3. **Audits:** Raft is audited by Trail of Bits and Hats Finance\n- [ Trail of Bits audit - May 2023](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-04-tempus-raft-securityreview.pdf)\n\n- [ Hats Finance audit competition - May 2023](https://twitter.com/hatsfinance/status/1659263484641660928)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** \n- Liquidations are permissionless (anybody can liquidate)\n- The key parts of Raft protocol are immutable\n- [Liquidity Committee](https://docs.raft.fi/about-r/soft-peg/liquidity-committee) 3 Raft team members. More to be added in the future as the Raft governance evolves\n\n5. **Market History:** Raft was launched on June 5th 2023, and has attracted approx $53m TVL. The Raft team has worked with the Balancer community to launch two successful pools (see $R here, the R/DAI pool on Balancer[ here](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x20a61b948e33879ce7f23e535cc7baa3bc66c5a9000000000000000000000555) and $sDAI[ here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x83f20f44975d03b1b09e64809b757c47f942beea)) we would like to continue being a proponent of Balancer going forward.\n \n6. **Value:** The R/DAI pool deployed on Balancer has been among the top 3 pools on Balancer by trading volume in the last few weeks, gathering $ 42 mln TVL in less than a month. We expect the R/sDAI pool to generate an even higher volume due to the enhanced capital efficiency of holding $sDAI instead of $DAI, which will benefit all LPs and users of Raft.\n\n**Links to pool:** [0xbF2ef8bDC2fC0F3203B3a01778E3ec5009AEEf33](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xBF2EF8BDC2FC0F3203B3A01778E3EC5009AEEF3300000000000000000000058D)\n**Links to gauge:** [0x882f961Def46deadAcf31798B295834a5b6d0c86](https://etherscan.io/address/0x882f961Def46deadAcf31798B295834a5b6d0c86#code)\n\n**Specifications:**\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x882f961Def46deadAcf31798B295834a5b6d0c86`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/2032\n\n## Summary\n\nThis publication proposed enabling new **rETH/aWETH** gauges for Composable Stable pool on Balancer v3 for Arbitrum, Base and Optimism.\n\n## References/Useful Links\n\n- [Rocket Pool Website](https://rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/)\n- [Rocket Pool GitHub](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool)\n- [Rocket Pool Twitter](https://twitter.com/rocket_pool)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol that allows users to stake ETH and receive rETH, a liquid staking token representing their staked ETH plus accrued rewards. The protocol is designed to be community-owned, decentralized, and trustless, aligning with Ethereum's core principles.\n\nrETH accrues staking rewards over time, reflecting the performance of the underlying validators operated by a decentralized network of node operators. Users can stake as little as 0.01 ETH, making staking accessible to a broader audience.\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), which oversees protocol parameters and upgrades, ensuring that the protocol remains community-driven and secure.\n\nFor more details, see the [Rocket Pool Documentation](https://docs.rocketpool.net/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3 with an Aave Boosted pool will enhance the capital efficiency of the rETH liquidity pools. The integration of aWETH (aArbWETH; aBasWETH, aOptWETH), which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and provides liquidity providers with additional yield opportunities.\n\nThe new **rETH/aWETH** pools will serve as the primary liquidity venue for rETH on L2s, replacing the existing v2 pool. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users interacting with Aave-based strategies.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for rETH.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nRocket Pool's governance is managed by the Protocol DAO (pDAO), comprising RPL token holders who vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes. This decentralized governance model ensures that the protocol remains aligned with the interests of its community.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nRocket Pool utilizes a decentralized oracle network operated by the Oracle DAO (oDAO), which consists of independent node operators. These oracles are responsible for reporting validator balances and other critical data to the protocol's smart contracts, ensuring accurate and reliable operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nRocket Pool's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [Rocket Pool GitHub repository](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nRocket Pool is designed to minimize centralization risks. Governance decisions are executed by the pDAO, and the oracle network is decentralized across multiple independent operators, ensuring robust security and trustlessness throughout the protocol.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nThe existing Balancer v2 rETH/WETH pools have demonstrated strong performance, serving as a significant liquidity venue for rETH. Transitioning to a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool is expected to further enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Base](https://balancer.fi/pools/base/v2/0xc771c1a5905420daec317b154eb13e4198ba97d0000000000000000000000023)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Arbitrum](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xade4a71bb62bec25154cfc7e6ff49a513b491e81000000000000000000000497)\n- [Balancer V2 Pool on Optimism](https://balancer.fi/pools/optimism/v2/0x4fd63966879300cafafbb35d157dc5229278ed2300020000000000000000002b)\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **rETH/aWETH** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for rETH on L2s, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aWETH. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and the ease of leveraging or unwinding on lending protocols.\n\n## Specification\n\nFollowing root gauges need to be added to the gauge controller\n\n|Chain|Pool|Pool Address|Root Gauge|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Arbitrum|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x5418a64e0cdb20548ACB394f5D00a089BAf02161|0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb|\n|Base|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0xB7B8B3AfC010169779C5C2385ec0eB0477FE3347|0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6|\n|Optimism|v3 rETH/aave-WETH|0x870c0Af8A1af0B58b4b0bD31CE4fe72864ae45BE|0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8|\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: \n\ngauge(address):`0xac3b3fff577561c58f126e4f6375f56476dd9fdb` \ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum` \n\ngauge(address):`0x31ccb4e5005fd37005523e6e3f1d084f9abe25b6` \ngaugeType(string): `Base` \n\ngauge(address):`0xd606ea6f6d93d90efafc7d21972353fb98205eb8` \ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",

By introducing this gauge, we aim to incentivize liquidity provision and enhance trading activity for the MORE stablecoin on Base. This pool will serve as the primary liquidity source for MORE on Base.\n\nPool: Liquidity Pool (v2): MORE/USDC\nPool contract: https://basescan.org/address/0x0008a59c1d2e5922790c929ea432ed02d4d3323a\nChild gauge: 0x04eB463335845e8B8d46d410B344Fd2187BbF87C\nRoot Gauge: 0xF55ab397a9DB73D352A883eaC4777B14eE2E4bBf\nReferences / Useful Links\n\nWebsite / App\nDocs\nX\nDiscord\nProtocol Description\n\nMORE is a collateral-backed stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, issued by Stack Finance.\nUSDC is a stablecoin that is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis. Every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is backed up by $1 that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. The Centre consortium, which is behind this asset, says USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions.\nStack Finance is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol on the re.al L2 network, specializing in leveraging crypto-native and real-world asset (RWA) tokens. Users can deposit a variety of assets as collateral to borrow the stablecoin MORE. Advanced leverage features allow users to loop borrowed MORE to acquire additional collateral, making it highly effective when using yield-bearing tokens. Stack Finance is uniquely positioned to cater specifically to tokenized RWAs as the re.al blockchain is meant to be a liquidity hub for RWA DeFi.\n\nMORE is designed to maintain a $1 peg through collateral backing that exceeds $1 for every $1 of MORE issued. While Stack Finance considers MORE to be worth $1, the price may occasionally deviate. To stabilize the peg, the protocol employs mechanisms like interest rate adjustments and arbitrage opportunities, encouraging users to act in ways that restore the peg.\n\nMotivation\n\nEnabling a gauge for the MORE/USDC pool on Base aligns with Stack Finance’s strategy to expand MORE’s liquidity across multiple chain ecosystems. This initiative aims to boost liquidity by attracting more liquidity providers, enhance the trading experience through improved price stability and reduced slippage, which will help Stack Finance to strengthen its DeFi integrations.\n\nSpecifications\n\nGovernance: Stack Finance’s governance is currently managed through a team-controlled multi-signature wallet. The protocol plans to transition to a decentralized governance model in the future, once the system achieves greater stability and market resilience.\nOracles: There are currently no oracles for MORE on Base. The protocol does not rely on external oracles for its core functionalities on this network.\nAudits: Prior to deployment, Stack Finance underwent two comprehensive audit rounds to ensure the security and reliability of the protocol. The first was a private audit conducted by Omniscia, and the second audit was a public one performed by WatchPug. The detailed report from WatchPug’s audit can be viewed here.\nCentralization Vectors: Currently, Stack Finance has centralization vectors primarily associated with upgradeability and governance control. The protocol’s smart contracts are upgradeable via a multi-signature wallet controlled by the team. Additionally, until the protocol transitions to a decentralized governance model, the team retains control over protocol parameters and decision-making processes.\nMarket History: Since its launch in June 2024 on the re.al L2, Stack Finance has accumulated over $26M in TVL. The MORE stablecoin has consistently maintained its $1 peg, experiencing a maximum deviation of 2%, which was swiftly corrected as per protocol designed mechanisms. Stack Finance has deployed MORE liquidity pools across multiple ecosystems, including a MORE/USDT pool on ThenaFi on the BNB Chain, a MORE/USDC pool on Tokan on Scroll, and a MORE/USTB pool on PearlFi on re.al.\nValue: The MORE/USDC pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for MORE on Base. Enabling the gauge will incentivize liquidity providers by offering veBAL rewards and additional bribes from Stack Finance, thereby attracting more participants and increasing the pool’s depth. This will generate consistent fees through heightened trading activity, benefiting the Balancer ecosystem as a consequence.\n\nTechnical Specifications:\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0xF55ab397a9DB73D352A883eaC4777B14eE2E4bBf\n\ngaugeType(string): Base",

USDX captures yield from crypto-native sources and distributes it back to its users.\n* sUSDX is a staked version of USDX; yield for sUSDX currently stands around 3.5%.\n* USDT is a fiat-backed USD-denominated stablecoin, issued by Tether.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n* Stables Labs has concluded Season 1 of its points campaign, and saw rapid increase in its TVL. Our previous collaboration with Balancer has proven extremely effective, as our sUSDX/USDX became Balancer v2 Arbitrum’s biggest pool (TVL ~$10M). We would like to use sUSDX/USDX/aUSDT Balancer v3 pool on Mainnet to boostrap long-awaited mainnet liquidity, and allow users to enjoy greater yield, and deep pool of liquidity to swap through.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance**: currently owned by 0x3f9a06aD4c83c289DF83461fE5F24EE4c4491935 (3 out of 4 multisig).\n2. **Oracles**: The protocol does not reply on external oracles.\n3. **Audits**: [link](https://1166152427-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F5mdBNVoaU0Rn0IEZP0Y1%2Fuploads%2FAGLbaiVubfT1xuY1FdmH%2FBlocksec_Security_Audit_Report_for_USDX.pdf?alt=media&token=6326b906-c1b4-49cd-b670-666baee5d030). Additional audit reports can be viewed on [Audit | usdx.money](https://docs.usdx.money/informaiton/audit)\n4. **Centralization vectors**: The centralization vectors primarily relate to the owner of the contracts, which is a 3 out of 4 multisig. The team has 15 full-time, doxxed contributors.\n5. **Market history**: USDX has not previously de-pegged, and sUSDX is an ERC4626 token. Balancer pools for USDX/USDT and sUSDX/USDX have previously been deployed.\n6. **Value**: USDX currently has $620M in TVL, making it the 4th largest protocol by TVL on [BNB Chain](https://defillama.com/chain/BSC), and 6th largest protocol by TVL on [Arbitrum](https://defillama.com/chain/Arbitrum). We will also be launching our RWA product soon, which would bring healthy amount of attention and activities around Stables Labs and USDX.\n\nsUSDX -USDX-aUSDT Pool [Balancer DeFi Liquidity Pools](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v3/0xf40A27C779C74596E063906B2741fa37A36c0957)\n\nGauge https://etherscan.io/address/0x2A42644C1D3e1b4FE6d01Fdbc995Fc402694a49f\n\n## Technical Specifications:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): [`0x2A42644C1D3e1b4FE6d01Fdbc995Fc402694a49f`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2A42644C1D3e1b4FE6d01Fdbc995Fc402694a49f)\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "## PR with Payload\n\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1377\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to enable a veBAL gauge for the MORE/GYD E-CLP pool on Arbitrum, created in partnership with Gyroscope. By introducing this gauge, we aim to incentivize liquidity provision and enhance trading activity for the MORE stablecoin on Arbitrum. This pool will serve as the primary liquidity source for MORE on Arbitrum and will utilize Gyroscope's innovative E-CLP technology.\n\n* Pool:https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x4284c68f567903537e2d9ff726fdf8591e431ddc0002000000000000000005b5\n* Child gauge on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3b9c6c47bd3ac2e5e284265757ea2f6a4aed5fcc\n* Arbitrum root gauge on Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2400b9BAfb56Ec6D9eCeE50aF463A155Cf46db98#readContract\n\n## References / Useful Links\n\n* [Website / App](https://www.stackmore.xyz/)\n* [Docs](https://docs.stackmore.xyz/)\n* [X](https://x.com/stackmorexyz)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/M5jG6t8JQE)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\n* MORE is a collateral-backed stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, issued by Stack Finance.\n* GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by [Gyroscope] https://gyro.finance/\n\nStack Finance is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol on the re.al L2 network, specializing in leveraging crypto-native and real-world asset (RWA) tokens. Users can deposit a variety of assets as collateral to borrow the stablecoin MORE. Advanced leverage features allow users to loop borrowed MORE to acquire additional collateral, making it highly effective when using yield-bearing tokens. Stack Finance is uniquely positioned to cater specifically to tokenized RWAs as the re.al blockchain is meant to be a liquidity hub for RWA DeFi.\n\nMORE is designed to maintain a $1 peg through collateral backing that exceeds $1 for every $1 of MORE issued. While Stack Finance considers MORE to be worth $1, the price may occasionally deviate. To stabilize the peg, the protocol employs mechanisms like interest rate adjustments and arbitrage opportunities, encouraging users to act in ways that restore the peg.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEnabling a gauge for the MORE/USDC E-CLP pool on Arbitrum aligns with Stack Finance's strategy to expand MORE's liquidity across multiple chain ecosystems. This initiative aims to boost liquidity by attracting more liquidity providers, enhance the trading experience through improved price stability and reduced slippage, which will help Stack Finance to strengthen its DeFi integrations.\n\n## Specifications\n\n* Governance: Stack Finance's governance is currently managed through a team-controlled multi-signature wallet. The protocol plans to transition to a decentralized governance model in the future, once the system achieves greater stability and market resilience.\n* Oracles: There are currently no oracles for MORE on Arbitrum. The protocol does not rely on external oracles for its core functionalities on this network.\n* Audits: Prior to deployment, Stack Finance underwent two comprehensive audit rounds to ensure the security and reliability of the protocol. The first was a private audit conducted by Omniscia, and the second audit was a public one performed by WatchPug. The detailed report from WatchPug's audit can be viewed[ here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlnOyweoD9Jy_0vNvDozPS5RVEOw_qwT/view).\n* Centralization Vectors: Currently, Stack Finance has centralization vectors primarily associated with upgradeability and governance control. The protocol's smart contracts are upgradeable via a multi-signature wallet controlled by the team. Additionally, until the protocol transitions to a decentralized governance model, the team retains control over protocol parameters and decision-making processes.\n* Market History: Since its launch in June 2024 on the re.al L2, Stack Finance has accumulated over $2M in TVL. The MORE stablecoin has consistently maintained its $1 peg, experiencing a maximum deviation of 2%, which was swiftly corrected as per protocol designed mechanisms. Stack Finance has deployed MORE liquidity pools across multiple ecosystems, including a MORE/USDT pool on ThenaFi on the BNB Chain, a MORE/USDC pool on Tokan on Scroll, and a MORE/USTB pool on PearlFi on re.al.\n* Value: The MORE/GYD E-CLP pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for MORE on Arbitrum. Enabling the gauge will incentivize liquidity providers by offering veBAL rewards and additional bribes from Stack Finance, thereby attracting more participants and increasing the pool's depth. This will generate consistent fees through heightened trading activity, benefiting the Balancer ecosystem as a consequence.\n\n#### Specification\n\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>\n>\n> gauge(address): `0x2400b9BAfb56Ec6D9eCeE50aF463A155Cf46db98`\n> gaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
