First, the existing cross-chain governance solution will be applied to Arbitrum & Optimism. In parallel, BGD Labs is working on a more generalized solution that will apply to all the networks, if approved by the community via AIP vote.\n\nThe consequence of the governance V3 implementation will limit the Guardian’s responsibilities to a failsafe emergency actor allowed to freeze Aave markets or cancel AIPs if they’re deemed insecure or malicious.\n\nA snapshot vote will be published 5 days after the publication of this thread allowing the community to vote on this Guardian renewal.",

        "body": "Title: [ARC] Risk Parameter Updates for Ethereum Aave v2 Market\nauthor: @MarcZeller @MatthewGraham @Llamaxyz \ncreated: 20-08-2022\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIn response to Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by FEI borrowers to the Reserve Factor.\n\n## Abstract\n\nTribe DAO is dissolving the DAO’s assets and TRIBE governance token. As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI.\n\nAs FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEI’s circulating supply and liquidity will also fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market.\n\nIn response to recent events, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. A separate forum post will emerge that recommends all aFEI be redeemed for FEI and swapped for DAI via the contracts deployed by Tribe DAO.\n\nThis proposal is to disable lending and borrowing of FEI whilst enabling existing debt to be repaid and collateral to be withdrawn.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI lending market in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state.\n\nThe details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475).\n\nAs FEI will be redeemed for DAI, the stablecoin will suffer diminishing liquidity and diminishing supply. This renders the FEI stablecoin not suitable as a supported asset on Aave markets.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe recommendation is to disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor.\n\n**Risk Parameters:**\n\nFreeze the FEI market which will:\n\nBorrowing Enabled → Disable \nLending Enabled → Disable \n\nAlso,\n\nReserve Factor 20% → 100%\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 24th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to modify FEI risk parameters as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
