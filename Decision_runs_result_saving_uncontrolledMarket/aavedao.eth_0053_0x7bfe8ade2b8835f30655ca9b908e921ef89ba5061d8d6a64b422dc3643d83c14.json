        "body": "**Title:** [ARFC] karpatkey GHO Growth Service Provider\n\n**Author**: karpatkey\n\n**Date**: 2024-12-15\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicexfltthusqm4b5qldyfuuowezre3mgkvnipzgdlskwl432sgakm)\n    \n\n\n# Summary\n\nThe current ARFC proposes appointing karpatkey as a service provider dedicated to drive the growth of GHO for the following 6 months, with an initial focus on opportunities within the Gnosis Chain while also expanding efforts to other chains.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past 12 months, karpatkey has been pleased to have supported the AaveDAO in improving treasury management practices and GHO adoption (see [Phase 1](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633) and [Phase 2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-tokenlogic-karpatkey-financial-service-providers-phase-ii/18285) for more details). These efforts have been a significant success, and will continue, with the deployment of the [Finance Steward](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570)  upcoming features. That said, by focusing on increasing GHO’s adoption, we believe karpatkey can provide more value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nThe stablecoin ecosystem is one of the most dynamic and competitive sectors in the DeFi landscape, and the accelerating adoption of GHO represents a unique opportunity for Aave DAO to solidify its position as a leader in this space. Since its deployment over a year ago, GHO achieved a notable milestone of a 180M supply across mainnet and Arbitrum, market depth in most reputable DEXes with total liquidity ranging between $30M and $50M. This success is a testament to the strength of Aave’s products, user base and brand.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigsbyl7vbhlbp4cwk7usqueivly4cdhtz7ibdvois3zerjx5t5xsm)\n    \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibrbisgdqx6tbdqbo5sxztbuakpbxe6rq5qd5v3irsufufwn57aju)\n    \n\nSource: [GHO Dashboard](https://dune.com/karpatkey/gho-weekly-digest-kpk)\n\nWhile GHO’s initial growth has been remarkable, the stablecoin market is evolving rapidly. The demand for reliable, decentralised stablecoins continues to grow, and GHO is well-positioned to capture this market—provided we continue to expand its utility, adoption, and ecosystem integrations proactively.\n\nkarpatkey has the [tools and resources](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-defi-treasury-network) to capitalise on the range of opportunities GHO presents. With a [proven track record in DeFi innovation](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure) and [strong partnerships with other DAOs](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), we are excited to present our new 6-month proposal to Aave DAO, focused on the areas where we can contribute most.\n\nTo drive proactive growth and expansion of GHO across multiple blockchains, we are proposing a phased mandate that includes tailored strategies for each ecosystem, with the initial phase prioritizing the deployment and adoption of GHO on the Gnosis Chain. With an Aave instance holding $100M, Gnosis Chain currently has a total value locked of $410M and a thriving environment of stablecoins, which includes Gnosis Pay, Monerium’s e-money EURe and other RWAs. We plan to focus primarily on opportunities where both AaveDAO and GnosisDAO can mutually benefit from a vibrant GHO ecosystem on Gnosis Chain, taking advantage of karpatkey’s unique position supporting both the DeFi ecosystems of both DAOs.\n\n# Specification\n\nDuring this first phase, our objectives will include:\n\n- Expanding GHO’s supply and utility through strategic integrations across the blockchains where GHO is deployed, and those where it will be deployed next, establishing GHO as a stablecoin of choice while maintaining its peg stability. karpatkey will continue to support the GHO stewards and the ALC to make this possible.\n- The deployment of GHO on Gnosis Chain,  in collaboration with other Aave Service Providers, to optimise the Gnosis Chain Aave instance for GHO’s adoption and success.\n- Introducing an sGHO vault on Gnosis Chain, building on the success of sDAI. This vault, to be developed in collaboration with @ACI, will provide a risk-minimized yield alternative that can be used as collateral for enhanced capital efficiency. The yield will be sourced through the successful Merit program, and will be amplified on Gnosis Chain by allocating incentives to staked liquidity only, further establishing GHO as a superior savings vehicle.\n- Drive a successful launch by establishing a 5M Aave treasury under non-custodial management infrastructure powered by Safe and [Zodiac Module](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure) technology. This infrastructure, developed by karpatkey and successfully utilized in our contributions to GnosisDAO, ENS, Balancer, and Nexus, will initially be funded with USDC. The treasury will support market-making activities for GHO on Gnosis Chain to seed market liquidity and integrations.\n- Manage the integrations of GHO in Gnosis Chain with key DeFi protocols. Particularly, we will explore optimal lending-market parameters and the value proposition of the EURe/GHO pair, maximizing the value of Gnosis Chain’s long-term foreign exchange use-cases.\n\n**Budget and duration**\n\nAfter a successful vote, this proposal will be funded with the following stream:\n\n- Budget 250K GHO over 180 days.\n- Address: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\nWe propose that the stream be funded with GHO from the Lido market to reduce Aave’s opportunity cost.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nkarpatkey is also a service provider for Gnosis DAO.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nAfter sufficient time for discussion and feedback on this proposal in the forum, we will escalate it to an ARFC Snapshot vote.\n\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP vote will be published for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC]  ACI Phase III - “Ad Astra”\nDate: 2024-04-24\nAuthor: MarcZeller - Aave-chan Initiative\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis ARFC proposes the continuation of the collaboration with the Aave-chan Initiative (ACI) for an additional year, with a proposed budget of 1M GHO.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe ACI has demonstrated significant value to the Aave ecosystem across multiple fronts. The “initiative” launched ~18 months ago is now a team of 8 people strong, including various talents & providing multiple services, contributing to the DAO's success.\nThis proposal seeks to extend our collaboration for another year.\n\n## ACI services:\n\nThe ACI service provider is now an 8-person team offering a variety of services for the Aave DAO. Here’s what we intend to maintain and improve during this proposal engagement:\n\n### Skywards\n\nSkywards has become the default option for the Aave governance as a whole, and the ACI is proud to keep delivering **first-class service to anyone upon simple request**. \n\n### Dolce Vita\n\nDolce Vita is the main “boring & invisible”  service of the ACI; “**Great service is often invisible, but bad service is immediately noticeable**” is our motto for Dolce Vita.\n\nAave DAO revenue is accrued, service provider coordination allows for increased efficiency, and third-party updates and integrations are done **without most community members realizing someone is doing the work in the background**. \n\nDolce Vita might be the lesser-known of all the ACI’s services, but we believe it’s actually one of the most important. We’re happy to maintain, improve, and extend Dolce Vita services along with our continued engagement with the DAO.\n\n### “Ad Astra”: (Growth)\n\nWe consider Growth and Business Development to be the core of ACI services. We coordinated, contributed to, and created numerous proposals to improve the Aave DAO revenue, and the results are clear. The **Aave DAO has never been as profitable as it is now**, and the **DAO net profits have largely overperformed the market conditions**.\n\nThe Aave DAO is the second most profitable DAO, and together, we fully intend **to become the most profitable DAO on earth**.\n\nThis part of our work is also made possible thanks to collaboration with key DAO actors in this vertical, **such as TokenLogic and Karpatkey**. We’re glad to work with them every day, and we all have our own domains of expertise, creating value synergies for this DAO.\n\n**Growth and BD are part of ACI’s DNA**. We intend to maintain and extend our contributions in this vertical.\n\n### Representation:\n\nThe ACI is now an impactful voice for the DAO. The ACI is known to support and defend the Aave DAO’s **best interests internally and externally**.\n\nWe consider that our “chainsaw” arc contributed to making the Aave DAO one of the most efficient and profitable DAOs in the world and to Aave maintaining its leader position in our vertical.\n\nThat being said, we fostered numerous synergistic initiatives to build bridges with the community and attract new users: Merit was a large success for GHO growth & Aave market share growth, APE integrated the DAO as an Arbitrum governance player and **contributed to a 750k $ARB LTIP grant** to support GHO and the **ACI represented the DAO across the globe participating, speaking & sponsoring numerous events**.\n\nWith this continuation proposal, we intend to remain a strong voice for the DAO and remain active both onchain & offchain in conferences. At the time of writing, we have **confirmed participation at Dappcon, EthCC, and Devcon** for the next few months.\n\n## Specifications\n\nProposal duration: 365 Days\nProposal Budget: 1M GHO\n\nNote: this proposal is intended to be a continuation of ACI’s previous streams due to governance mandatory delays to avoid a “gap” in ACI’s engagement, if this proposal is favored by aave governance votes, the AIP payload stream duration will be adjusted to reflect an engagement from May 5th, 2024.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is presenting this ARFC independently and is not compensated by any third party for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes an amendment to our current scope of work and compensation structure accordingly. Chaos Labs is requesting a $400,000 increase, bringing our total annual compensation to $2M.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn November 2023, Chaos Labs’ engagement with Aave DAO was [unanimously renewed](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/360/), underscoring our ongoing commitment and the expanded scope of our engagement with Aave, which has evolved significantly with Aave's expansion now across over 10 deployments.\n\nThis renewal was done during the bear market, prompting us to propose a community-friendly deal at a lower-than-market cost, given the challenging market conditions and being mindful of the broader economic environment. This was aligned with the feedback from major Aave stakeholders and delegates. However, the expansion of Aave to multiple chains, in addition to the increased volatility and activity across DeFi and crypto, has significantly increased our scope and workload, necessitating additional resources to maintain the high level of service required. \n\nAs dedicated risk contributors, Chaos Labs adopts a holistic approach to managing the spectrum of responsibilities within Aave's ecosystem, including V3, GHO, and the continued offboarding of V2. Our commitment encompasses risk management, data science, analytics, and parameter recommendation, among other critical functions. An amendment to our compensation is essential to reflect better the resources committed, the depth of our engagement, and the substantial value we bring to the Aave community.\n\nConsidering improved market conditions and Aave’s growth over the past several months, we believe the DAO is now in a position to revise our compensation to more accurately reflect the current scale and impact of our engagement and allocated resources.\n\n### Enhancing Aave's Risk Management Framework\n\nThe proposed compensation amendment is not merely a financial adjustment but a continued investment in our collaboration. With additional funding, Chaos Labs will be poised to:\n\n- **Deploy Additional Resources:** Enhance support for existing and future Aave markets, ensuring comprehensive risk management across all deployments.\n- **Develop and Optimize Risk Oracles:** Focus efforts on the continued development of the Chaos Risk Oracle specifically for Aave’s needs, enabling more efficient and dynamic risk parameter adjustments. This will further streamline the risk management process, reducing the need for manual interventions and significantly boosting the protocol's operational efficiency and security.\n- **Expansion of Risk Monitoring and Alerts:** Our real-time monitoring and alert services are delivered via the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). We're committed to enriching these services with more comprehensive analytics and alerts, enhancing visibility and enabling users to meticulously evaluate ecosystem risks and the health of the protocol through intuitive dashboards and data visualizations. The deployment of Risk Oracles will introduce additional data, providing the community with an improved grasp of risk levels and updates to protocol parameters.\n\n### Collaborative Expansion with a Second Risk Service Provider\n\nFollowing Gauntlet's resignation as the second-risk service provider, we strongly support the idea of bringing on another service provider to complement our existing scope of work. As part of our engagement, we are committed to dedicating the required resources to assist with the onboarding process and ongoing collaborations, ensuring a seamless integration that enhances Aave's risk management capabilities without duplicating efforts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe requested compensation amendment is key for Chaos Labs to sustain and expand its support for Aave. It will enable us to allocate additional resources effectively, develop innovative solutions like the Risk Oracle, and continue our mission to enhance Aave's security and efficiency. We are committed to our partnership with Aave and believe that with the community's support, we can continue setting the standards for risk management in the industry.\n\n## Specification:\n\nWe request an additional $400K for the remainder of our current engagement, bringing the total annual compensation to $2M. \n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 400,000 aUSDC or GHO. \n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and more. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP).\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 MVP deployment on Neon EVM Mainnet\n\nAuthor: Neon Foundation & Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of Aave V3 MVP on the NEON EVM Mainnet, expanding Aave’s presence and enabling access to unaddressed users, liquidity, community and ecosystem of Solana.\n\n# Background:\n\nNeon EVM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment solution built on the Solana blockchain which makes it the first parallelized EVM with direct access to Solana liquidity. Neon EVM allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps on Solana and access its native ecosystem and network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities without changing their codebases. Neon EVM currently has interoperability with Solana SPL tokens and the plan is to develop full interoperability with Solana smart contracts as well in 2024.\n\nSolana is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. Solana ecosystem took a hit due to market conditions and FTX situation last year as TVL fell from all-time high of +$9b to +$250m in July 2023 but since then it has shown strong growth and it’s the fastest growing ecosystem across major blockchain networks. Current TVL is over $1.5b making it the fifth-largest chain by TVL.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave has emerged as a prominent player in DeFi lending across various EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, including Ethereum, alt L1s, and L2s. Neon EVM wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Neon EVM Mainnet to expand lending to the Solana ecosystem. Aave’s expansion to the largest non-EVM ecosystem will further reinforce its place as the top liquidity market on-chain and open up possibilities for growth and collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and Neon EVM communities.\n\nAave V3 deployment on Neon EVM will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Solana and enables Solana ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through Neon EVM. The platform will allow Aave to deploy on Solana without any reconfiguration of the Aave v3 codebase and hence without incurring major development efforts and costs to the Aave DAO. Also, a third-party team has already deployed Aave V3 fork on Neon EVM Devnet which implies the full compatibility of Aave V3 codebase with Neon EVM.\n\nThese benefits of Neon EVM combined with Aave’s impressive push for a cross-chain future, provide an exciting opportunity to capture the market share of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and grow the user base and community of the protocol, increase TVL, and protocol revenue. At the same time, Neon EVM would benefit from having a trusted, flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users and wider Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe deployment of Aave v3 on the Neon EVM would enable Aave to tap into the Solana DeFi market and make a unique and significant contribution to the decentralized finance movement. This deployment is expected to substantially reduce costs and better scalability in comparison to EVM networks, while also providing users with access to Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. As Solana gains momentum as a prominent blockchain platform, the integration of Aave’s advanced lending and borrowing protocol could further catalyze the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and Neon EVM.\n\nThere have been significant concerns around the Downtime of Solana blockchain in the past but continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new tools are rolling out on a continuous basis to make the network more resilient, efficient and scalable. For e.g. Firedancer 2 by Jump Crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of Aave v3 deployment on Neon EVM was also recently mentioned by Stani and contributing teams like Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). Tweet by Stani 26, Tweet by Marc Zeller 25\n\nAdditionally, Neon EVM also recently announced the launch of Neon Points Program 10 to attract users and builders to accelerate the adoption of the network. We will include Aave in our points program to incentivize user activity on Aave v3 on Neon EVM with boosted points.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Mainnet with limited deployment of initial assets and conservative risk parameters.This approach will enable Aave to strategically establish a presence in the Solana ecosystem while minimizing risk exposure.\n\nThe proposal suggests three collaterals (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL 1) and one borrowable asset (USDC) with no isolated mode, e-mode enabled for correlated assets (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL), conservative LTV and supply, borrow caps. If this proposal is to pass, we will conduct a comprehensive technical risk assessment for the suggested assets at the ARFC phase to determine their risk parameters. We also invite risk service providers and community members to provide their analysis.\n\n# Infraestructure\n\n- Documentation: [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/quick_start)\n\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Neon EVM supports almost all standards. Here is the link to supported JSON-RPC - [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods)\n\n- Indexers: theGraph\n\n- Oracles: Chainlink, Pyth\n\n- Wallets: Metamask, Ledger and support other EVM network wallets.\n\n- Block explorers: [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/),  [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/)\n\n- Address formatting: It is the same as the standard Ethereum address.\n\n- On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Friendly fork of Gnosis Safe.\n\n- Cross-chain Interactions: [deBridge](https://debridge.finance/) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance/status/1737812739320599032), expected to go live on Mainnet in January)\n\n- NeonPass: NeonPass links Solana and Neon EVM to provide a smoother EVM-compatibility experience for end users (https://neonpass.live/). NeonPass is the revolving door of liquidity between Solana and Neon EVM. NeonPass is not a bridge connecting two separate blockchain ecosystems. Rather, it acts as a two-way transfer tool for bringing assets in and out of the Neon EVM platform, which itself is a Solana smart contract directly connected to the network.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Neon Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Neon Foundation and holds SOL, NEON tokens.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM and proceed with Snapshot if positive.\n\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n# Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "![IMG_4368](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkHeXxqNkg.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nTokenLogic proposes to renew our engagement with the Aave DAO  for 1 year from the 15th December 2024 when our current stream ends.\n\nTokenLogic is to provide the following services to the DAO. \n\n- Treasury and Runway Management;\n- Analytics and Performance Metrics;\n- GHO's growth across DeFi and CeFi; and,\n- Support Aave protocol parameter optimisation.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## What to Expect\n\n### Treasury and Runway Management\n\n**Asset Management & Financial Security**\n\nA central area of focus for the Finance Services Provider is to ensure that the DAO’s expenses and strategic initiatives are funded efficiently and without delay. Through the Steward role, or the standard governance process when required, TokenLogic will prioritize maintaining the DAO’s financial stability by ensuring a runway that exceeds six months of its burn rate while optimizing capital efficiency.\n\nKey components of this objective include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds across networks;\n* Providing AAVE & GHO Protocol-Owned-Liquidity (POL);\n* Allocating assets for capital efficiency, integrating yield bearing assets to the treasury;\n* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3, and between Aave v3 markets;\n* Swapping assets to align expenses with holdings.\n\n### Analytics and Performance metrics\n\nTokenLogic is establishing itself as the definitive hub for all Aave Protocol and GHO-related data via the [Aave Portal](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/). This initiative will be continuously developed and expanded throughout the year, providing access to key metrics on protocol performance, health, GHO dynamics, and market analysis.\n\nTransparency, analytics, and reporting are at the core of this effort, ensuring a clear understanding of the protocol’s financial status and overall performance. The Aave Portal will serve as an important tool for informed decision-making and in-depth analysis of the Aave ecosystem.\n\nTo further engage and educate the community, this initiative will be complemented by detailed threads/articles released throughout the mandate, promoting awareness and understanding of the platform’s developments.\n\n### GHO Adoption\n\n**Oversight**\n\nThe year 2025 will mark the second year of GHO, solidifying its strength and utility within the ecosystem. This milestone year is set to be a pivotal period of expansion for GHO, as it continues to expand to other networks and remains a cornerstone of the protocol’s revenue model.\n\nAs GHO Stewards, TokenLogic will oversee critical configurations, including the Borrow Rate, GSM Caps and Fees, ensuring optimal functionality and sustainability. In our role as Treasury Managers, we will strategically manage GHO swaps to maintain a robust and stable peg, reinforcing GHO’s position as a key asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nWe will continue to spearhead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), with a primary focus on managing liquidity, introducing POL from the Treasury, coordination GHO's launch on other networks (excl. Gnosis) and driving integrations across diverse protocols.\n\nOur key responsibilities include:\n\n- Strategically adjusting liquidity incentives to ensure robust market depth;\n- Designing and implementing direct liquidity incentive programs;\n- Leading initiatives to enhance GHO’s utility and adoption;\n- Optimizing the deployment of the DAO’s strategic voting assets;\n- Supporting future GHO facilitator programs;\n- Deploying aToken GSMs;\n- Deploying GHO liquidity from the Treasury;\n- Facilitating GHO integration into centralized exchanges, fund management platforms, and the broader DeFi ecosystem; and,\n- Support teams seeking to attain a line of credit within the upcoming Emergence instance.\n\n**Parameter Configuration**\n\nTokenLogic will continue to provide detailed insights into GHO's performance and provide parameter recommendations that prioritise price stability whilst balancing the DAO's growth ambitions. \n\nStrategic focus will be placed on managing the borrow rate and peg relationship to maintain the resilience of the peg by retaining funds within the GSMs, whilst promoting the ongoing use of GHO within evolving market dynamics.\n\nThe Aave Portal will provide insights into the impact of the parameter adjustments to curate an environment that promotes sustainable growth, adoption and aligns with Aave's broader financial goals. \n\nThe TokenLogic team will collaborate closely with other service providers to create balanced, effective solutions that benefit the protocol as a whole.\n\n### Aave Protocol\n\nThe evolution of the Aave protocol, including updates to Aave v4, the deployment of Umbrella, and the launch of new Aave markets, will bring transformative changes to the protocol’s operations. Our proposal focuses on providing the financial planning and management essential for navigating these developments and ensuring smooth integration within the broader ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, we will support the adaptation of Aave’s tokenomics to meet the requirements of Umbrella and the introduction of new staking pools. Through proactive collaboration, strategic guidance, and consultation, we are committed to ensuring these updates are implemented seamlessly and positioned for long-term success.\n\n# Terms\n\n* 12-month engagement, December 15th 2024 to December 15th 2025; and,\n* 1,000,000 GHO streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n\n# Specification\n\nTo support funding the streams, the following is to be performed:\n\n* 0.75M GHO deposited Prime instance;\n* 0.75M aEthUSDC swapped to GHO; and,\n* GHO from swap sent to Treasury.\n\nCreate the following stream allowing TokenLogic to withdraw GHO from the Prime instance.\n\nStream: 1,000,000 GHO over 365 days\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nThe stream shall commence the next block from when the previous stream finishes.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond the Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic does provide data analytics services to Gearbox. This commitment does not interfere with our responsibilities to the Aave DAO. \n\nWe conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
