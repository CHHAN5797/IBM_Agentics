        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Aave V3 Deployment on Celo\nDate: 2024-05-09\nAuthor: @pennblockchain, @Isha - Isha Varshney (Celo Foundation)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave on Celo to expand Aave real-world lending and green asset collateral to users around the world, with the provision of rewards to bootstrap liquidity.\n\n## Abstract:\n\nUpon approval by the Aave community, Aave will be deployed on Celo with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including CELO, USDC, USDT, cUSD and cEUR. This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and Celo communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems. This deployment will be incentivized by the tune of $3M over 3 years (with option to extend) by Celo Foundation directly or through ecosystem partners.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nDeploying Aave on Celo presents potential benefits for both Aave and Celo ecosystems. The Celo ecosystem offers a unique value proposition featuring real-world usage and ReFi. As Aave will be given a prominent role on Celo, this deployment offers Aave differentiated expansion and revenue opportunities. For more details on Celo’s real-world usage and key features, please refer to the [temp check](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-v3-deployment-on-celo/14385).\n\n1. A deployment on Celo expands AAVE’s utility and user base to a unique population of Celo’s mobile-first community which has [grown significantly 2](https://app.artemis.xyz/project/celo) over the past few months led by key launches that have brought in returning real-world users in emerging markets.\n2. Aave will be heavily utilized for real-world DeFi and ReFi use cases, particularly in emerging markets given Celo’s growing presence in these regions led by protocols like GoodDollar, Impact Market and the Opera Minipay wallet.\n3. The Celo Foundation directly or through ecosystem partners will allocate $3M over 3 years (with option to extend) as well as the option for Retroactive Public Goods Funding as an incentive for Aave users to support the adoption and bootstrap growth on Celo. This deployment will bring new users to the Aave platform and reach more users from the Celo community.\n4. The[ Mento protocol ](https://www.mento.org/) on Celo proposed returning 120M CELO to the Celo Community Fund, which the Celo community has expressed interest in placing in Aave to boost on-chain liquidity for CELO (pending a governance process). More details [here 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-reserve-returning-celo/5236).\n5. In the long-term, this Celo x AAVE deployment has the potential opportunity to expand into RWA tokens, natural capital-backed assets such as tokenized carbon credit and other ReFi assets (conditional upon rigorous liquidity and credit assessments by Chaos Labs and others) etc.\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave on Celo with the following assets for collateral: CELO, USDC, USDT, cUSD and cEUR.\n\nThe table below combines both risk managers’ suggested risk parameters for each asset previously submitted. The highlighted values are Gauntlet’s more liberal recommendations. Over time, we expect we can continue to increase caps as the Celo blockchain grows through the development of more real-world use cases and the transition to an L2 on Ethereum.\n\n|Risk Parameters|WETH|USDC|CELO|cUSD|||\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|NO|YES|||\n|Enable Borrow|YES|YES|YES|YES|||\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|NO|YES|||\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|||\n|Loan To Value|80%|75%|N/A|70%|||\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|80%|N/A|75%|||\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|N/A|5%|||\n|Reserve Factor|15%|10%|15%|10%|||\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|10%|10%|||\n|Borrow Cap|300|2,000,000|1,000,000|3,400,000|||\n|Supply Cap|300|2,000,000|1,000,000|4,300,000|||\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|N/A|TBD|||\n|uOptimal|80%|80%|45%|75%|||\n|Base|1%|0%|0%|0%|||\n|Slope1|3.8%|4%|7%|5%|||\n|Slope2|80%|60%|300%|75%|||\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|Disabled|Disabled|||\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|13.00%|13.00%|13.00%|||\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|300.00%|300.00%|300.00%|||\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|3.00%|3.00%|3.00%|||\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|5.00%|5.00%|5.00%|||\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|20.00%|20.00%|20.00%|||\n|Flashloanable|YES|YES|YES|YES|||\n|Siloed Borrowing|NO|NO|NO|NO|||\n|Borrowed in Isolation|NO|YES|NO|NO|||\n\n## Deployment Checklist:\n\n* Feedback from both risk service providers\n* BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation Report \n* Oracle recommendation: \n* The graph support\n* Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nFranklin DAO is not compensated in any form by Celo or creating this ARFC proposal.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Activate and Deploy GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-27\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis proposal aims to establish a dedicated Safety Module for GHO, Aave's native stablecoin, on Arbitrum, to enhance the security and stability of the Aave Protocol.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module (GSM) will be similar to the existing Aave Safety Module (SM), providing an additional layer of protection against shortfall events and incentivizing stakeholders through rewards by using and staking GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nDeploying the GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum aligns with Aave's strategic goals of fostering a secure and scalable environment for its stablecoin. This proposal leverages Arbitrum's technological advantages and financial incentives, setting a solid foundation for GHO's growth and stability.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe [GHO Safety Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635) was created with the aim of mitigating risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events, thereby fortifying the Aave Protocol’s resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversified the Safety Module’s capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nCreating a GHO SM on Arbitrum responds to several factors:\n\n1. Scalability and low fees\n2. Strong Ecosystem and Liquidity injection\n\nCreating a GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum will ensure support and liquidity for GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nTo provide more context, Aave DAO recently received a Long Term Incentive Pilot Program Grant of 750K ARB from Arbitrum DAO, in order to expand GHO into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe funds would be used as follows:\n\n- 375K ARB distributed over a 12-week period amounts to around 1% additional yield to users. While this could be higher, it will be meaningful enough to make ETH and GHO borrows sufficiently attractive to boost TVL and borrow metrics.\n- 375K ARB used for GHO liquidity mining rewards. To target a sufficient size of GHO liquidity on the network, reward rates will need to be similar to mainnet. The GHO Liquidity Committee has used a mix of incentives to keep GHO at peg. We expect that a similar yield will be needed to manage the GHO peg on Arbitrum.\n\nTogether, these two uses of the grant funds should increase TVL and borrowing demand on Arbitrum. Arbitrum will be one of the most attractive networks to borrow on Aave due to the borrowing incentives. It will be the most appealing L2 to borrow and use GHO when it goes cross-chain.\n\nAnother example is the recent approval by Aave DAO of the [GHO Cross-Chain Launch strategy for the GHO](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2a6ffbcff41a5ef98b7542f99b207af9c1e79e61f859d0a62f3bf52d3280877a) stablecoin, the native asset of the Aave Protocol, beginning with the initial expansion to the Arbitrum network. This expansion will utilize the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).\n\n### **Specification**\n\n1. **Deployment of GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum**:\n    - Establish the GHO SM smart contracts on Arbitrum to manage and protect GHO assets.\n    - Integrate Chainlink oracles for accurate and reliable price feeds.\n2. **Incentive Program**:\n    - Utilize ARB incentives to bootstrap GHO liquidity and adoption on Arbitrum.\n    - Implement liquidity mining programs and other yield strategies to attract and retain GHO holders.\n3. **Merit Incentive Program**:\n    - Stakeholders who participate in staking GHO on Arbitrum will be eligible for Merit rewards. The Merit program is designed to incentivize both borrowing and staking GHO. The rewards will enhance user participation and the overall security of the GHO ecosystem on Arbitrum.\n\n### Useful Links:\n\n[**[ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO**](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635)\n\n**[Aave LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a4d8072fce74d8fc069cf0ca33fb6348e3aa66ab6369dd3dbcaaff01f2cebbd)**\n\n**[[Aave] LTIPP Application](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741)**\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nACI is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not being compensated for creating this TEMP CHECK.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.

EUR stablecoins, in particular, are underrepresented in the ecosystem, and onboarding stEUR can help bridge this gap.\n  \n- **Growth in a Controlled Environment**: While stEUR and agEUR have relatively small market caps (5M$ and 20M$ respectively), onboarding stEUR as a collateral-only asset with limited caps will allow it to grow in a controlled environment, minimizing risks for the Aave protocol.\n\n- **Collateral Potential**: stEUR, being a staked version of a decentralized EUR-peg stablecoin, presents a promising collateral candidate for Aave.\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Asset**: stEUR\n- **Contract Address**: 0x004626A008B1aCdC4c74ab51644093b155e59A23\n\n### Price Feed\n\nFor the price feed, we propose implementing a price adapter that calculates the value of stEUR based on the value of agEUR/USD and the exchange rate of agEUR/stEUR.\n\nThis replicates precedents such as with [sDAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x29081f7aB5a644716EfcDC10D5c926c5fEe9F72B#code).\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nWe propose the following parameters for stEUR onboarding:\n\n| Parameter             | Value       |\n|-----------------------|-------------|\n| Isolation Mode        | No          |\n| Borrowable            | No          |\n| Borrowable in Iso     | No          |\n| Stable Borrowing      | No          |\n| Collateral Enabled    | Yes         |\n| Supply Cap (stEUR)    | 3,000,000   |\n| Borrow Cap (stEUR)    | 0           |\n| Debt Ceiling          | N/A         |\n| LTV                   | 70%         |\n| LT                    | 75%         |\n| LB                    | 8%          |\n| LPF                   | 10%         |\n| Reserve Factor        | 20%         |\n| Base Rate             | 0%          |\n| Slope 1               | 8%          |\n| Slope 2               | 80%         |\n| Optimal Ratio         | 80%         |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provided feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Angle for creating this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "[TEMP CHECK] Onboard pufETH to Aave V3 Core Instance\nDate: 2025-01-23\nAuthor: Amir (Puffer Finance)\nSummary\n\nPuffer Finance (https://www.puffer.fi/) proposes adding pufETH as a collateral asset in Aave’s Ethereum V3 market. pufETH is a liquid restaking token that enables users to earn both Ethereum staking rewards and additional returns through restaking on EigenLayer. Its growing adoption, deep liquidity, and robust security measures make pufETH a strong candidate to enhance Aave’s asset offerings and attract additional liquidity.\n\nBackground\npufETH is the liquid staking token of Puffer Finance, the only premissionless liquid restaking protocol built on Ethereum. By leveraging EigenLayer’s restaking capabilities, pufETH allows users to participate in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with as little as 2 ETH, offering enhanced returns and decentralized validator participation.\n\nKey highlights of pufETH and Puffer Finance include:\n\nGrant:\n\nEthereum Foundation for developing Secure-Signer\nInnovative design\n\nLeading anti-slashing design for AVSs and validators\nFirst preconfirmation AVS on EigenLayer with 2.8M ETH of economic security\nHigh Adoption and TVL:\n\nPuffer Finance holds over $279 million (~80K ETH) in total value locked (TVL) within its ecosystem, with an additional $141 million integrated across DeFi platforms like Curve, Pendle, and Karak.\n\nPuffer has established approxmiately $11 million pools of pufETH on Curve (Curve.fi)\nSecurity and Trust:\n\nPuffer has been audited by 10 leading firms and employs Secure-Signer technology and anti-slashing mechanisms to safeguard user funds and validators.\nSix security partners audit Puffer’s code base.\n\nPermissionless Participation:\n\nPuffer’s anti-slashing technology allows for permissionless and decentralized validator participation, ensuring robust network security while reducing slashing risks.\n\nStrong Industry Backing:\n\nPuffer Finance is supported by top-tier investors such as Binance Labs, F-Prime, Franklin Templeton, and Coinbase Ventures.\n\nBenefits for Aave\nYield Opportunities:\n\nBy listing pufETH, Aave users can earn Ethereum staking and restaking rewards in addition to traditional borrowing and lending income. This enhances capital efficiency and provides a competitive advantage over other lending platforms.\n\nSecurity and Transparency:\n\nPuffer Finance’s advanced security measures and transparent on-chain operations ensure a high level of trust and reliability for borrowers and lenders.\n\nDiversification and Market Growth:\n\nAdding pufETH as the only permissionless LRT allows Aave to diversify its collateral offerings, catering to a growing demand for liquid staking assets. This can further increase Aave’s TVL and protocol activity.\n\nIncentives\nTo encourage user participation and support the listing of pufETH on Aave, the Puffer Finance Foundation proposes:\n\nGovernance Incentives:\n\nAllocating up to 10% of Puffer’s $CARROT (Puffer’s onchain incentives) token supply to incentivize borrowers and lenders interacting with pufETH on Aave. These incentives will reward early adopters and help seed liquidity in the pufETH market.\n\nBorrowing and Supplying Rewards:\n\nA portion of the $CARROT token incentives will be distributed to users borrowing against or supplying pufETH on Aave, enhancing protocol activity and adoption.\n\nSpecification\nDetails of the onboarding of the asset will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\nToken Contracts\nEthereum: 0xd9a442856c234a39a81a089c06451ebaa4306a72\nChainlink Feed\n0xDe3f7Dd92C4701BCf59F47235bCb61e727c45f80\nConclusion\nListing pufETH on Aave represents a significant opportunity to integrate a highly liquid and secure restaking token into Aave’s ecosystem. By offering additional yield opportunities, diversifying collateral assets, and providing robust security, pufETH can contribute to Aave’s growth and strengthen its position as a leader in DeFi lending markets.\n\nThe Puffer Finance team is committed to collaborating with Aave’s risk assessment partners and the community to ensure a smooth and compliant listing process.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\nDisclaimer\nCurrent proposal has been edited by ACI, as this proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI did not received payment for proposal edition and is not affiliated with Puffer Finance.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "## Author: Polygon Community Treasury Board\n\n## Date: 2024-01-16\n\n---\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe Polygon Community Treasury Board proposes a strategic initiative to restore relationships and strengthen ties between the Polygon and Aave communities, and drive new growth of Aave on Polygon PoS. The following proposal introduces a $3M joint liquidity incentive program that seeks to enhance liquidity and adoption of Aave on the Polygon PoS chain, and re-align our respective communities. This proposal is being put forth by the Polygon CTB, which is external from Polygon Labs and acts on behalf of the Polygon community and ecosystem.\n\n**Motivation**\n\n**Long History of Success of Aave on Polygon PoS**\n\nThere is no debate that Aave’s deployment on Polygon in early 2021 is what kickstarted the multichain revolution, and since then, the collaboration between our two ecosystems has yielded tremendous results. With Polygon’s high throughput and low transaction costs complementing Aave’s robust lending and borrowing infrastructure, we have witnessed exponential growth of Aave TVL on Polygon:\n\n* Aave v2 on Polygon PoS reached $3.5Bn+ TVL at its peak.\n* Aave v3 on Polygon PoS reached $450M+ TVL at its peak ($335M TVL as of 1/14/24).\n* Polygon and Aave, together with so many other protocols and community members, were able to contribute to the first successful high-scalability ecosystem on Ethereum. This was a proof of concept that led to many of the amazing innovations happening across the current, very healthy Ethereum scaling landscape. Polygon, with the Aave community’s amazing support, was able to prove having a scalable and affordable extension to Ethereum was not just a dream, but the future of Ethereum. We would like to continue to work together to build this future with many more firsts.\n* Polygon is the 2nd largest in ‘Cumulative Fees’ on all Aave chain deployments per Defillama https://defillama.com/protocol/aave#fees-revenue*\n\n![|624x347](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdVwuN_3egwe5XHO74FW9o9hUWwZcRuFIzKjJzW3uDNxWbkPboeVo05HLcTSdrxAswW0u-AvOsjV-mH1E31XKOlpK33Egt5Zc5zeMtm12CK5jS3YCh1Ptfd-xUYl-Vm1Y4WDbp8?key=C_JBaU7orRyycW2kn5ufnkpZ)\n\n* Aave users on Polygon are continuing to grow, despite the lack of an incentive program. There are clearly many users in the community that are choosing to use Aave on Polygon. We have noticed that many of these users come to Aave with Polygon as their first experience. https://dune.com/queries/4573060/7624783\n\n![|624x313](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdXen7UyFO53LKjoEFIYy8xjb0q7ZVNxjivlHDGMsIGU2Ad4c2vRaoxxKndIk1bPGwlfutCUM485ubggX7BdANPWLciByXFUM1ebj-Ca4ui3rdj1jU2H4vBYccNZj3hxhiiIGRs?key=C_JBaU7orRyycW2kn5ufnkpZ)\n\n* I think this video may help people to remember how close our communities used to be. The video is with Stani, Sandeep, Mark Cuban, myself and Justin Wu. This was actually supposed to be an in-person conference, but Covid sort of messed that up: https://youtu.be/oaMBAl51P2Y?si=7RCmQniHacvDtJwG\n\n![|624x233](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfCJGrk5ZZkUv2aJwPmJG1VTXdUP6NAeThHJ4PwNe7Dh6iUk9NAfFp8L43bV8cgC_RKfyPgCfw7WyyBYl8W_wtlvNT5QfxBTJ_PkXAOx5tkmqgmLt0w8267uCPVgJxRyoISykBB?key=C_JBaU7orRyycW2kn5ufnkpZ)\n\n**Status of Aave on Polygon PoS**\n\nDecember’s [Pre-PIP](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-polygon-pos-bridge-liquidity-program/20284) (aka “Stake the Bridge”) received strong engagement from both the Polygon and Aave communities and resulted in the pre-proposal being rejected. The following discourse amongst community members and back-and-forth between leaders from each respective protocol point to a future where Aave is not usable on Polygon PoS. Stakeholders emphasize that this future should not be today in order to protect users, but that it could, or should, be tomorrow:\n\nAnalysis from [Llama Risk](https://governance.aave.com/u/llamarisk/summary), Aave’s risk manager:\n\n3. Considering the current sentiment indicating the Polygon pre-PIP proposal is unlikely to proceed, we recommend no immediate changes to Aave Polygon market parameters are necessary as the risk profile remains unchanged.\n\n4. Should Aave DAO opt to reduce network exposure, we recommend a measured and gradual approach to protect both users and dependent protocols (e.g., some Curve pools use A-tokens on Polygon).\n\nCommentary from [EzR3aL](https://governance.aave.com/u/ezr3al/summary), a very active and long-time Aave community member:\n\n* Aave user on Polygon shouldn’t be the affected ones by this vote and should have time to act accordingly.\n\nSo my proposal would be, instead of moving away from Polygon immediately by changing parameter drastically, I would suggest the DAO simply stops business there over time. This means we don’t raise caps anymore, we don’t add new assets, we raise the RF over time and encourage user to move to other chains, as there were already a few comments from those chains where they would incentivize this. That way user have enough time to adjust their loans without getting rekt on day one. We keep the market functional as long as needed but don’t invest more time and money into it.\n\nWe are concerned with the feedback shown above:\n\n* Not only does the community believe that Aave should not increase supply caps, but that it should decrease them, eliminating hopes for any future growth\n* Removing potential listings for future assets is a lose-lose for both communities, as users will miss out on future blue-chip assets coming to Polygon\n* Raising RF’s over time will make Aave unusable practically for Polygon PoS users\n\nThere is additional commentary from other community members, risk managers, and Aave leaders that further support our concerns of the existing trajectory.\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Pre-PIP: Polygon PoS Bridge Liquidity Program - Proposal Ideas](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-polygon-pos-bridge-liquidity-program/20284)\n\n[[ARFC] Adjust Risk Parameters for Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon - Governance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-adjust-risk-parameters-for-aave-v2-and-v3-on-polygon/20211)\n\n[AAVE - DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/aave#information)\n\n**Specification**\n\n**Proposal for Joint Incentives**\n\nTo build on previous success and address the evolving needs of both our communities and the market at-large, the Polygon Community Treasury Board proposes a “Joint Liquidity Incentive Program” featuring a combined $3M of incentives:\n\n* Polygon Contribution: $1.5M USD in POL tokens from the Polygon Community Treasury\n* Aave Contribution: $1.5M USD in AAVE tokens from the Aave Treasury\n\nThe combined incentives would be used for the following:\n\n1. Liquidity Incentives: Attracting new users and liquidity providers to Aave on Polygon PoS by offering competitive rewards.\n2. Protocol Growth: Retaining and enhancing the utility of POL and AAVE tokens while driving adoption of Aave v3 on Polygon PoS.\n\nThe combined $3M of incentives could be distributed to Aave users on Polygon PoS over the course of the next 4 months. This could result in an incentive APR of 3-4% for lenders, and 1-2% incentive APR for borrowers.\n\n**The Need for Joint Incentives**\n\nGiven the Aave Community is in the AFRC stage with both [Mantle](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-aave-v3-on-mantle/20542) and [Sonic](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-aave-v3-on-sonic/20543), who will each provide eight figures of liquidity incentives, along with additional discussions with other chains, we believe that a program of this size is needed in order to provide competitive rates to other markets. Furthermore, we believe that this proposal needs to move along swiftly given that other proposals seem to be in final stages that will target the migration of liquidity from Polygon PoS to Aave markets on other chains.\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[[ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on Sonic - Governance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-aave-v3-on-sonic/20543)\n\n[[ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on Mantle - Governance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-aave-v3-on-mantle/20542)\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is being submitted by Roc Zacharias, who is on the Polygon Community Treasury Board (CTB), which oversees the Polygon Community Grants Program (CGP); on behalf of the CTB and Polygon community. Roc Zacharias is not an employee of Polygon Labs, and the CTB operates on the community's behalf. This proposal has been voted ‘Yes’ by the members of the CTB with a majority vote pending results of this joint proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nShould this proposal gain the support of the Aave DAO, we envision the following steps:\n\n1. Token Allocation: Disbursement of $1.5M in POL and AAVE tokens into a multisig wallet managed by representatives from both communities.\n2. Liquidity Program Design: Finalize the specifics of the incentive program, ensuring transparency, inclusivity, and measurable KPIs.\n3. Deployment and Monitoring: Launch the program, actively monitor its progress, and adjust strategies based on performance metrics and community feedback.\n\nThe proposal is more than just a funding request; it represents a renewed commitment to collaboration, signaling that Polygon and Aave have put previous differences aside in order to prioritize the long-term growth and success of our ecosystems. By leveraging combined strengths, we can create a lasting impact that benefits not only Aave and Polygon, but also the broader decentralized ecosystem and its users.\n\nWe invite the Aave DAO and Polygon governance participants to engage in an open dialogue, share their thoughts, and ultimately support this initiative. Together, let’s build a brighter future for DeFi. Whatever happens, in the end I hope our communities can stay friends, regardless of how this all turns out.\n\nWith all of our Love,\n\nRoc\nPolygon Community Treasury Board\n\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
