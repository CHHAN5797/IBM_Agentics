Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.\n\nWith market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.\n\nDo note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.\n\n| Asset | Current RF| Recommended RF | \n| ---  | ---    |---     |\n| 1INCH| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| AMPL | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BUSD | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BAL  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| BAT  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CRV  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CVX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| DAI  | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| DPI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENS  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENJ  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FEI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FRAX | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| GUSD | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| KNC  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| LINK | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| LUSD | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| MANA | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| MKR  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| RAI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| REN  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| renFIL| 35.00%| 99.99% |\n| SNX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| sUSD | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| SUSHI| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| TUSD | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| UNI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| USDC | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| USDP | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| USDT | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| UST  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| wBTC | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| wETH | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| YFI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ZRX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal.

User's funds are not at risk of liquidation and the borrowing rate remains unchanged. \n\nBy progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on v2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to v3.\n\nOf the assets that are currently frozen, with the exception of BAL, the RF is to be increaed to 99.99%. Around $680k of users positions, CRV, DPI, GHST and LINK will receive near zero deposit yield. This represents less than 0.5% of Aave v2's TVL. The highest deposit yield of these assets at the time of writing is 0.21%. This change will have minimal affect. \n\nThe remaining assets are to receive an incremental 5% increase in the RF. After implementing this publication, user elasticity shall be assessed and the impact of the updates before moving forward with additional increases. \n\nThere shall be a minimum gap of 2 weeks between each subsequent update. Target AIP submission date is week commencing 31st July, ain 3 weeks time.  \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated:\n\n|Asset|Current RF |Proposed RF |\n|---|---|---|\n|DAI|21.00%|26.00%|\n|USDC|23.00%|28.00%|\n|USDT|22.00%|27.00%|\n|wBTC|55.00%|60.00%|\n|wETH|45.00%|50.00%|\n|MATIC|41.00%|46.00%|\n|BAL|32.00%|37.00%|\n|CRV|38.00%|99.99%|\n|GHST|60.00%|99.99%|\n|LINK|50.00%|99.99%|\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2) If consensus is reached, submit the first Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n3) Subsequent increments will be done directly through an AIP to reduce the governance overhead.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe author, TokenLogic, receives payment indirectly from [Aave Grant DAO](https://twitter.com/AaveGrants) via [Butter](https://twitter.com/butterymoney) as part of the [Incentivised Delegate Campaign](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732).

This publication proposes reducing the Slope1 parameter from 6.10% to 5.00%. The 5.00% Slope1 parameter marginally exceeds the the current borrow rate and the two dominants LST APRs.\n\nv3 wMATIC Borrow Rate: [4.74% APY](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3) (at time of writing)\nMaticX APR: [4.68%](https://www.staderlabs.com/polygon/stake/)\nstMATIC APR: [4.30%](https://lido.fi/)\n\nWith the current borrowing rate for wMATIC, 4.74% APY, it exceeds the LST yield. As a result, users are not generating a positive return on looping the LST and wMATIC. Reducing the Slope1 to 5.00%, keeping utilisation constant, the borrow rate APY is reduced to 3.87%. At this level, the yield maximising strategy become profitable. Reducing the Slope1 parameter is the most effective way to stimulate wMATIC borrowing demand.\n\nLowering the Slope1 parameter will increase the utilisation of the wMATIC reserve. The new equilibrium scenarios are shown below:\n\n* Borrow rate 4.30% supports utilisation of 63.10%\n* Borrow rate 4.68% supports utilisation of 68.55%\n* Borrow rate 4.74% supports utilisation of 69.50%\n\nFor each equilibrium scenario above, the Aave DAO's revenue increases. \n\nReducing the Slope1 to 5.00%, keeping utilisation constant, the deposit rate falls to 1.74% on v3. This compares favourably to the 0.53% deposit rate on v2. As a result, we do not expect to see any migration from v3 to v2 and propose no changes to the v2 wMATIC interest rate strategy.\n\n# Specification\n\nUpdate the interest rate strategy as per below:\n\nwMATIC Address: [`0x0d500B1d8E8eF31E21C99d1Db9A6444d3ADf1270`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270)\n\nvariableRateSlope1: From 6.10% to 5.00%\n\nAll other parameters remain the same as the [existing interest rate strategy](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xFB0898dCFb69DF9E01DBE625A5988D6542e5BdC5#code).\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @scottincrypto\nDated: 2022-12-17 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend BAL interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3 and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere is currently a high demand for borrowing BAL (interest rate = 28.18% on Polygon v3) across all Reserves. The BAL liquidity pools offer poor capital efficiency, with the utilization of the Reserve ([48.27%](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x9a71012b13ca4d3d0cdc72a177df3ef03b0e76a3&marketName=proto_polygon_v3) on Polygon v3) often near the Optimal point of 45%.\n\nBy changing the interest rate curve across all three active Liquidity Pools, this proposal is expected to improve capital efficiency by lowering interest rates on markets where borrowing is disabled and enticing capital to move to where borrowing demand generates an attractive yield. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and generate significant capital efficiency within the BAL Reserves.\n\nDue to the ongoing incentives offered by Aura Finance, any new deposits are expected to be borrowed. Users are able to borrow and deposit BAL into [Aura Finance’s staking contract](https://app.aura.finance/) to earn a yield of around 45% at the time of writing. This creates an arbitrage opportunity of 16.82% taking into account the liquidation risk, auraBAL peg and additional Smart Contract risk.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUsers are expected to continue borrowing BAL to earn yield whilst interest rates permit and, in doing so, will create ongoing borrowing demand for BAL. Changing the interest rate curve by amending the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will improve the capital efficiency of Reserves. However, with borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it is rational for profit driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield.\n\nThe three charts below show the most recent 5 month historical BAL interest rate across each BAL Reserve. The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 28.18% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14% which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pyLdQvS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6sNc6ku.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eAG1lOG.png)\n\nIn addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at 0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a BAL interest rate similar to the SNX interest rate curve which has a base 3%, slope 1 12% and slope 2 100%.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b3kks7y.png)\n\nUtilization of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 73.33% assuming users can borrow BAL and are willing to pay an interest rate of 13%, which is less than the current borrowing rate of 28.18%. With a borrowing cost of 14% at the Optimal point, depositing BAL into Aura Finance’s auraBAL staking contract or B-80BAL-20wETH / auraBAL gauge will remain lucrative for users. If the utilization exceeds the Uoptimal point, a follow up proposal will propose increasing the interest rate further.\n\nThe improved capital efficiency of the BAL Reserve is expected to lead to an increase in BAL liquidity on-chain. The more on-chain liquidity there is, the more expensive it is to manipulate an oracle feed. Based upon the @ChaosLabs Borrow Cap formula, Llama proposes increasing the Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 from  96,798.00 units to 256,140.00 units.\n\nWith respect to the Polygon v3 deployment, assuming the BAL Reserve remains at $979,230, the revenue generated at the Optimal point for the DAO will increase from $6.17k to $20.4k, or 230%. The Reserve utilization increases from 45% to 80%, which reduces the amount of unused BAL by 63.6%. This will provide a significant increase in capital efficiency.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the BAL Interest Rate on Ethereum v2, Polygon v2 and Polygon v3.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nThe below shows the proposed changes to the Borrow Cap on Polygon v3.\n\n|Polygon Parameter| Units |\n| --- | --- | \n| Supply Cap | 284,600 (no change)|\n| Borrow Cap | 256,140 |\n\nBorrow Cap is calculated: \n(Uoptimal + 0.1) x SupplyCap\n(0.8+0.1) x 284,600 = 256,140\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0\\(https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
