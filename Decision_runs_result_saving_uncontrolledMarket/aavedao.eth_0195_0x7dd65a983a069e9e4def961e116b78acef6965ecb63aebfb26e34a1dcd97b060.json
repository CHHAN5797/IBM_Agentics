        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-26\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\nThis proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nArtemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 30.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Website](https://artemisfinance.io)\n\n[X](https://x.com/Artemisfinance)\n\nDocuments:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/)\n\nAudit Report:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit)\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "## [ARFC]  Deploy a Lido Aave v3 Instance\n\n## Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-06-24\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThis proposal suggests joining the Lido Alliance as the Aave DAO and deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on the Lido ecosystem.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAave and Lido have historically seen symbiotic growth, with stETH being one of the premier collaterals on Aave and leveraged staking being one of the most profitable use cases for both Aave DAO and Lido users.\n\nLido is in the process of launching the Lido Alliance, which will reward novel use cases of staked ETH and support further growth of the Lido ecosystem. This ARFC proposal suggests that Aave supports Lido Alliance efforts by deploying a new Aave V3 ETH market for Lido. This Aave v3 instance will be designed and tuned to support stETH leverage loopers. The deployment will only include wstETH and wETH assets with E-Mode enabled.\n\nLido has committed incentive programs and ecosystem support for this instance in order to bootstrap liquidity and promote additional programs within the Lido Alliance.\n\nThis market will be bootstrapped with wETH from the Ahab program to attract wETH liquidity.\n\nwETH suppliers will also be proposed to be eligible to a dedicated Merit Boost\n\nIncentives from Lido will be detailed ahead of the AIP deployment. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe Lido Alliance’s Aave v3 instance implements the following:\n\n- The borrow cap of wETH will be set to 90% of supplied wETH, with updates tightly controlled by the risk steward. This will ensure that stETH/wETH loops are consistently profitable and can't go into negative territory.\n- E-Mode LTV & LT are set 50 bps above all other Aave implementations, making it the most efficient loop venue in the industry.\n- For the first 6 months of the Lido Alliance Aave v3, wETH slope1 will be set at 2.50%, ((currently 2.7% on mainnet and on L2s) and wETH RF set at 10% (currently 15% on all markets). This will make it the most profitable venue to loop stETH & wETH.\n- wstETH RF will be 5%.\n\nThe deployment of the Aave V3 Lido Ecosystem Aave will be done by Catapulta on behalf of the Aave DAO.\n\n|Parameter|wstETH value|wETH value|\n|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|650K|900K|\n|Borrow Cap|12k|810K|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|NA|\n|LTV|80.00%|82.00%|\n|LT|81.00%|83.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|6%|5%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|3.5%|2.50%|\n|Variable Slope2|85%|85%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|5.00%|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|Disabled|\n|Flahloanable|Yes|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|No|\n|E-Mode|Yes|Yes|\n|E-Mode LTV|93.5%|93.5%|\n|E-Mode LT|95.5%|95.5%|\n|E-mode Liquidation Bonus|1%|1 %|\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nLido Alliance proposal: https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-alliance-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem/7475\n\n https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/17930\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Lido and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.

        "body": "### **[ARFC] Onboard ezETH to Aave V3 Lido Instance**\n\n### **Author: Renzo Protocol & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)**\n\n### **Date: 2024-08-02**\n\n---\n\n> ARFC has been updated with Risk Parameters provided by Risk Service Providers 2024-08-12.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThis is an ARFC to continue to gauge community sentiment for adding borrow/lend support for Renzo Protocol and its Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) ezETH on AAVE V3 Ethereum, after the successful [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-ezeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/17151).\n\nTo align best with goals of all relevant stakeholders, this proposal suggests onboarding ezETH to Lido’s Aave v3 instance.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAs productive assets, staking tokens are high quality collateral to borrow against. ezETH is one of the largest liquid restaking tokens. With withdraw feature now enabled and the peg holding steady over the near term, we believe it is time to consider adding ezETH as a collateral asset. \n\nThe onboarding of ezETH will consequently create increased ezETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of ezETH.\n\nAdding ezETH to the Lido Aave v3 instance brings additional synergies for all stakeholders. \n\nezETH will add additional demand for wstETH borrowing, making the wstETH looping more favorable for the main users. Incentives from Renzo can bring additional ETH liquidity to the Lido instance, bolstering the existing liquidity mining campaigns. \n\n## **Chain to be deployed/listed**\n\nAave v3 Lido instance on Ethereum\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nRenzo will be providing 3X points multiplier for ezETH deposits, which will be the highest points multiplier available for comparable protocols. \n\n## Specification\n\nezETH: [0xbf5495Efe5DB9ce00f80364C8B423567e58d2110](https://etherscan.io/token/0xbf5495Efe5DB9ce00f80364C8B423567e58d2110)\n\n### Risk Parameters:\n\nInitial Risk Parameters haven been provided by Risk service providers during the ARFC phase and ARFC has been updated 2024-08-12.\n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 7,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 700 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\nWe recommend a **`maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent`** of 7.39% for ezETH, with a **`MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY`** of 7 days. This recommendation is based on the frequent occurrence of rate distributions and relatively minimal rate variance observed over time.\n\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7.39% | monthly | 7 days |\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[Renzo Protocol](https://www.renzoprotocol.com/)\n\n[Documentation](https://docs.renzoprotocol.com/docs)\n\n[Github](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol)\n\n[Audits](https://github.com/Renzo-Protocol/contracts-public/blob/master/Audit/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment.pdf)\n\n[Chainlink Data Feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ezeth-eth)\n\n[Composable Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659)\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-ezeth-to-aave-v3-ethereum/17151/4)\n\n[TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x4bf182cff2248f9dcaf11e6d30791fc44f9d1c5fd4116fe66903dec39ca56810)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
