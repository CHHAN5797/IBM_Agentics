The adjustments covered in the report can be seen below.\n\nThese changes are intended to aid Arbitrum in the community’s transition from USDC.e to USDC.\n\n\nYou can read our full analysis here: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gauntlets-usdc-e-initial-migration-report/15986/5?u=gauntlet\n\n\n# Specification\n\n\n\n- ‘Freeze’ the USDC.e pool.\n- Raise the USDC supply cap to 50,000,000.\n- Raise the USDC borrow cap to 45,000,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n- Gauntlet is compensated by the Arbitrum Foundation to provide recommendations to the major protocols on Arbitrum to facilitate USDC migration. These strategic migration recommendations do not fall under the scope of Gauntlet’s continuous [market risk management work](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-updated-gauntlet-aave-renewal/11013) for the Aave DAO.\n- This proposal is not meant to indicate that the Arbitrum community should mandate the actions of the multi-deployment and self-governed Aave DAO.\n- Gauntlet reserves the right to not move forward with any parameter changes recommended in Snapshot polls, if market conditions change meaningfully.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n\nBy approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nGauntlet's risk simulation platform has identified an opportunity to modify risk parameters, including Loan To Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across 5 assets on Ethereum v3, Arbitrum v3 and Ethereum v2. For more details, see the full forum post [here]( https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825/1).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThese parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations and they seek to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, the expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics shown in the [full forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gauntlet-risk-parameter-updates-for-ethereum-v3-arbitrum-v3-ethereum-v2-2023-06-26/13825) can help understand why some parameter recommendations have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for the recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).\n\n## Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at reasonable levels while optimizing for capital efficiency. Our simulations show that we can improve the balance of risk and capital efficiency by making the parameter changes specified below.\n\nEthereum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|DAI Loan to Value |67%|77%\n|USDC Liquidation Threshold|79%|80%\n|WSTETH Liquidation Bonus|7%|6%\n\nArbitrum Aave v3 Parameter Changes Specification\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|LINK Liquidation Threshold\t|75%|77.5%\n\nEthereum Aave v2 Parameter Changes Specification\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SNX Liquidation Threshold|62%|59%\n\nLowering SNX LT by 3% will liquidate 0xf81c8b55c2499af43ec387977c1d9cb1f1c78bca, who currently has HF 1.02 and supplies $50 SNX to borrow $30 USDT.\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use [Gauntlet’s Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile insolvency value that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile liquidation volume that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n**Disclaimer: Gauntlet reserves the right to not move forward with any parameter changes recommended in Snapshot polls, if market conditions change meaningfully.**\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust two (2) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Loan To Value, across one (1) Aave V2 asset. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of recommendations follows [AIP 117](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=117) to further de-risk the REN market. \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ aggregate positions & borrow usages**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ktXGW6P.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire supply**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zoCKkVn.png)\n\n**Top 30 borrowers’ entire borrows**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xO974Ct.png)\n\n**Price changes of key assets since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9D7yUOW.png)\n\n**Time series of Value at Risk (VaR) since 2022-11-03**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R8enrDr.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and percentage of total REN supplies:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m3qrkWx.png)\n\n**Top 10 REN suppliers and borrow usages:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CNBpVd8.png)\n\n**Entire supply positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rMEczds.png)\n\n**Entire borrow positions for top 10 REN suppliers:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HEKWdu8.png)\n\n\nBelow, Gauntlet analyzes the user which contributes the most Value at Risk per our simulations.\n\nUser: `0x364d5077c4c6bce6280705fe657fc4c55fdac363`\n\n**User supply breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QZW65gh.png)\n\n**Relevant collateral factors**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nOdid9p.png)\n\n**User borrowing power breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xsPK0i7.png)\n\n**User borrows breakdown**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1Tz7Anr.png)\n\n**User borrow usage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Tnwhl0a.png)\n\nNote that this user has been elastic as of late, updating their token positions often.\n\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\nThese parameter recommendations reflect the unique situation of REN in the current market conditions.  \n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **REN Liquidation Threshold**     | 65%     | ***60%***     |\n| **REN Loan To Value**     | 60%     | ***55%***     |\n\n\n\n## Notable Accounts to Flag\n\nAs of 11/16/2022, the data shows that only one dust account, `0x0e1337ea2c604f9a937d2623af206cdd02167b38` would be liquidated as a result of these parameter updates. This account has a total of ~$100 in supply.\n\nThis could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on this forum post.\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-11-21\n\n## Quick Links\n[Analytics Dashboard](https://metabase.gauntlet.network/public/dashboard/f4930651-29be-4ff3-b664-a34462e286c5)\n[Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave)\n[Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc)\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd) \n\nGauntlet launched an insolvency refund for Aave that contains a portion of our payment stream that can be clawed back in the event of insolvencies due to market risk.
