I am proposing for it to be enabled as collateral on AAVE V3 on Optimism with a 10 million sUSD supply cap.\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n- set sUSD max LTV to 60%\n- set liquidation threshold to 75%\n- set liquidation penalty to 5%\n- upgrade the interest rate curve to that of DAI/TUSD\n- Fixed lending is not enabled.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nsUSD market cap has grown tremendously over the past year, and the steady demand for decentralized stable coins has contributed to its growth. sUSD is highly over collateralized by SNX, the governance token, and backstop for the Synthetix protocol.\n\nThe rise in its liquidity on major dexes has contributed to sUSD stability over the past year, and allowing collateral use would promote its liquidity in aave markets.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nSNX stakers are incentivized to actively manage their debt relative to their SNX stake and sometimes cause spikes in demand for sUSD on markets including AAVE (especially when there are other Yield generating opportunities with sUSD), this may cause small deviations from the peg but with low volatility.\n\nFrom a counter-party risk perspective, all underlying functions in relation to sUSD are fundamentally the same as that of SNX.\n\nThe SNX and sUSD contracts are fully upgradeable. Still, all changes must go through a formal governance process from SIP to deployment, which would be announced well before the upgrades are made and thus does not present a substantial counter-party risk.\n\nThe sUSDv2CRV pool has deep liquidity on L1, and with incentivizes, the L2 pool will soon have deep liquidity. \n\nIn addition to sUSD, there are other synth pools on Curve with emission gauges to supplement sUSD liquidity (sBTC, sETH ). All synths are redeemable at their dollar value in sUSD at the ChainLink quoted price through the Synthetix protocol or Curve (via cross-asset swaps); thus they help facilitate the arbitrage sUSD peg deviations.\n\nreferences:\n\nsUSD/3crv curve pool - TVL $101M/27M sUSD\n\nsBTC curve pool- TVL $198M / $66M sBTC\n\nsETH curve pool- TVL $86M / $39M sETH\n\n**Technical Specifications sUSD**\n\nChainlink sUSD price feed: [Decentralized Price Reference Data | Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/docs/optimism-price-feeds/)\n\n\n",

        "body": "## Rationale:\nAdd GHST as collateral on Aave Polygon market.\n\n## Reference:\nARC Proposal: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-list-aavegotchi-ghst-token-as-collateral-on-matic-aave-network/3619/3\nThe DeFi Case for GHST Medium Post:  https://aavegotchi.medium.com/the-defi-case-for-ghst-256a8653346a\n\n## Overview:\nGHST is the eco-governance token of Aavegotchi, a fast-growing NFT game live on Polygon with NFTs backed by Aave aTokens, single-staking with 50-100% APY, multiple liquidity mining partnerships, and its own secondary market for NFT trading. \n\nGHST token has been live on Ethereum Mainnet since September 2020, when it was launched via a continuous bonding curve DAICO sale (still live today at aavegotchi.com/curve). \n\nThe token was launched at 0.2 DAI / GHST and currently sits at around 2.10 DAI. The all-time high is around 2 DAI / GHST. GHST is priced in DAI because unlike most tokens in crypto, it is actually backed by a DAI reserve at a 33% connecting weight. This makes the price more stable because it takes more in/out to change the price. \n\nGHST was bridged to Polygon in January 2021, with more than 50% of its current total supply locked into the Polygon Bridge. It is well-distributed, with more than 17,000 holders and stakers on Ethereum and Polygon combined, and is very active, with more than 1.2 million transactions and an average volume of $50M on multiple top-tier CEXes and DEXes. \n\n## Use Cases within the AAVE Ecosystem\nGHST has many use cases which make it an excellent choice for being listed as an Aave collateral:\n* Staking in Aavegotchi Staking contracts, earning FRENS\n* Providing liquidity on DEXes\n* Participating in #BidToEarn Auctions, where getting outbid earns you GHST\n* Staking as collateral within Aavegotchi NFTs\n* Purchasing and trading Aavegotchi NFT assets \n\nGHST’s relatively low normalized volatility also makes it an excellent choice for a collateral for borrowing. \n\n## Risk Analysis:\n**GHST Overall Risk is: B**\n\n### Smart Contract Risk: B-\nMaturity: 333 Days (Deployed on 9/14/2020)\nTransactions: 1,274,683\n\n### Counterparty Risk: B+\nHolders: 17,018 (Ethereum: 5854, Polygon: 8481, Stakers: 2683)\nPermission: Permissionless \n\n### Market Risk:  B\n\nMarket Cap: 130,000,000 \nAverage Volume:  $50,408,294\nNormalized Volatility: 6%\n\n**Overall Risk Score: B**\n\n## Proposed Risk Parameters\nUnlike most asset applications, we would like to propose two separate Risk Parameter options and allow the community to vote on their favorite. \n\nOption 1 is more conservative and in line with collaterals on the Aave Ethereum Market, while Option 2 is more liberal and similar to other collaterals on the Aave Polygon Market. \n\nFinally, we offer an option to only use GHST for borrowing, and an option to decline the listing completely. \n\n### Risk Parameters Option 1\nLTV:  25%\nLiquidation Threshold: 45%\nLiquidation Bonus: 12.5%*\nReserve Factor: 20%\n\n### Risk Parameters Option 2\nLTV:  50%\nLiquidation Threshold: 65%\nLiquidation Bonus: 12.5%*\nReserve Factor: 20%\n\n*In their recent report, Gauntlet suggested using max 12.5% LB\n\n## Snapshot Choices\n* Choice A -- Do not list \n* Choice B -- Only Borrowing Asset\n* Choice C -- Risk Param Choice 1\n* Choice D -- Risk Param Choice 2\n\n## Full Disclosure\nStani Kulechov is an official advisor of Aavegotchi, and Aave has invested into Pixelcraft Studios, the development team behind Aavegotchi.\n\n# Thank you for your consideration!\n❤️ Aavegotchi Fam\n\n",

Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\nFrax being a decentralized stablecoin is a good fit to be used as borrow assets as an alternative to currently existing stablecoins supported by the Aave Protocol.\nWith V3 emode, FRAX is a great fit to join a stablecoin emode that will both have potential to increase Aave & FRAX volume while contributing to the stability of the FRAX asset. Additionally, FRAX can use its Lending AMO (similar to Maker’s DAI Direct Deposit Module) to mint protocol controlled FRAX to be lent out on Aave markets. FRAX already does this with an Aave Lending AMO on ETH mainnet to great success. We can commit to deploying similar Aave Lending AMOs to Aave v3 after FRAX is listed.\n\n4. How is the asset currently used?\nFRAX is a decentralized stablecoin minted in a permisionless way by users of the frax.finance protocol, FRAX is currently being LP’d in deep liquidity pools on stableswap+AMM protocols such as Uniswap V3, Solidly, Curve (4Pool), and others.\n5. Emission schedule\nFRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.\n6. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig?\nThere is a multisig which can operate certain AMO contracts but cannot in any way change users’ FRAX balances, cannot freeze or pause any user’s funds, and cannot in any way alter the behavior of the protocol or sweep/rug collateral or value. There are no FRAX whitelists/blacklists in any capacity as it is entirely a bearer asset/decentralized exactly like DAI.\n\n7. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\nMarket Cap: ~$2.7B\n24h Volume: ~$50M\nVolatility: stablecoin (extremely low)\nExchanges: Curve, SushiSwap, Uniswap v3, Fraxswap, QuickSwap, Saddle, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, Solarbeam, TraderJoe, and Rose\nMaturity: Launched 12/20/20\nFRAX token (global view)\n\nDate of deployment: Dec 20th, 2020\nNumber of crosschain token holders: 25,000+\n#### Security Considerations\nFrax has undergone 2 thorough audits, the most recent of which being an entire audit by Trail of Bits published here: publications/FraxFinance.pdf at master · trailofbits/publications · GitHub 1\n\nThe protocol currently holds over $3.5 billion in TVL across all chains",

        "body": "Author: Alchemix Core Team\nForum Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-alusd-as-borrowable-to-aave-v2/7191\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list alUSD as a borrowable asset on Aave. alUSD has established itself as one of the leading new stablecoins in terms of stability and liquidity, and listing on Aave will provide users with a proven stablecoin to borrow. Alchemix has 376m TVL in the form of yvDAI and DAI backing alUSD, with a liquid supply of 239m alUSD. alUSD has one of the deepest Curve pools, with ~450m in liquidity. In addition to the Curve pool, alUSD has additional liquidity on Sushiswap, Saddle, and mStable. According to Parsec Finance’s StableRank, alUSD is routinely among the top stablecoins in terms of price stability and liquidity within 1% slippage. Having been on the market for over 6 months while maintaining the peg through turbulent market conditions, alUSD has built the reputation required to be an asset listed on AAVE.\n\n[alUSD StableRank Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/iMyToUj)\n\n# About Alchemix and alUSD\nAlchemix is an evolution of the tried and true CDP model trailblazed by MakerDAO. Alchemix is, at its core, an overcollateralized stablecoin, much like DAI and other similar tokens. It has some key differences however.\n\nAlchemix only mints like-kind or “mirror” al-Assets. For example, alUSD is only mintable by DAI (and later USDT and USDC), and alETH is only mintable by ETH (and later other ETH derivatives). Deposited collateral is then deployed to yearn, of which the earned yield doubly repays users’ debt and backs the dollar peg in the Transmuter module. In addition, there is no interest paid in the borrowing of al-Assets. Due to this structure, Alchemix does not have liquidations in its system. This allows people to maximum borrow without fear of shifting market conditions - taking an essentially risk free negative interest alUSD loan with their DAI. In effect, the system acts as a way to get an advance on your yield for your stablecoin deposits.\n\nAlchemix ensures the alUSD peg with the following mechanisms.\n1. 50% LTV for minting alUSD, which prevents excessive recursive leverage in the protocol.\n2. DAO-managed debt caps that limit the over-minting of alUSD\n3. The ability to repay debt in alUSD or DAI. If alUSD is under the peg, people can buy it off the market and repay their loan at a discount. If alUSD is over the peg, users can sell alUSD to DAI and repay with DAI to arbitrage the price, and they can self-liquidate their collateral to mint more alUSD to trade to DAI for arbitrage.\n4. The Transmuter module guarantees 1:1 conversions of alUSD to DAI, the conversion process isn’t instant, but it can present good arbitrage opportunities, which helps to stabilize the peg.\n5. Alchemix rewards ALCX governance tokens for alUSD liquidity providers, which attracts liquidity to the pool, further boosting the peg.\n\nalUSD minted from a new loan has a collateralization ratio of 200%, while alUSD minted from repaid debt has a collateralization ratio of 100%. The total global collateralization ratio for alUSD is 157%. The supply can expand in two ways – an expansion in the debt ceiling followed by users taking new loans, or debt repayments with DAI, which decrement the global debt while not destroying alUSD. This is how we have a supply of ~239m with a current debt cap of 150m. alUSD can be burned by staking it in the transmuter, where it is converted 1:1 to DAI over time.\n\nThese mechanisms in tandem have allowed for alUSD to remain extremely close to the $1 peg since its inception.\n\n# Motivation\nalUSD has established itself as a reliable and liquid stablecoin. In addition to protocol improvements, Alchemix DAO believes that integrating alUSD throughout DeFi will help us in that goal. Because AAVE is the leading lending protocol across all of crypto, getting on AAVE as a borrowable asset would lend a lot of legitimacy to alUSD. The more tightly integrated alUSD is within DeFi, the more resilient it will become, which will allow alUSD to safely grow in supply.\n\nGoing forward, Alchemix will expand beyond our current set up of using DAI in the yvDAI yearn vault as collateral, and expand the selection of stablecoin collaterals and yield earning strategies. AAVE is one such source of yield that we are looking to plug into in the future. When these upgrades take place, we predict that Alchemix will be one of the larger liquidity providers to AAVE, similar to how Alchemix is currently one of the largest liquidity providers on Yearn.\n\n# alUSD Benefits to Aave Users\nalUSD is desirable to borrow because it is tightly pegged to DAI, USDC, USDT, mUSD, FEI, FRAX, and LUSD in our various markets. It is simple to swap between other stables. DEX aggregators make it simple to trade between alUSD and any other asset on Ethereum too. In addition, there are attractive farming incentives for alUSD LPs. For people that are looking to borrow alUSD but don’t have stablecoins from which to mint it, borrowing alUSD on AAVE will provide more options to get alUSD. The alUSD can be used for yield farming, or through highly liquid swaps into other stable coins, to finance their personal life or to speculate on the market. alUSD is also used in an alETH/alUSD options market on premia.finance. Alchemix plans to continue to expand alUSD use cases in the future through partnerships and integrations.\n\n# Security Considerations and Risk Analysis\nCertik Audit for the Core Contracts: https://alchemix.fi/a208baf6ca7e0d6b0116461f05e27cd9.pdf\n\nCurrently, the Alchemix protocol can be paused or modified by a multisig. The protocol controls the alUSD debt cap and collateralization ratio through DAO voting, which is then executed by a community + developer multisig + timelock contract. The DAO prioritizes peg stability above all else when considering parameter changes.\n\nAave has already conducted risk analysis on DAI, the current sole backing stablecoin of alUSD, and assigned an overall risk rating of B+ [Risks per Asset - Risk](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risks-per-asset). USDC and USDT strategies will be added as alUSD collateral later. USDC and USDT have ratings of A- and B+ respectively. The new risks from introducing alUSD are Alchemix/alUSD and Yearn Vault contract risks. Risk to Aave is minimized due to alUSD being enabled for borrowing but not as collateral.\n\nThe Alchemix DAO multisig and timelock wallet is the administrator for the alUSD token. It has the ability to grant and revoke other contracts the minter role. Currently, all alUSD minting is handled by the alchemist.sol contract. When we launch our version two, the new contracts will also be granted the minting permissions. Alchemix employs a modular approach where the Transmuter and Vault Adapter modules can be swapped out and replaced with upgraded versions. The core alchemist.sol contract cannot be upgraded, but the multisig and timelock wallet can change the following parameters: collateralization ratio, debt ceiling, and fee percentage. Each member of the core Alchemix development team has permission to enable Alchemix’s sentinel mode, which pauses the contract in case of an emergency.\n\n# Protocol Data\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap - 242,165,957 USD.\n- 24h Volume - typically ranges between 1-4m.\n- Markets: Curve, Saddle, Sushi, mStable, Premia\n\n### Social Channels data (Size of communities, activity on github)\n- Twitter: 40.2k\n- Discord: 7.5k\n- Medium: 1.7k\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens:\n- alUSD Deployment Date: 2/27/2021\n- Transactions: 49,594\n- Token Holders: 1328\n\n# Implementation\nThe alUSD price oracle will be served via Chainlink.
