        "body": "## [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave on Rootstock Network\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2025-01-07\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check advocates the deployment of Aave on the Rootstock network, the longest-standing and battle-tested EVM-compatible Bitcoin L2, by providing general background information to gauge the community's interest in the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Rootstock.\n\nThis deployment proposal is an opportunity to tap into the growing interest in Bitcoin-based DeFi and unlock the vast potential of the Bitcoin market cap by expanding BTC utility via Aave's protocol. This would be possible through Rootstock's native token, RBTC, which is a 1:1 BTC-pegged asset redeemable for BTC via a secure and trust-minimized two-way-peg. As a Proof-of-Work chain [secured by more than 60% of Bitcoin's hash power](https://stats.rootstock.io/) through a merged-mining mechanism, Rootstock ensures a safe network for those users who aim to leverage their BTC but do not want to lack Bitcoin security.\n\nThe proposal outlines a comprehensive liquidity bootstrapping and incentives distribution strategy to ensure the success of deploying Aave on Rootstock. This includes an initial liquidity injection commitment of 500 RBTC in collaboration with RootstockLabs and ecosystem partners and a $750,000 incentives program. Rootstrock is also willing to integrate the GHO stablecoin in its ecosystem providing rate predictability for users.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRootstock, the first and most secured Bitcoin Layer, aims to enhance Bitcoin's functionality by allowing smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. It is the first EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain and uses merged mining consensus for enhanced security and scalability. Rootstock has secured over 60% of the total Bitcoin hashrate, meaning that more than 60% of Bitcoin miners are securing the Rootstock network using the same hardware and energy input.\n\nThe permissionless network has experienced significant growth in 2024 in all major metrics. This can be attributed partially to Rootstock's onboarding and partnership with major protocols such as Sushi and Uniswap. Liquidity's strong proliferation demonstrates the growing demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi applications.\n\nRootstock employs a unique bridging system called Powpeg to enable the secure transfer of BTC into the Rootstock network as RBTC, and vice versa. This system is managed by specialized nodes known as Powpeg functionaries, which include entities like BlockVenture, Luxor, pNetwork, Collider, RootstockLabs, and Xapo.  Rootstock's [public roadmap](https://rootstock.io/roadmap/) includes several technical upgrades to improve speed, security, and functionality. This innovative roadmap led by Sergio Lerner, RootstockLabs’ Chief Scientist and Co-Founder, also selected as one of 50 people influential in Crypto in 2024 by [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2024/12/05/most-influential-2024), has been implementing several upgrades such as the development of [BitVMX](https://bitvmx.org/), a trust-minimized bridge between the Bitcoin mainchain and Rootstock sidechain.\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Rootstock offers a strategic advantage by capitalizing on the growing demand for DeFi applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The increasing usage of wrapped Bitcoin on EVM chains serves as a proxy for this latent demand, indicating a desire to utilize Bitcoin-based collateral in DeFi protocols. Rootstock addresses this demand by providing a more decentralized and self-custodial alternative through its native token RBTC, and its underlying infrastructure.\n\n### **Reasons for Integration:**\n\n- **Access the Bitcoin-based DeFi through a battle-tested Bitcoin L2:** It has a large ecosystem with 170+ dApps and protocols deployed and a growing TVL. With the growing demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi, Rootstock is well-positioned to capitalize on this market as it is the network with real utility and use cases. Its canonical deployment on Uniswap V3, which got over 40 million votes, demonstrated the rising demand and interest in Rootstock. The combination of Rootstock’s features with a widely used protocol is the key to a win-win integration. Strategic integrations with Top tier dApps like Uniswap v3 on Oku, Sushi, Algebra DEXs, Solv Finance, Money on Chain, Symbiosis, Pell Network make Rootstock leading the DeFi ecosystem in the Bitcoin L2 space.\n- **Advanced Infrastructure :** Rootstock is the most advanced and complete infrastructure ecosystem in the Bitcoin Layer 2 space with Oracles, Indexers, and Developers tools, including Chainlink (Price feeds and CCIP integration by January/February), Redstone Finance, Alchemy, Gelato, The Graph, Goldsky, Bware Labs.\n- **RBTC, as a Bitcoin-asset collateral:** Rootstock uses RBTC (bridged version of Bitcoin) for transaction fees, avoiding the need for a separate native token. The Powpeg system handles the transfer of value between Bitcoin and Rootstock, minting and burning RBTC as required. This makes it an ideal collateral for DeFi lending and borrowing. By deploying Aave on Rootstock, Aave can enable users to use RBTC as collateral for loans, which will address demand and diversify options for Bitcoin-backed assets. Rootstock has this ambitious plan to expand RBTC to other chains. RBTC enables the most decentralized, secure, seamless, omnichain access to Bitcoin for DeFi use cases, allowing users to retain Bitcoin's core properties.\n- **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Rootstock has been investing in core-infrastructure partnerships, which facilitate the flow of assets between several networks. In the past months, it has announced several Top-tier partnerships like LayerZero, Stargate, LiFi, Jumper Exchange, Symbiosis, ChainPort, Rubic. No other BTC L2 can offer Rootstock trajectory and assets deployed by Stargate.\n- **GHO Integrated with the Ecosystem:** Rootstock will integrate and support the GHO stablecoin as a key USD stablecoin. By integrating GHO, Rootstock will unlock new opportunities for users to leverage the value of their Bitcoin holdings with rate predictability for users. RootstockLabs plans to bootstrap GHO liquidity in Rootstock's DEXs like Uniswap and Sushi, and also foster users' adoption by distributing incentives in GHO pools.\n- **Access to Institutions liquidity: RootstockLabs is already actively collaborating with institutional partners to attract and secure institutional capital across the network. Those institutions already showed their interest to use Aave for lending against Bitcoin and this deployment will be strategic to address capital allocation from institutional partners like Crypto banks, Hedge Funds, Liquid Funds and miners.**\n\nThis active collaboration with institutional investors aims to attract extra deposit commitments to ensure liquidity diversification and high adoption of Aave in Rootstock. Rootstock is able to address institutional demand in the Bitcoin Layer space because it is integrated with Fireblocks and Utila, which ensures access to Rootstock and its ecosystem. In 2025, RootstockLabs team is working to expand institutional-grade partnerships to be consolidated also as the most advanced infrastructure for institutional investors.\n\n## **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nRecognizing the monumental opportunity to unlock and capture an emerging market in the Bitcoin-based DeFi ecosystem, this proposal outlines a robust liquidity and incentive strategy designed to attract and retain users on Rootstock.\n\n- **Proof of Liquidity: To ensure a strong start for Aave on Rootstock, RootstockLabs, the core contributor to Rootstock, along with ecosystem and institutional partners, will commit a substantial amount of liquidity to Aave's pools.**\n    - **Liquidity Bootstrapping of 500 BTC (approximately $50 million USD).**\n- **Incentives Distribution: RootstockLabs has partnered with IntoTheBlock to design and develop a liquidity bootstrap plan across the network through incentives distribution, this plan includes Aave. By deploying on Rootstock, we will distribute $750,000.00 in incentives for fostering Aave's adoption across Rootstock network.**\n    - **LM Goal:** this program will incentivize liquidity providers in the Bitcoin landscape to actively participate in the Aave's markets on Rootstock, ensuring diversified liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n## **Technical Feasibility**\n\n1. **Seamless Integration and Compatibility with v3:**\n    - Rootstock is an [EVM-compatible chain](https://dev.rootstock.io/concepts/fundamentals/stack/), which means Ethereum smart contracts are fully compatible.\n2. **Chainlink Integration:**\n    - RootstockLabs team has received a commitment from Chainlink to get its deployment live by January/February.\n3. **The Graph Integration:**\n    - Rootstock has deployed The Graph functionality on Mainnet, which will be available for Aave's integration.\n4. **Development and Testing**\n    - RootstockLabs will assist Aave's technical team and BDG Labs through its Integration and Support team to ensure a smooth integration.\n5. **Security Audits:**\n    - The RootstockLabs team, in collaboration with Aave's security team, will run audits to ensure that the deployment meets all security requirements.\n\n## **Deployment Plan**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Initial Discussion**\n    - Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n2. **Phase 2: Detailed Proposal**\n    - If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n3. **Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring**\n    - Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on Rootstock and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n## **Risks and Mitigations:**\n\n1. **Technical Challenges:**\n    - RootstockLabs will work closely with Aave's developers and service providers to address any technical challenges during integration.\n2. **Security Risks:**\n    - A robust security audit will be conducted by Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk in order to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with this proposal and deployment. RootstockLabs will be available to address raised concerns, and support this audit.\n3. **Community Adoption:**\n    - RootstockLabs will activate its community to engage with the Aave community ensuring support and adoption. Also it will work aligned with the Aave community to engage and attract users to Rootstock.\n\n## **Call to Action:**\n\nWe invite the Aave community to express their support or concerns regarding this TEMP CHECK. Your feedback is crucial in determining whether to proceed with a detailed ARFC for the Aave V3 deployment on Rootstock, and will help us ensure that the integration aligns with Aave’s goals and community interests.\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nRootstock Concepts: https://dev.rootstock.io/concepts/\n\nUnderstanding Rootstock by Messari: https://messari.io/report/understanding-rootstock\n\nState of Rootstock Q3 2024: https://messari.io/report/state-of-rootstock-q3-2024\n\nRootstockLabs: https://www.rootstocklabs.com/\n\nAave Documentation: https://aave.com/docs\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on the Spiderchain (Botanix Labs)",
        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "## Author: @ACI\n## Date: 2024-11-13\n\n---\n\n**Proposal Overview:**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK seeks to gauge the Aave community’s interest in deploying Aave V3 on the Spiderchain, the leading Bitcoin EVM L2 developed by Botanix Labs. \n\nBotanix Labs proposes this integration to expand Aave within the emerging Bitcoin DeFi narrative, with the first Bitcoin L2 with a full DeFi ecosystem and the largest community of users - including a new market of Bitcoiners transacting on chain for the first time. Upon mainnet launch, Botanix will also present to the market its synthetic 1:1 representation of Bitcoin on the L2, which will be the most decentralized form of “wrapped” Bitcoin in the EVM ecosystem. \n\nThis can help diversify the type of Bitcoin assets on Aave, especially considering its acceptance by the Bitcoin community. Botanix also intends to incorporate the GHO stablecoin throughout the ecosystem to further strategically align with Aave, providing incremental revenue upside for Aave DAO.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe Spiderchain is the first fully decentralized EVM-equivalent Layer 2 on Bitcoin, where the ease and versatility of EVM meets the decentralization and security of Bitcoin. Leveraging Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) as a Layer 1 for base settlement and decentralization, Botanix Labs will use a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model, where the stakes (represented by bitcoin) are securely stored on the Spiderchain, a distributed network of decentralized multisigs safeguarded by a randomized subset of participants. Botanix runs on Bitcoin, with BTC as the gas token and settlement layer, and yield accrued back to stakers in native BTC. The Spiderchain is the most performant Bitcoin L2 EVM with average block times of ~5 seconds and gas fees of $0.01 per transaction. As noted above, Botanix’ form of “wrapped” Bitcoin will be the most decentralized form of Bitcoin in the L2 EVM ecosystem - with decentralized sequencers available on Day 1. As such, Aave’s counterparty risk with BTC derivatives will be significantly reduced and offer greater asset diversification, especially as the Spiderchain enjoys widespread acceptance within the technical community.\n\nThe Botanix Labs team preempted the Bitcoin Season II narrative and has been building for almost two years. As such, they have already built out the major DeFi primitives required for an end-to-end DeFi experience with ~20 native ecosystem teams and another ~40 dApps (including Tier 1 DeFi protocols such as Vertex, Frax, Kiln, etc.) deploying Day 1 of mainnet. The non-incentivized testnet v0 launched in November 2023 and garnered 1.5M transactions, 500K users/wallets connected, 30K contracts launched community. Botanix Labs also has ~60K highly engaged community members, making it the largest organic community in Bitcoin. Despite not having a chain-level points program, the team has secured significant Day 1 liquidity commitments.\n\nBy deploying Aave V3 on the Spiderchain, they aim to enhance liquidity options and provide users with more opportunities within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Reasons for Integration:**\n\n1. **Early Mover Advantage within Bitcoin DeFi as a Launch Partner**\n    - With a deployment on the Spiderchain, and considering Aave’s brand as the incumbent leader in DeFi, Aave has the potential to capture significant early mover advantage on the only Bitcoin chain with a high-quality DeFi ecosystem as the flagship lending protocol. As the most decentralized Bitcoin-aligned chain, Botanix Labs has also secured net new TVL commitments from BTC whales who have previously never engaged with DeFi.\n2. **Access and Penetration to Bitcoiner userbase**\n    - The Spiderchain plans to be the home of Bitcoin-native DeFi, whereby once a user onboards their Bitcoin to the Botanix EVM, they can have an end-to-end DeFi experience (DEX, stablecoins, lending/borrowing, derivatives, staking, etc.) and experience native bitcoin yield without necessarily bridging to other chains. As such, it attracts a new Bitcoiner profile that is excited about DeFi and the potential of earning yield. With an integration, Aave can attract this new set of on-chain users.\n3. **Integration with GHO within the Spiderchain ecosystem**\n    - Botanix Labs will integrate and support the GHO stablecoin across the ecosystem, as one of the key USD stablecoins that will enable users to borrow against their BTC collateral.\n    - The core product of the GHO stablecoin, backed by BTC, is one of the most anticipated use cases for Bitcoiners and the Botanix team expects rapid adoption of this primitive. Assuming a linear increase in GHO borrowing caps, the team expects a high capture rate of new borrows with Aave DAO being the primary beneficiary in this interest income upside.\n4. **Innovation within Bitcoin Scaling**\n    - The Spiderchain is well accepted as a meaningful technical innovation within the Bitcoin community, with its innovation of decentralized multisigs supported by PoS being recognized as one of the few L2 scaling designs that is possible today on Bitcoin core without any soft forks needed.\n5. **Most Performant Bitcoin L2**\n    - The Spiderchain offers high throughput and low latency, with 5 second block times, which can support Aave’s transaction demands and maintain user experience.\n    - Lower transaction fees on the Spiderchain can reduce operational costs for Aave users and make DeFi activities more affordable.\n6. **Strategic Partnership with Chainlink**\n    - Chainlink Labs is a strategic partner of Botanix Labs, as a key infrastructure and market partner. Botanix Labs will integrate with ChainLink’s Price Feeds as the oracle provider for the market, and with the recently announced Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enhance the functionality and security of Aave on the Spiderchain.\n7. **Liquidity Provision**\n    - As Botanix Labs is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem, they have been able to secure significant liquidity commitments and can bootstrap initial liquidity for Aave to run smoothly upon deployment. Exact LP details can be determined in the next phase of the deployment process, but we can conservatively expect at least $20M in BTC commitments to Aave upon mainnet launch.\n\n**Technical Feasibility:**\n\n1. **Seamless Integration and Compatibility with v4:**\n    - The Spiderchain is EVM-equivalent, running the rust implementation of the EVM (reth), ensuring an easy integration with Aave V3’s existing codebase.\n2. **Chainlink Integration:**\n    - ChainLink’s Price Feeds will be available Day 1 of mainnet, along with CCIP as the canonical bridging partner.\n3. **The Graph Integration:**\n    - Botanix Labs will have The Graph’s subgraph functionality enabled Day 1 of mainnet, ensuring an easy migration for Aave.\n4. **Development and Testing:**\n    - Botanix Labs will coordinate with Aave’s technical team including BGD to ensure a seamless deployment, including comprehensive testing on Botanix’s testnet.\n5. **Security Audits:**\n    - Botanix Labs will work with Aave’s security team to perform thorough audits and ensure that the deployment meets all security standards.\n\n**Deployment Plan:**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Initial Discussion**\n    - Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n2. **Phase 2: Detailed Proposal**\n    - If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n3. **Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring**\n    - Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on the Spiderchain and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n**Risks and Mitigations:**\n\n1. **Technical Challenges:**\n    - Botanix Labs will work closely with Aave’s developers and service providers (such as BGD and ACI) to address any technical challenges during integration.\n2. **Security Risks:**\n    - A comprehensive security audit will be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This would be in addition to the proposal’s review by Aave’s risk managers, Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk.\n3. **Community Adoption:**\n    - They will engage with the Aave community throughout the process to ensure alignment and support.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nWe invite the Aave community to express their support or concerns regarding this TEMP CHECK. Your feedback is crucial in determining whether to proceed with a detailed ARFC for the Aave V3 deployment on the Spiderchain, and will help us ensure that the integration aligns with Aave’s goals and community interests.\n\n**Links and References:**\n\n- The Spiderchain Overview: https://docs.botanixlabs.xyz/botanix-labs/\n- Aave V3 Technical Documentation: https://docs.aave.com/developers\n- Botanix Labs: https://botanixlabs.xyz/\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "## [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on BOB\n\n## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-12-18\n\n**Simple Summary**:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of an Aave V3 pool on BOB, a hybrid L2 that strives to combine the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBOB (\"Build on Bitcoin\") is a Hybrid Layer-2 blockchain that combines the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum to create the home for Bitcoin DeFi. The unique Hybrid L2 model merges the strengths of both ecosystems—Bitcoin's security and dormant capital, with Ethereum's DeFi innovation and versatility. As a [Hybrid L2](https://docs.gobob.xyz/whitepaper.pdf) BOB will inherit security from Bitcoin, as the most secure and decentralized network. Bitcoin security is then used to create trust-minimized bridges to Bitcoin (via BitVM2), Ethereum, and eventually other L1s. As a result, the Hybrid L2 does not need to rely on third-party bridges for interoperability, concentrating liquidity around Bitcoin instead of fragmenting it across chains.\n\nBOB’s mainnet Phase 1 has been live since May 2024, bootstrapped as an ETH L2 and member of the OP Superchain with an ecosystem of 100+ projects live or building (incl. Uniswap, Solv, Sovryn etc.). BOB has successfully captured the growing interest in Bitcoin staking and yield-bearing assets, achieving [∽$250m in DeFi TVL](https://defillama.com/chain/BOB) and [320k unique users](https://explorer.gobob.xyz/stats) since launch and growing. BOB supports decentralized tBTC as well as institutional wBTC, FBTC and SolvBTC as BTC bridges (more soon), as well as numerous Bitcoin LSTs including SolvBTC.BBN, Lombard LBTC, UniBTC and PumpBTC (more soon). The novel [BOB Stake](https://app.gobob.xyz/stake) product allows holders to deploy BTC into any BTC DeFi position with just 1 Bitcoin transaction (via intents) and has been used by 28k users.\n\nBOB is an active contributor to BitVM (co-founder Alexei is one of the co-authors of the [BitVM2 and BitVM Bridge technical paper](https://bitvm.org/bitvm_bridge.pdf), the design currently being implemented on the [official open-source repository](https://github.com/BitVM/BitVM)). As of today, BitVM is the only known solution that can achieve trust-minimized and arguably “non-custodial” Bitcoin bridging and unlock billions of USD in dormant BTC liquidity. BOB mainnet Phase 2 which introduces Bitcoin finality and the trust-minimized BitVM bridge will be rolling out in Q1 2025.\n\n**Reasons for deployment**\n\n1. **First mover in Bitcoin DeFi and BTC LSTs**\n    1. With a deployment on BOB, Aave can solidify its position as the leading marketplace for BTC loans, and capture the growing BTC LST market. Already [$6bn](https://btcstaking.babylonlabs.io/) of BTC have been staked within months of Babylon launch. Drawing parallels to the success of ETH LSTs (46bn), we anticipate a 200bn+ BTC staking market in the next 3-5 years given Bitcoin's market size.\n    2. Currently [$4bn](https://app.aave.com/markets/?marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) of wBTC are deployed into Aave without generating any interest. By allowing users to build up leveraged BTC LST positions, we confidently estimate Aave can generate 3-5% APY for wBTC holders. This could result in up to $250m in monthly borrowing fees, not accounting for additional liquidation and flash loan fees.\n    3. BOB and Babylon are strategic partners: as a Bitcoin-Secured Network, BOB’s network fees contribute to the rewards of BTC stakers. This creates a positive reinforcement loop: the more BTC LST liquidity on BOB, the more DeFi activity, the more fees accrue to BTC stakers. This encourages more BTC to be staked, which brings more DeFi activity, and the flywheel continues.\n    4. All major Bitcoin LSTs are already supported on BOB: SolvBTC, Lombard LBTC, UniBTC, PumpBTC with 200m+ deployed, and more integrations on the way. This makes BOB the best place for BTC LST DeFi.\n2. **Trust-minimized BTC bridges**\n    1. BOB is developing a trustless BitVM-based BTC bridge, gradually rolling out from Q1 2025 onward.\n    2. BOB has been actively working with tBTC since May 2024, becoming one of the largest L2s in tBTC on-chain DeFi liquidity (2nd only to Base).\n    3. This way BOB covers the 2 possible approaches to trust-minimized BTC bridging:\n        1. Best today: TSS/decentralized multisig via tBTC (n-of-m honest majority). Battletested 2+ years with 500m in TVL.\n        2. Best in the future: Fraud-proof based via BitVM (1-of-n, existential honesty like native ETH L2 bridges)\n3. **Aave as backend for 5m+ retail BTC users w. 1-click deposits**\n    1. BOB allows users to deposit BTC into Aave and borrow against with just 1 BTC transaction, solving Bitcoin's long-standing DeFi UX problem. The underlying technology is the first-ever instance of [Bitcoin intents](https://blog.gobob.xyz/posts/bob-gateway-connecting-bitcoin-through-intents).\n    2. [BOB Stake](https://blog.gobob.xyz/posts/stake-btc-in-a-single-click-with-bob-stake), a 1-click BTC staking SDK built with Bitcoin intents, has been used by 28k users and is currently being integrated by StakingRewards.com, Xverse wallet, Everstake, Pell and others - soon offering 1-click DeFi access to 5m+ BTC users.\n    3. BOB will integrate Aave such that BTC holders can supply BTC, borrow against BTC or run strategies with just 1 BTC transaction from all major BTC wallets. This will help position Aave as the go-to lending market for the Bitcoin community.\n4. **Access to Institutional BTC liquidity**\n    1. While trust-minimized BTC bridges are the future of Bitcoin DeFi, their adoption will likely take at least another 2-3 years given the technical risks associated with new bridge technologies (feedback collected from over 50+ BTC whales and institutional LPs). BitVM is the perceived future and there is a lot of interest in its success. However, until BitVM is live on mainnet and sufficiently battle-tested, the majority of BTC liquidity prefers to use institutional custody solutions.\n    2. BOB already supports native minting of FBTC, SolvBTC, and BTC LSTs such as SolvBTC.BBN, Lombard LBTC, uniBTC and PumpBTC. wBTC is supported via ETH, with native minting expected in Q1 via LayerZero\n    3. Together with existing (Cobo) and upcoming (e.g. Fireblocks, …) institutional custody integrations, BOB is best positioned to capture the growing institutional interest in BTC DeFi.\n5. **Best-in-class liquidity onramps**\n    1. Trustless access to ETH and ERC20s via native L2 bridge (OP stack)\n    2. Native support for USDT and USDC.e via Ethereum\n    3. CCIP support for fast on/off-ramps\n    4. Direct deposits from CEXes going live Q4 2024\n6. **Support and growth of GHO in BOB's DeFi ecosystem**\n    1. BOB is keen to support and grow GHO liquidity as parts of its DeFi liquidity campaigns. This will serve to position GHO as one of the main decentralized stablecoins borrowed / minted against BTC - taking advantage of Bitcoin's validated PMF as the best collateral asset in DeFi.\n7. **Liquidity Provision**\n    1. BOB boasts a growing DeFi ecosystem: $350m on-chain deposits ([source: Dune](https://dune.com/daedalus_angels/build-on-bitcoin-bob-overview)) of which $250m are deployed in DeFi across Tier-1 protocols ([source: DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/BOB)). Notably, BOB has grown to the #5 Uniswap v3 market in just 2 months ([source: DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/protocol/uniswap-v3))\n    2. BOB has a conservative estimate of $200m+ in liquidity commitments for Aave across wrapped BTC and BTC LST assets.\n    3. BOB is a OP Superchain member and received a 750k OP grant to boost user activity and DeFi\n    4. BOB is ready to support the Aave deployment via a liquidity program to ensure successful bootstrapping targeting $125m in TVL of wrapped BTC assets, resulting in a total market size of $250m taking into account e-mode and BTC LST markets. BOB has also received commitments from selected LST projects to launch or extend already running liquidity programs to assist with bootstrapping.\n    5. Exact liquidity program details can be determined in the next phase of the deployment process.\n\n**Technical Feasibility**\n\n1. **Integration. BOB is an OP stack chain with 2 second block times and cents for fees. The chain is operated in collaboration with Conduit.In terms of developer tooling and available infrastructure, BOB matches the best in class standards of Optimism and Base. BOB currently uses ETH as fee asset during bootstrapping for compatibility, with BTC support being added via account abstraction and eventually as native fee asset as well. Since Aave is already deployed on Optimism and Base, the deployment to BOB is expected to be straightforward.**\n2. **Price feeds. Chainlink is a strategic partner of BOB and CCIP is going live in December 2024. BOB will ensure ChainLink price feeds are available at the time of Aave deployment.**\n3. **Technical support. BOB Foundation will provide all technical resources needed to support Aave's technical team during deployment and maintenance.**\n\n**Deployment Plan**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Initial Discussion**\n    - Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n2. **Phase 2: Detailed Proposal**\n    - If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n3. **Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring**\n    - Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on BOB and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n**Risks and Mitigations**\n\n1. **Technical Challenges:**\n    - BOB will work closely with Aave’s developers and service providers (such as BGD and ACI) to address any technical challenges during integration.\n2. **Security Risks:**\n    - BOB is an OP Stack chain and Superchain member. The L2 is operated in collaboration with Conduit. BOB will continue working closely with OP Labs and Conduit to ensure secure operation of the OP stack L2. All privileged roles are tracked transparently [here](https://docs.gobob.xyz/learn/reference/privileged-roles).\n    - In addition, BOB is currently onboarding real-time threat detection partners (provider selection ongoing).\n    - BOB follows security best practices, auditing every product launch and future chain-level upgrades ([audit reports](https://docs.gobob.xyz/learn/reference/audits/)), while also operating a [bug bounty program](https://r.xyz/bug-bounty/programs/bob).\n    - This is in addition to the proposal’s review by Aave’s risk managers, Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk.\n3. **Community Adoption:**\n    - BOB will engage with the Aave community throughout the process to ensure alignment and support. BOB's community of Bitcoin builders and enthusiasts counts over 300k members across various channels.\n\n### Links and References:\n\n- BOB\n    - Overview: https://gobob.xyz/summary\n    - Website: https://www.gobob.xyz/\n    - Hybrid L2 Whitepaper: https://docs.gobob.xyz/whitepaper.pdf\n    - Docs: https://docs.gobob.xyz/\n- Aave V3 Technical Documentation: [Aave Protocol Overview](https://docs.aave.com/developers)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not directly affiliated with BOB Foundation and did not receive compensation related to this proposal.

However, it also brings limitations, especially considering the existence of many non-EVM blockchains that offer different advantages such as lower transaction fees, higher throughput, and more advanced consensus mechanisms. In addition to purely technical advantages, many non-EVM blockchains can allow the Aave community to expand to an entirely new ecosystem, previously inaccessible user groups, and introduce new product possibilities.\n\nAptos is a blockchain designed for building scalable and secure dApps. Developed by former leaders of Meta's Diem blockchain project, it aims to address some of the limitations in existing blockchain systems such as throughput, scalability, and security. With a TVL of approximately $350m and growing rapidly, Aptos is the 17th largest chain by TVL (source: [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Aptos)). Its robust infrastructure offers high transaction throughput, low, predictable fees, and advanced security through the [Move programming language](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/why-move), that make Aptos an ideal platform for DeFi applications. The chain has a diverse array of [DeFi](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/defi) offerings, including prominent projects like Thala, Aries Markets, Amnis Finance, Econia, alongside primarily EVM-native projects such as Sushiswap and Pancake Swap. Aptos Labs Founders Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching have leveraged their extensive experience at Meta to propel Aptos towards becoming a leader in scalable and secure blockchain solutions. Moreover, Aptos has established high-profile partnerships with industry giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft, SK Telecom and many more others, further enhancing its technological capabilities and broadening its influence.\n\n*Advantages of Aptos*\n\nAptos offers several significant advantages that make it an ideal platform for high-demand applications. With its ability to handle over [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), it excels in supporting DeFi, real-time financial services, gaming, AI and other use cases. The platform's agile governance allows for rapid upgrades and swift implementation of new features. Additionally, Aptos ensures low and predictable fees through a stable fee model, and its use of the Move programming language enhances security with formal verification and resource-oriented programming. Built-in security features and automated auditing tools streamline the security process, while advanced state management techniques optimize data storage and access. Furthermore, Aptos simplifies integration with other blockchains through built-in interoperability, creating a cohesive and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos represents a groundbreaking expansion as it marks Aave’s first deployment on a non-EVM blockchain. This strategic move is significant as it opens up new technological frontiers, diversifies Aave’s ecosystem, and underscores its commitment to innovation.\n\nBy leveraging Aptos’ innovative technology and developer community, Aave can address diverse financial needs, attract new users, and drive greater innovation in the DeFi sector. This deployment aligns with the Aave community’s strategic goal to explore new technological possibilities and tap into a wider pool of talent and resources.\n\nKey benefits of deploying Aave V3 on Aptos include:\n\n1. First Non-EVM Deployment:\n\n  * This deployment is a significant milestone as Aave’s first move beyond EVM-compatible blockchains. It positions Aave to explore and integrate with new blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its resilience and broadening its reach.\n\n2. Early Mover Advantage and Strong Brand:\n\n  * Aave is a leading brand in the DeFi space, with a strong reputation and market share. By deploying on Aptos, Aave captures early mover advantages on a high-performance blockchain, similar to its strategic expansions to Polygon and other L2s. This can attract both seasoned DeFi users and new participants exploring Aptos.\n\n3. Aptos' Strategic Position:\n\n  * The Aptos team, with their background from Meta's Diem project, has strong connections and expertise in finance, social and gaming sectors. Integrating Aave into Aptos complements these areas by adding a mature financial layer, essential for a complete blockchain ecosystem.\n\n4. High Transaction Throughput:\n\n  * Aptos supports up to [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), crucial for DeFi protocols like Aave that handle a high volume of transactions, including loans, repayments, and interest accruals. This high throughput can significantly enhance user experience and enable new use cases that require high-frequency transactions.\n\n5. Enhanced Security with Move Language:\n\n  * Aave v3 introduces sophisticated risk management tools and improved security protocols. The Move programming language used by Aptos has inherent security advantages, such as preventing reentrancy attacks. This alignment can lead to a more secure DeFi lending environment, leveraging Move's safety features and formal verification.\n\n6.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 MVP deployment on Neon EVM Mainnet\n\nAuthor: Neon Foundation & Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of Aave V3 MVP on the NEON EVM Mainnet, expanding Aave’s presence and enabling access to unaddressed users, liquidity, community and ecosystem of Solana.\n\n# Background:\n\nNeon EVM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment solution built on the Solana blockchain which makes it the first parallelized EVM with direct access to Solana liquidity. Neon EVM allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps on Solana and access its native ecosystem and network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities without changing their codebases. Neon EVM currently has interoperability with Solana SPL tokens and the plan is to develop full interoperability with Solana smart contracts as well in 2024.\n\nSolana is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. Solana ecosystem took a hit due to market conditions and FTX situation last year as TVL fell from all-time high of +$9b to +$250m in July 2023 but since then it has shown strong growth and it’s the fastest growing ecosystem across major blockchain networks. Current TVL is over $1.5b making it the fifth-largest chain by TVL.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave has emerged as a prominent player in DeFi lending across various EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, including Ethereum, alt L1s, and L2s. Neon EVM wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Neon EVM Mainnet to expand lending to the Solana ecosystem. Aave’s expansion to the largest non-EVM ecosystem will further reinforce its place as the top liquidity market on-chain and open up possibilities for growth and collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and Neon EVM communities.\n\nAave V3 deployment on Neon EVM will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Solana and enables Solana ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through Neon EVM. The platform will allow Aave to deploy on Solana without any reconfiguration of the Aave v3 codebase and hence without incurring major development efforts and costs to the Aave DAO. Also, a third-party team has already deployed Aave V3 fork on Neon EVM Devnet which implies the full compatibility of Aave V3 codebase with Neon EVM.\n\nThese benefits of Neon EVM combined with Aave’s impressive push for a cross-chain future, provide an exciting opportunity to capture the market share of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and grow the user base and community of the protocol, increase TVL, and protocol revenue. At the same time, Neon EVM would benefit from having a trusted, flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users and wider Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe deployment of Aave v3 on the Neon EVM would enable Aave to tap into the Solana DeFi market and make a unique and significant contribution to the decentralized finance movement. This deployment is expected to substantially reduce costs and better scalability in comparison to EVM networks, while also providing users with access to Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. As Solana gains momentum as a prominent blockchain platform, the integration of Aave’s advanced lending and borrowing protocol could further catalyze the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and Neon EVM.\n\nThere have been significant concerns around the Downtime of Solana blockchain in the past but continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new tools are rolling out on a continuous basis to make the network more resilient, efficient and scalable. For e.g. Firedancer 2 by Jump Crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of Aave v3 deployment on Neon EVM was also recently mentioned by Stani and contributing teams like Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). Tweet by Stani 26, Tweet by Marc Zeller 25\n\nAdditionally, Neon EVM also recently announced the launch of Neon Points Program 10 to attract users and builders to accelerate the adoption of the network. We will include Aave in our points program to incentivize user activity on Aave v3 on Neon EVM with boosted points.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Mainnet with limited deployment of initial assets and conservative risk parameters.This approach will enable Aave to strategically establish a presence in the Solana ecosystem while minimizing risk exposure.\n\nThe proposal suggests three collaterals (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL 1) and one borrowable asset (USDC) with no isolated mode, e-mode enabled for correlated assets (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL), conservative LTV and supply, borrow caps. If this proposal is to pass, we will conduct a comprehensive technical risk assessment for the suggested assets at the ARFC phase to determine their risk parameters. We also invite risk service providers and community members to provide their analysis.\n\n# Infraestructure\n\n- Documentation: [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/quick_start)\n\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Neon EVM supports almost all standards. Here is the link to supported JSON-RPC - [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods)\n\n- Indexers: theGraph\n\n- Oracles: Chainlink, Pyth\n\n- Wallets: Metamask, Ledger and support other EVM network wallets.\n\n- Block explorers: [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/),  [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/)\n\n- Address formatting: It is the same as the standard Ethereum address.\n\n- On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Friendly fork of Gnosis Safe.\n\n- Cross-chain Interactions: [deBridge](https://debridge.finance/) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance/status/1737812739320599032), expected to go live on Mainnet in January)\n\n- NeonPass: NeonPass links Solana and Neon EVM to provide a smoother EVM-compatibility experience for end users (https://neonpass.live/). NeonPass is the revolving door of liquidity between Solana and Neon EVM. NeonPass is not a bridge connecting two separate blockchain ecosystems. Rather, it acts as a two-way transfer tool for bringing assets in and out of the Neon EVM platform, which itself is a Solana smart contract directly connected to the network.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Neon Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Neon Foundation and holds SOL, NEON tokens.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM and proceed with Snapshot if positive.\n\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n# Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

    "summary": "The proposal to deploy Aave on Soneium, an Ethereum L2 developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, has strong community support and strategic rationale. The timeline metrics show unanimous and stable early support for YAE. Forum sentiment is mixed with more negative than positive comments, yet the most informed and detailed comments support deployment, highlighting the potential of leveraging Sony's ecosystem and the unique features of Soneium. Historical adjacent proposals with similar deployment themes have passed with strong support and positive community alignment. Market impacts of similar proposals showed moderate price declines but stable or positive TVL growth, indicating cautious but not adverse reactions. The recommendation aligns with maximizing long-term benefit by embracing strategic expansion into a promising ecosystem.",
