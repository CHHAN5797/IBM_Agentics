        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/599\n\n## Summary:\n\nProposal to add gauge support for 50/50 tBTC/WETH and 50/50 tBTC/USDbC pool on Base.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nLink to:\n\n* Website: https://threshold.network\n* Explorer: https://tbtcscan.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.threshold.network/\n* Github Page: https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2\n* Forum: https://forum.threshold.network/\n* Discord: https://discord.com/invite/Threshold\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/tBTC_project\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin, that is 1:1 backed by mainnet BTC.\n\nUnlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimised and redeemable for mainnet BTC without a centralized custodian.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThis proposal aims to add a veBAL gauge for the 50/50 tBTC/WETH pool and 50/50 tBTC/USDbC pool on Base.\n\nThreshold DAO seeks to build deep liquidity on Base, and Balancer is an ideal venue to build upon. These pools are key strategic pools, central to the long term growth strategy of Threshold DAO.\n\nThe DAO has budgeted T token bribes to incentivise this pool.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n### 1 Governance:\n\ntBTC operates on Threshold DAO’s decentralized threshold encryption protocol. Threshold DAO is governed by the network’s work token, T. T token holders govern the DAO via proposals raised to the Threshold forum, which can be raised to a vote via Snapshot, as well as the on-chain Governor Bravo module via Boardroom.\n\ntBTC contract deployments are currently managed via the Council multi-sig, a 6-of-9 multi sig managed by trusted community members: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\nIn the future, all contract authorities will be passed to the Governor Bravo contract.\n\n### 2 Oracles:\n\ntBTC does not rely on an oracle price feed.\n\n### 3 Audits:\n\nLeast Authority: https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-keep-network-tbtc-bridge-v2/\n\nChainsecurity: https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/threshold-network/\n\nCertik: https://skynet.certik.com/projects/threshold-network\n\nImmunefi Bug Bounty: https://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\n### 4 Centralization vectors:\n\nThreshold Network governance is decentralized, and updates are ratified by the DAO.\n\ntBTC contracts updates are currently managed by the Council multi-sig.\n\n### 5 Market History:\n\ntBTC is a wrapped BTC token, and is pegged to the price of BTC. Since launch, tBTC’s price has not significantly diverged from that of BTC. tBTC launched in January of 2023, and currently has ~2400 BTC to collateralize the ~2400 tBTC.\n\n### 6 Pool Details:\n\n#### tBTC/WETH Pool\n\nLink to Pool: [0x52e281318Fed4eFFfb8E46c0847a8f9B71a461A8](https://basescan.org/address/0x52e281318Fed4eFFfb8E46c0847a8f9B71a461A8)\n\nBase Gauge: [0xFA61fB6218378b9f01CA4B2b662B5c4d12915Db9](https://basescan.org/address/0xFA61fB6218378b9f01CA4B2b662B5c4d12915Db9)\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb)\n\n#### tBTC/USDbC Pool\n\nLink to Pool: [0x036d68e4e0005da4ef1c9ebd53b948d2c083495e](https://basescan.org/address/0x036d68e4e0005da4ef1c9ebd53b948d2c083495e#readContract)\n\nBase Gauge: [0x4321edfE7dEC773A91316481FCb19D6ca6Dc5207](https://basescan.org/address/0x4321edfE7dEC773A91316481FCb19D6ca6Dc5207)\n\nMainnet Gauge: [0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b](https://etherscan.io/address/0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b)\n\n### Value:\n\nThe Balancer tBTC pools will support tBTC routing and liquidity on Base.\n\nThreshold DAO has allocated a portion of its incentives budget to bribe these pools Paladin. This will incentivise veBAL holders to vote on our gauge to direct protocol emissions and attract TVL as part of the Base tBTC growth strategy.\n\n Specification:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0xF6FA773b5E54F4BD20E09d806AB483d58dD55dcb `\ngaugeType(string): `Base`\n\ngauge(address):`0x156cC29C8dfA80821eD240C3cA4BA85103e10f2b `\ngaugeType(string): `Base`",
