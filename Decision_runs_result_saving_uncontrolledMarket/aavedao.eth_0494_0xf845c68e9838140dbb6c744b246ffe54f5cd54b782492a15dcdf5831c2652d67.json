To maximise the upside for holding the strategic asset, the DAO needs a practical means of managing the asset.\n\nThe veBAL holding needs to be continually relocked to optimise goverance and rewards. Gauge votes are weekly and would require numerous AIPs to manage the veBAL effectively. Aave DAO also has an opportunity to participate in Balancer's governance on Snapshot votes via delegating governance rights.\n\nThe StrategicAssetManage will also hold the sdCRV position if approved by AIP. Yield generated from each strategic holding can be claimed, swapped and redeposited to compound into each strategy over time. The swaps have MEV protection and can be customised to have defined maximum amount of price impact.\n\nGiven the sheer volume and frequency of transactions to be performed, there exists a desire to minimum AIP votes. The StrategicAssetManager contains the ability for the `ShortExecutor` to assign an `AssetManager`. This role can be likened to a Treasury Committee (as suggested Part 4 of SM upgrade publications) and provides the DAO optionality to introduce a committee separte from this proposal once adequate guidelines are in place. \n\nThe contract contains an allow list which implements tight restrictions around which contracts the `AssetManager` role can interact with. Further definition relating to what the `AssetManager` can do will be defined in the [ARFC] publication.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the StrategicAssetManager:\n\n* Deposit/withdraw voteEscrow contract \n* Lock/relock B-80BAL-WETH\n* Participate in gauge votes\n* Delegate governance voting rights\n* Allocate boost\n* Update boost\n* Delegate boost\n* Allow boost on Warden \n* List boost on Warden (if the  DAO votes for it)\n* Claim protocol fees & other rewards \n* Transfer assets (ie: collector contracts)\n* Ability to lock other strategic assets\n* Receive assets from the collector\n* Receive assets from the Economic Reserve\n\nThe contract is upgradeable and controlled by Aave's [`Short Executor`](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide#the-short-executor-is-used-for-non-governance-related-proposals-such-as-asset-listing-parameter-upda) role via governance. Each function on the contract can be implemented via the `ShortExecutor` whilst also having the ability to assign and remove, a `AssetManager` role to a community elected address. There is also the possibility of having an IncentiveManager contract that could take on some of the listed functions defined above. These details will be worked through in the future.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance. The [ARFC] \npublication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].\n\n# Disclosure\n\n@llamaxyz is a service provider to Aave DAO. Llama is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is compensated by only Aave DAO for creating this ARFC. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The BB-A-USD token is to be deposited 50% directly into the Balancer gauge and 50% into Aura Finance's contract.\n\nAave DAO will earn BAL, AURA, swap fees and yield from Aave v3 via the linear pools. $3M is to be allocated to this strategy and the expected yield is around 9.3% without any boost from Aave's future veBAL holding.\n\nAave DAO will also gain the ability to create a BB-A-USD/GHO pool using BB-A-USD acquired by this proposal. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe current aethUSDC, aethDAI and aethUSDT holdings are shown below:\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.33.46.png](ipfs://bafkreifdz3sr45ieb77kmgsuzzir6ygvasygtstcd5rlyxipxd3gaz3v2u)\n The below shows the amount of DAI and USDT being migrated from Aave v2 to v3.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V2|USDT|3,119,535.51| $3,119,535.51 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V2|DAI|2,894,904.40| $2,894,904.40 |\n||||| $6,014,439.91 |\n\nThe table below shows the Aave v3 holdings after Part 2 of 3 has been implemented.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|3,155,411.89| $3,155,411.89 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|2,903,799.83| $2,903,799.83 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDC|58,173.59| $58,173.59 |\n|||||$6,117,385.31|\n\nAfter allocating $3.00M to BB-A-USD, Aave will have the following v3 holdings.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|1,655,411.89| $1,655,411.89 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|1,403,799.83| $1,403,799.83 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDC|58,173.59| $58,173.59 |\n|||||$3,117,385.31|\n\nThe aethUSDC is to remain deposited in Aave v3 and accumulate over time to facilitate any future Service Providers request for payment.\n\nAave also holds 4.5M of aUSDC on Aave v2 from Part 1 of 3 asset consolidation.\n\nWith the new [Aave v3 Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xfebb0bbf162e64fb9d0dfe186e517d84c395f016000000000000000000000502) created, gauge contract deployed and [Aura Finance integration](https://app.aura.finance/#/pool/81) complete, Aave DAO can now proceed attain the BB-A-USD and use it to earn yield. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.31.34.png](ipfs://bafkreicfefc3xsoel3sg64unqty4piq6pgzl44y6fza5i3544lh77tenvu)\n    \nAt the time of writing, routing a swap from stable coin to BB-A-USD incurs positive slippage. This is true for using all three stable coins. When setting the parameters for acquiring the BB-A-USD token, a maximum price impact of 0.20% will be used.\n\nThe methodology used for acquiring BB-A-USD will be the same approach used to acquire BB-80BAL-20WETH. \n\nIt has taken months to create a reusable approach that prevents MEV attacks and provides the ability to limit the price impact incurred when performing a swap. The methodology has been reviewed by Cowswap and Bored Ghost Developing.\n\nUpon receiving the BB-A-USD token, 50% is to be deposited into the Aura Finance contract and 50% is to be deposited directly into the Balancer gauge.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following asset holdings are to be redeemed and used for acquiring BB-A-USD.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|1,500,000| $1,500,000 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|1,500,000| $1,500,000 |\n\nDetailed execution details will be provided in the comments prior to submitting the AIP. This will enable Llama and Bored Ghost Developing to optimise the execution methodology.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). \n\n    ",

Assets from the v1, v2, RWA, ARC and AMM depoloyments all accumulate in the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract. This proposal is the first of several intended to consolidate the various Collector Contracts and Treasury holdings.\n\nThis proposal seeks to consolidate 17 assets in the v2 Ethereum Collector Contract to USDC and redeem ammTokens for the underlying assets. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe DAO is currently accunulating over 60 assets in the v2 Collector Contract from various Aave deployments. Many of these holdings are of small economic value, are undercollateralized assets, or exhibit volatile pricing behaviour. Upon consolidating the DAOs assets into USDC, which most of the DAO's costs are denominated in, Llama intends to present the community with suggested recommendations for deploying a portion of the larger holdings.  \n\nThe AMM Liquidity Pool, v2, attracts very little capital and usage relative to other deployments. A number of the assets are frozen and, with v3 being deployed on Ethereum soon, it makes sense for the DAO to relocate this capital away from from the v2 AMM deployment. This proposal enables the following ammTokens, aAmmDAI, aAmmUSDC, aAmmUSDT, aAmmWBTC, and aAmmWETH to be redeemed periodically by calling a contract. Any actor will be able to interact with the contract via Etherscan. Llama, or anyone else, can redeem these ammTokens periodically with the underlying asset to be held within the v2 Collector Contract.\n\n# Specification\n\nThie following assets held within the Ethereum v2 Collector Contract are to be converted to USDC via swap contract.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/THUOfbb.png)\n\nUsers will be able to deposit USDC and receive the tokens mentioned in the table above, plus a small premium. The premium is expected to reimburse the cost incurred from swapping the applicable token to USDC along with associated gas costs. The methodology enables actors to support Aave in swapping one asset for another by creating an arbitrage opportunity in a decentralized manner. \n\nThe following assets are to be redeemed from the AMM deployment.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dYnreQx.png)\n\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe below outlines at a high level the flow of events this proposal will acheive:\n\n1) Redeem aTokens and ammTokens for underlying asset\n2) Deploy a Swap Contract whereby actors can deposit USDC and receive a selected token stated in the above table at the Chainlink Oracle price + premium\n3) v2 Collector Contract receives USDC\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

There are several types of votes in other communities which are high context and time sensitive that can not be automated.\n\nAave would benefit from optimizing these resources in the most efficient way (i.e: Avoid Curve & Balancer gauges votes weekly on the Aave snapshot and/or management by AIP), and this publication presents the community with an opportunity to establish a voting framework and electing a voting committee.\n\nHow the committee is to vote wouldl be determined by an overall global strategy that is agreed/voted upon, by Aave governance.\n\n# Rationale:\n\nAs a reminder, veBAL positions offer the following benefits:\n\n* Gauge-weight Power: Voting power which influences emissions on the gauges.\n\n* Governance Power: Voting power in the DAO proposals\n\n* veBoost: Holding veBAL earns a boost up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided.\n\n* Protocol Fees: Part of the trading fees sold for bb-a-USD and claimable by lockers.\n\nThis proposal assumes that the veBAL position will be locked from the collector contract, and aims to define how these benefits should be managed.\n\n## Managing strategic assets on Collector Contract\n\nMost of the strategic assets are held on the Reserve Factor Mainnet, which is also where the treasury strategies will be deployed, so it makes sense to focus the whitelist proposals on this contract: `0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c` (which is the same for v2 and v3).\n\nHowever, DAO process are changing from one project to another, which can create incompatibilities:\n\n* Aave Governance is fully on-chain and only focused on protocols decisions, requiring most proposal to be approved by an AIP (which usually takes more than 1 week to be implemented)\n\n* Balancer Governance is also different (up to 1 year lock), governance power is off-chain, veBoost, gauge power and protocol fees claim are on-chain.\n\nMain benefits\n\n* bb-a-USD & BAL claim function from veBAL rewards is easy to add & automate on the collector contract\n* Governance is off-chain, and can be delegated via Snapshot.\n* veBoost can be utilized.\n* Aave holds a bigger supply share than CRV holdings\n\nMain issues\n\n* It’s not possible to delegate the gauge power on-chain which means that the collector contract would need to cast a new vote each time the veBAL allocation on gauges is updated.\n* New functions should be added on the collector contract to claim BAL from several gauges.where the Treasury could deposit.\n* As the voting power linearly decreases, the position requires to be relocked frequently to retain the max benefits. This part can be automated by Llama.\n* The potential locked holdings would represent ~1,48% of the veBAL supply (good but not enough to sustain Aave DAO various plans mentioned in Part IV)\n\nMoreover, the DAO could decide to allocate some funds on Balancer/Aura to optimize the yield, so these protocols should also be accessible from the reserve factor contract.\n\n### Collector Contract Considerations\n\nAs it would be very inefficient to require AIP for each transaction, this option considers whitelisting the voting committee to manage the strategic positions on the collector contract from the multisig.\n\nThis solution keeps the decentralized ethos of the Aave DAO but is also the most complex to implement than simply delegating the management of the assets to the committee multisig.\n\n* Implement all missing functions to interact with strategic protocols contracts such as Balancer/Aura, allowing to lock / periodically relock, claim, stake/unstake, updateBoost, add/remove liquidity, cast/update gauge votes\n* Elect the voting committee and create the associated multisig\n* Implement whitelists on the collector contract allowing the voting committee to handle the operations without requiring AIP for each transaction\n\n### Voting Committee\n\nThe voting committee would manage the following tasks by having its multisig whitelisted on the collector contract:\n\n* Lock/Relock the veTokens positions\n* Cast votes on gauges\n* Claim protocol fees\n* Claim gauges rewards\n* Update/sell veBoost\n* Follow the strategy profitability\n* Optimize amounts and create votes incentives\n* Claim unspent rewards & DAO vote incentives\n* Compound all strategic assets\n* Transfer all yield (or remaining yield to the collector contract)\n\n# Technical Implementation\n\n* Elect the voting committee\n* Deploy the multisig\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Proceed with Committee\n\nNAE - No Committee\n\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem. Some members of Llama are unpaid delegates in the Paladin ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.

Here, we propose that v2 aTokens be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury address. From the v3 Treasury address, the tokens can be deposited into Aave v3.\n\nUtilisation across the v2 deployment is low and there is excess liquidity within each reserve that enables Aave's aTokens to be redeemed without affecting users.\n\nLlama proposes migrating liquidity at the first available opportunity. There is also ongoing and soon to be expanded liquidity mining occurring on the Aave v3 deployment. \n\n## Consolidate Assets\n\nSimilar to a proposal relating to the [Ethereum v2 Collector Contract consolidation](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-collector-contract-consolidation/10909), we suggest swapping all JEUR, SUSHI, GHST + DPI to USDT. \n\nThe general flow of events is redeeming xSUSHI, GHST and DPI from the v3 Treasury and then swapping the assets for USDT.\n\n|Network|Deployment|Ticker|Price|Quantity|USD Value|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolDPI|$70.85|2.29| $ 161.96 |\n|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolSUSHI|$1.27|2,055.89| $ 2,610.97 |\n|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolJEUR|$1.05|2,622.03| $ 2,753.13 |\n|Polygon|Aave V3|aPolGHST|$1.04|2,788.45| $ 2,899.98 |\n|||||Total| $ 8,426.05 |\n\nWhy USDT, Aave holds more DAI and USDC on Polygon than USDT. If Aave was to deploy liquidity into a 3pool, then more USDT would be required when depositing equal amounts of each asset into the pool. The vlaue of the assets being swapped to USDT is very small relative to exisitng stable coin holdings. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following assets held within the v2 Collector Contract are to be redeemed and transferred to the v3 Treasury wallet.\n\nUsing 1inch's Fusion in auto mode perform the following:\n\n1. Redeem aPolGHST, aPOLjEUR, aPolSUSHI and aPolDPI\n2. Approve GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI\n3. Swap all GHST, JEUR, SUSHI and DPI to USDT\n4. Deposit USDT into Aave v3 USDT Reserve\n\nFusion offers MEV protection and Cowswap is not deployed on Polygon. \n\nContract Address references:\n\naPolGHST: `0x8Eb270e296023E9D92081fdF967dDd7878724424` \naPolSUSHI: `0xc45A479877e1e9Dfe9FcD4056c699575a1045dAA` \naPolDPI: `0x724dc807b04555b71ed48a6896b6F41593b8C637` \naPOLJEUR: `0x6533afac2E7BCCB20dca161449A13A32D391fb00`\nGHST: `0x385Eeac5cB85A38A9a07A70c73e0a3271CfB54A7`\nSUSHI: `0x0b3F868E0BE5597D5DB7fEB59E1CADBb0fdDa50a`\nDPI: `0x85955046DF4668e1DD369D2DE9f3AEB98DD2A369`\njEUR: `0x4e3Decbb3645551B8A19f0eA1678079FCB33fB4c`\nUSDT: `0xc2132d05d31c914a87c6611c10748aeb04b58e8f`\naPolUSDT: `0x6ab707Aca953eDAeFBc4fD23bA73294241490620`\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
