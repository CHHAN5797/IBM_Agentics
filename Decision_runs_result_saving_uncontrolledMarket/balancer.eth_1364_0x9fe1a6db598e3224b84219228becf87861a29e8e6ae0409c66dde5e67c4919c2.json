        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/307\n\n### Introduction\n\nThere are some significant changes compared to the last funding proposal and I welcome community feedback as always.\n\nNow that the treasury has a healthier supply of stablecoins and the DAO’s ongoing stablecoin costs look to be significantly lower in Year 2 I think it’s prudent to start paying the liquid portion of salaries in USDC. Thus the breakdown below will look a bit different from last quarter.\n\nWe’ll also be discontinuing Coordinape and adopting a bounty board for community contributors (this is based on feedback from the community and contributors themselves). We will share our learnings from our Coordinape experience soon. Previously 5000 BAL per month or $33,750 was allocated towards this, using last quarter’s BAL price of $6.75.\n\n10,000 USDC per month will be allocated toward the community bounty board. This is expected to compensate regular contributors with clear roles like Cosme, Gleb, and Dubstard for their ongoing work while allowing the opportunity for others to also pick up tasks. The Maxis will own the setup and management of this board and also provide a report on the spend in the monthly forum update.\n\nPreviously we requested 8550 BAL per month for salaries or $57,712. For Q3 we request 31,210 in USDC and 8475 in BAL per month or $68,500. The increase is driven by two factors:\n\n* Tritium’s salary is increasing a little over $5k vs last quarter - this better reflects a market salary for his skill set and his growing importance to the various operations of Maxis.\n* To partially make up for the loss of Coordinape each Maxi was given an additional 200 BAL or 1000 USDC (aside from Tritium)\n\nThis does mean each Maxi aside from Tritium is taking an effective pay cut as average Coordinape rewards per person exceeded the above figures. I believe this is prudent given the challenging market conditions where we must be trimming costs as much as we can.\n\n \n![bip-347-1.png](ipfs://bafkreick4g54svav42kw6jnj2ukvpuoc7f6idqjpv77x2fgnzshaqtlh7a)\n    \n\nLast quarter we asked for 1500 BAL for dev bounties. 875 BAL of that was spent, the details of which you can find in the below table. From this the Maxis have decided to pursue a retainer for Shakotan in the amount of 3000 USDC per month and 600 BAL to be max locked for the quarter. He will continue assisting us in our various Github repos to ensure our automated processes work as reliably and accurately as possible.\n\n \n![bip-347-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibj64iwi2uulfx4ml5pbttawvsjxezeficbd5fnjriwttcymik5v4)\n    \n\nFinally, we’ll ask for an additional 20 ETH from the treasury for gas expenses. You can check out [this dashboard](https://dune.com/scoffie/maxigasstation?undefined=) we commissioned to track gas spending. This may require supplemental funding during the quarter depending on ETH gas prices and if gas intensive activities increase, such as poking additional layer zero cross chain rate providers.\n\n----------------------------------------\n**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Solarcurve, joined by the returning cast of Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Danko, and Tritium.\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** Yes\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\nAs Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocol's future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or protecting the interests of the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis have proven to be a key component of Balancer.\n\nOur Q3 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group, and reading on previous [Q2 funding post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-230-fund-the-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2023/4562) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for April, May, and June.\n\n*Multisig Management*\n\n* Linear (boosted) pool settings\n* Swap fee and amplification adjustments\n* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL\n* Adding new reward tokens to gauges\n* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees\n* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig\n* Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig\n\nThese are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist – they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people.\n\n*Governance*\n\n* We act as verifiers of last resort for BIPs that require on-chain execution and we post BIPs ready for a vote on snapshot - though anyone with 200k veBAL can also post to snapshot.\n* Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics\n* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)\n* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process\n* Manage admin of the Governance Forum\n* We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group.\n\n*Automation and Tooling*\n\n* We work with Mimic to sweep and process our collected fees into USDC.\n* We run scripts that collect data and redirect fees to vote markets for veBAL holders to collect with their votes.\n* We build, deploy and fund [[Chainlink Automation Upkeeps](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers)](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers) which handle regular operations for veBAL, and incentive management for our strategic partners.\n* We continue to develop more reporting to help validate and verify submitted multisig payloads.\n* We track and organize governance operations through the transparent and open [Balancer Multisig Operations repository](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops).\n* We build and maintain internal tooling complex and common tasks such as pool creation and linear pool management.These tools are not polished/require some knowledge to operate, but we share them with some support in our bizdev and community support conversations.\n* Members of the Maxis, often supported by external grants, build and maintain analytics for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMaxis spend a good deal of time developing and conducting operational processes to keep fees flowing and governance systems operational and accurate. In 2023 we have started flexing our coding skills more and working to automate governance and partner liquidity management support operations in ways that are more “no-stop” and permissionless when possible.\n\n*Partnerships*\n\n* We manage Balancer’s Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed\n* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions\n* We often deploy new pools for other projects\n* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists\n* We help with UI testing for Balancer\n* Seek out new opportunities to apply Balancer’s technology, primarily in the DeFi realm\n* Manage relationships with partners across the entire lifecycle from initial conversations to implementation to final results\n* Coordinate partner needs with other teams in the Balancer ecosystem, e.g. integrations.\n\nMaxis took the lead on partnerships in the Balancer ecosystem during Q4 2022 after the biz dev team at Orb was dissolved. The primary near term goals are expanding boosted pool offerings focused primarily on Aave v3, encouraging adoption of ve80/20 or similar systems, making Balancer the hub of LST liquidity, and increasing utilization of the veBAL flywheel (projects bribing, parking POL, etc). Generally we believe Balancer has made solid progress over the last few months on these initiatives.\n\n*Community*\n\n* We manage a bounty board, open to community contribution\n* Onboarding framework for new contributors\n* Discord moderation and security\n* First responders to user support\n* Bridging the community inquires to other Service Providers\n\nThis quarter’s proposal represents a big shift from the framework inherited from the Ops subDAO and the Coordinape reward system. Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. However, we have learned that bounties can attract higher quality and project-oriented contributors that might be more likely to be retained. Soon we will share more about our experience using Coordinape.\n\nThis new approach will allow the community’s marketing efforts currently under the Maxis to be handed out to Beethoven’s team plans for [community developments](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810).\n\nThe legacy onboarding program will still be running, reaching every applicant through discovery calls to help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer.\n\n*Project Management*\n\n* Lead weekly meetings with team leads across the ecosystem to align on projects in flight\n* Be the driving force behind the ecosystem’s top roadmap priorities and be accountable for their delivery\n* Track project dependencies across the teams and coordinate among relevant parties\n\nMaxis assumed the role of project management for the ecosystem in Q1. We are well positioned for this as we are the point of contact for outside teams & projects and we have established working relationships with all internal teams. Our experience in executing various initiatives in the last 9 months means we have a lot of insight into what it takes to take a project from start to finish.\n\n*Record Keeping*\n\n* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\n3 months.\n\nBudget of 34,210 USDC per month for salaries and 8,475 BAL per month, plus Shakotan’s 600 BAL for the quarter. We also request an additional monthly allocation of 10,000 USDC per month for the bounty board and a quarterly allocation of 20 ETH for gas expenses.\n\n**Total for 3 month engagement: 132,630 USDC and 26,025 BAL and 20 ETH** (ETH is excluded in the following comparison).\n\n*Comparison against last quarter:* Using today’s BAL price of $4.4 we’re requesting $247,140 this quarter. Last quarter we requested 42,150 BAL at a price of $6.75 or $284,512. Thus this quarter’s funding proposal represents a reduction in costs of $37,372.\n\n**Funds to transfer:** 132,630 USDC and 25,400 BAL and 20 ETH (to reflect the unspent 625 BAL from last quarter’s dev bounties)\n\n*Impact on the Treasury*: The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 would cost around 0.5% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~12%.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325\n\n**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation:** N/A",

        "body": "**Service Provider Name:** Balancer OpCo (Product Team)\n\n**Core Contributor(s):** Gareth, Alberto, Anastas & Pon\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Introduction**\nBalancer OpCo Limited (or the “Balancer OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nSince the passing of [BIP-55](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-55-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco/3609) and its subsequent extension ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)), Balancer OpCo has been an integral element of the DAO since July 2022. This proposal aims to extend the product development services for an additional 6 months (April 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024). As in the previous proposal, the administrative and operational elements provided by Balancer OpCo are submitted as a separate proposal.\n\nOur primary roles include Frontend Team Lead (Gareth), Frontend Core Engineers (Anastas and Alberto), and Product Designer (Pon). We also contract Ansaf, a long-time community member and experienced frontend developer, on a part-time basis.\n\nThe proposal period has been reduced from 9 months to 6 months to align with other service providers. Balancer OpCo is requesting $373,290 and 15,711.56 BAL for 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\n**Retrospective**\nBalancer OpCo product team was previously funded ([BIP-351](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip351-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-product-team-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q1/4927)) for 9 months from July 1, 2023, through to March 31, 2024.\n\nOur high-level goals stated in the previous proposal are as follows:\n\n* Increase LP engagement and satisfaction.\n* Increase veBAL adoption and holder engagement.\n* Increase awareness and adoption of the Balancer protocol.\n\nThese goals have not changed and will continue to guide our focus as we build out v3 of the Balancer canonical app.\n\nBefore shifting focus to v3, our primary focus was to track and improve the general user/LP experience in the v2 app. The KPI we used to do that was the Transaction Flow Error Free Rate, which is fatal errors in transaction flows divided by the total number of successful transactions submitted through the UI. When we started tracking this in July 2023 we were at ~84%. A concentrated effort was made to fix all fixable bugs in those flows and by February 2024 we were able to improve that rate to ~95%. It’s possible with further concentrated effort we could improve that KPI by 1-2%, however, some portion of the remaining 5% are bugs and issues that can be very challenging to resolve, such as wallet errors and specific user network/device issues.\n\nAlthough our focus was generally on improving UX and supporting growth opportunities in the v2 app, very early on in our previous funding period it became clear that we would need to shift focus to a new canonical web application that would support both Balancer v2 and v3 vaults. The reasons behind this are outlined in our [November monthly update](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/opco-product-team-november-2023-update/5417). In November 2023 we publicly put the v2 app into maintenance mode and shifted our focus to the v3 app.\n\nDespite most of our focus being directed towards the v3 application, we have done our best to support growth opportunities in v2 as they arose. An example of this is quickly supporting LRT pools and making them easily findable. We recognise that opportunities for the Balancer ecosystem, like LRTs, are extremely important for the growth of the protocol and we will always do what we can to support marketing and partnership operations through improvements in the UI.\n\nIn September 2023, Tim who was responsible for our backend infrastructure moved on to a new opportunity. Tim had built our v2 API that still serves the v2 frontend application. For v3, we will be using the shared Beets/Balancer API which is managed by Franz at Beets. So we are not looking to hire a replacement and therefore our people costs for this funding cycle are lower.\n\n**Key Objectives and Success Metrics**\nOur key objective for this funding proposal is to launch the v3 web application. The primary motivation for building a v3 app is to build support from the ground up for both v2 and v3 vaults and make the app multi-network native, that is, users will be able to explore and interact with pools across all networks and vaults within the same app. This would have been extremely difficult to do well within the context of the v2 app. This objective also includes a complete rebranding of the Balancer UI/UX.\n\nWe have already made significant progress towards this objective and aim to launch a beta UI by mid-April 2024. Following the beta launch, we will complete support for the v3 vault and launch the UI to the general public alongside the launch of the v3 protocol. The current target for the v3 launch is the end of Q2, 2024.\n\nOur secondary objective is to begin to deprecate the v2 application and its supporting infrastructure. The supporting infrastructure such as the v2 API contributes to our costs and the quicker we can deprecate it the quicker we can lower Balancer OpCo’s 3rd party software costs.\n\nThe success metrics for these objectives are clear, the protocol needs a UI that can support the v2 and v3 vaults, and the UI development should not delay the launch of the v3 protocol. However, our success metrics, besides launching the new app and v3 support, remain essentially the same as with v2. Our focus is on improving the experience and engagement for LPs and veBAL holders. We are already tracking some relevant KPIs (Transaction Flow Error Free Rate & NPS). We will continue to track and report these KPIs as we launch the v3 app.\n\nIn summary, Balancer OpCo’s product team is committed to building a market-leading DApp for the Balancer protocol and supporting growth opportunities through UI development as they arise. The product team are passionate about Balancer and committed to its long-term success.\n\n**Ongoing commitments**\nThe Product Development team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI/UX available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\n* Build, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\n  * We aim to provide the best possible experience for users to provide liquidity, swap, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\n  * We will design, build and maintain the marketing pages for the Balancer protocol. The primary aim of these pages will be to inspire and help onboard potential partners into the ecosystem.\n  * We ensure this UI works across all modern devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\n  * We will continually optimize and improve this app so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer introduces in the future.\n  * We will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit, integration and eventually E2E (End to End) tests.\n  * Whenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\n  * This also includes responsibility for all copywriting across the app.\n* Ecosystem design support\n  * We will support broader ecosystem design initiatives. For example, we’ll collaborate with marketing on creative direction and occasional asset production.\n* Support the development and maintenance of the shared Beets/Balancer API\n  * The Product Development team currently maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information, as well as a SOR interface that services such as CowSwap use to calculate the best trade routes through Balancer pools.\n  * The existing API mentioned above will be deprecated in favour of the shared Beets/Balancer API at https://api-v3.balancer.fi.\n  * Additional functionality will be added to the shared Beets/Balancer API to support a simpler UI layer for v3.\n* User support\n  * We will monitor relevant channels in Discord, Slack and Github issues for any reported problems and aim to respond within 24 hours and fix the problem as soon as possible.\n* OpCo operations\n  * Manage DNS for all Balancer DAO domains.\n  * Manage user accounts/email addresses under those domains.\n  * Manage 3rd party accounts, upgrades, renegotiations, etc. For example, RPC providers, AWS, and wallet check providers.\n\nGithub repositories that we are directly responsible for:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v3\n* https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v2 (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-api (v2 API, to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/tokenlists\n* https://github.com/balancer/marketing-site (to be deprecated)\n* https://github.com/balancer/metadata\n\nGithub repositories we are not directly responsible for but contribute to:\n\n* https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk\n* https://github.com/balancer/docs\n* https://github.com/balancer/backend\n\n**Reporting**\nThe Product Development team is committed to transparency and openness in all our work. The majority of our day-to-day activities can be followed via the previously mentioned repositories. We are also committed to providing higher-level reporting on our work in the relevant calls and on the forum. Our reporting commitments will be as follows:\n\n* Weekly v3 roadmap call\n  * Audience: Internal, engineering and ecosystem leadership.\n  * Here we share status updates on our latest work and take note of any urgent requirements or future work for our team.\n* Monthly forum update\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A high-level written report of work done over the past 30 days, including how that work relates to our stated goals. We will also include reflections on challenges that may be standing in the way of progress on those goals.\n  * Relevant metrics that the Product Development team’s work has a direct impact on.\n* Quarterly community call update (if applicable)\n  * Audience: Public\n  * A higher-level update on the work done over the last quarter and work planned for the next quarter, including KPIs and visual content if relevant. This update will also include reflections on the team and its performance and any changes to the overall direction described in this funding proposal or previous quarterly reports.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget**\nBalancer OpCo product team is requesting 6 months of funding starting April 1, 2024 and ending September 30, 2024.\n\nWe request a total budget of $373,290 for the full period. Note that Balancer OpCo holds enough funds to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by OpCo and other Service Providers vs their original budgets in years 1 and 2. For that reason, no new funding is required from the DAO for this proposal. The table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter.\n![bip-565-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibzvgelwxzehhvztwqftrggjbhvbum4k6rhjj6i5abtoryqhpgoom) \n\nNote that Non-People Costs are reduced in Q2 as we transfer some of those costs into the Balancer OpCo Admin & Ops [supplementary proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628). These costs are for 3rd party services that are used throughout the ecosystem and are critical to the ongoing operation of the DAOs infrastructure. We are referring to these as “Protocol Infrastructure”.\n\nA further breakdown of the Balancer OpCo Product Team costs is shown below:\n![bip-565-1.png](ipfs://bafkreigag7amrn6sougc46ncjc57gyaoioz3o4qgsbyhwsntolcqzsdjei)\n    \n\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting an allocation of 15,711.56 BAL for the 6 month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. This BAL would be awarded as compensation to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 2 quarter proposal period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff.\n\n**Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo)**\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the Balancer DAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.",

        "body": "https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/701\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Beethoven X DAO\n\n**Core Contributor(s):** franz, groninge, daniel\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88?pvs=21) (or link to your own):** Yes\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1?pvs=21):** Yes\n\n**Introduction & Domains of Operation:**\n\nSince the passing of [BIP-254](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-254-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao/4652) and it’s subsequent extension ([BIP-393](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-393-fund-beethoven-x-dao-technical-for-aug-dec/4958) and [BIP-394](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-394-fund-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-for-aug-dec/4973)), the Beethoven X DAO has functioned as a Balancer Service Provider since May 1, 2023. This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (January 1, 2024 - June 30, 2024). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a [separate proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xx-funding-proposal-for-the-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-sp-jan-jun-24/5406).\n\nOur primary roles include API team lead (franz), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). While the past nine months have been turbulent at times, we strongly believe it has once again demonstrated the resilience of the Balancer DAO and the entire ecosystem. Despite a [key service provider winding down](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-orb-collective-s-path-forward/4778), several core contributors stepping down, and a [critical vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-found-in-some-pools/5102), we are collectively still here, building.\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for Balancer to regain narrative and establish ourselves as the platform to empower current and future AMM innovation. We are hugely optimistic in the future of Balancer Protocol and steadfast in our dedication to support the ecosystem to the best of our abilities. As we work towards Balancer V3, it has been inspiring to participate in the development of a more cohesive technology stack to empower the future of the protocol. A technology stack that leverages the collective experiences and expertise of contributors across the ecosystem, avoiding siloed development strategies that lead to unnecessary system complexity in Balancer V2.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broader ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. As we continue to find the best way to bring value to the Balancer ecosystem, we welcome community feedback.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nThree Rocks recently [announced](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/integrations-team-three-rocks-november-2023-update/5408) their decision to wind down effective December 2023. Both @rabmarut and @gerg have been long time contributors to the Balancer ecosystem. We’d like to extend a thank you to the entire Three Rocks organization, they are a team of talented engineers who made countless contributions to the protocol as well as serving as the technical interface to external partners, they will be missed. \n\nOver the last few months, there has been ecosystem wide discussions around the future of integrations at Balancer, resulting in with what we see as a very positive outcome to a challenging situation. Effective January 2024, the responsibilities of the integrations team will transition to Balancer Labs under the leadership of John Grant. With John Grant’s extensive knowledge of the entire Balancer ecosystem and the support of existing Three Rocks team member @Mkflow27, integrations will become a part of what is currently the Balancer Labs SDK team. With expertise in both on- and off-chain integrations into Balancer Protocol, we see this team as being well suited to fill the gap left by Three Rocks. While John is on a well deserved parental leave, I have been working directly with mkflow to help facilitate a smooth transition.\n\nWe’d additionally like to extend a huge thanks to Fernando and the entire Balancer Labs team for their willingness to take on the responsibilities and costs for integrations moving forward. This significantly reduces the operational costs incurred by the DAO, and is yet another example of Balancer Labs' ongoing commitment to the long-term success of the Balancer protocol.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nBalancer V3 has been the core focus of the Smart Contracts team for the majority of the last two quarters. While the feature set has not yet been publicly disclosed, we are extremely excited about the technical direction of Balancer V3. Architecturally speaking, there has been a focus on:\n\n- Interface design - with the overarching goal of making it significantly easier to integrate with Balancer protocol.\n- Reducing overall system complexity\n- Improved code readability by reducing inheritance depth and leveraging libraries for composition.\n\nInternally, the smart contracts team is on track to complete its second major milestone at the end of this year, a first MVP of the core contracts of Balancer V3. It has been an absolute pleasure collaborating closely with @juani, @endymionjkb and @ylv. I think I can speak for the entire team when I say that we’re very much looking forward to sharing more details on Balancer V3 publicly.\n\n**SDK**\n\nProgress on the new [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) has continued over the past two quarters, and it is fast approaching feature complete for Balancer V2. In contrast to the existing [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk), the new b-sdk is highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API, allowing the SDK to be focused in its goals. The SDK team has additionally been a huge contributor in interface design for Balancer V3, their in-depth understandings of V2 integration pain points have been invaluable in the process.\n\nAn important initiative worth highlighting is the cross-organizational effort to implement a generalized approach for [price impact calculations](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk/blob/d8dc287253160d20c877a57ac4c4c60190b22770/src/entities/priceImpact/index.ts) in the b-sdk. Spearheaded by @brunoguerios from the SDK team and @ZenDragon from the Maxis, their efforts have produced a first iteration of a generalized approach that will reliably calculate price impact for all pool actions, irrespective of the underlying invariant implementation. This is a massively valuable development for the entire ecosystem.\n\n**Frontend**\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for a new take on the existing frontend application. OpCo and Beethoven X contributors have spent the last several months laying the groundwork on a new version of the Balancer Frontend. With a fresh new look, the new Balancer Product will be:\n\n- Multi-chain native to allow for quick exploration of liquidity pools across all Balancer supported networks.\n- API powered to facilitate fast loading times, overcoming many of the data challenges plaguing the current V2 application.\n- Version agnostic to ensure that any liquidity that stays on V2 will benefit from the streamlined UX.\n- Designed with a flexible architecture, with the goal to easily support all current and future pool types.\n\nLed by @gareth, OpCo and Beethoven X contributors are collectively leveraging their extensive Balancer domain knowledge to build a better product.\n\n**API**\n\nAs the limitations of the subgraph have been a constant bottleneck for V2, the Balancer Labs Data team, lead by @mendesfabio, have made the decision that future versions of the Balancer subgraph will be focused primarily on data extraction (E). This is in recognition that the API is better suited for the role of data transformation (T) and loading (L). As the API will play an important role in the Balancer tech stack, former SDK team member Jarek has transitioned to the API team and we expect that there will be a close collaboration between the API and Data teams as we move towards Balancer V3.\n\nBelow, we present general API updates, written by Beethoven X DAO contributor franz, API team lead:\n\nOver the last months, our main effort went into getting the API ready for the new frontend-v3 and the b-sdk. As the frontend aims to serve a multi-chain user experience, the API must also support these requirements. Working closely together with OpCo, requirements for queries have been defined and implemented one-by-one as they are needed in the development process. \n\nMany other, smaller changes have also been integrated into the API to support data needs for the new frontend such as specific filters, rate provider data, FX pools support or yield fee specifics.\n\nAdditionally, the API is also used in the new b-sdk to “enrich” pool data that is being used for various pool operations. Together with Balancer Labs we defined the requirements for the API and integrated the changes. These requirements mainly comprise specific needs on nested pools, token indexes or other token data.\n\nAdditional points of interest:\n\n- In August, BASE chain was integrated into the API which is responsible for serving pricing data to the UI.\n- Optimizations have been made to the infrastructure deployment that resulted in a more cost effective solution. In addition, more changes are planned that should further reduce the cost of operating the infrastructure.\n- On November 27th, we successfully deprecated the veBal voting-gauges.json file in GitHub in favor of the API. All known partners have migrated and will query the API in the future. With this change we automate a manual operations task, reducing manual work.\n- We have helped the community in Discord with questions regarding development, inner workings of the UI and API, to help them understand the liquidity mining or voting processes from Balancer and with general questions.\n- We’ve supported the Balancer Maxis with their data needs for the gauge rewards automation program. Also, showcasing the rich data set that the API has on Balancer pools and how to make use of it.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort. How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n- **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting January 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2023.\n\nWe request a budget of $29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory. The increase of $4,000 USDC per month reflects increased involvement from groninge on the development of the new v3 frontend.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

Recognized as key contributors and the vital link between partners and the protocol, our dedication to the DAO is unwavering. As we embark on another quarter, our commitment is not just to continue, but to evolve – to redefine our engagement and amplify our positive impact on the DAO in 2024.\n\nThe third quarter marked a significant transition for the Maxis. Following the departure of our strategic visionary, Solarcurve, we embraced change and innovation. Tritium rose to the occasion, leading critical initiatives like the [core pool incentive automation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-457-core-pool-incentive-program-automation/5254), as well as securing and executing on the Arbitrum STIP, demonstrating our adaptability and resilience.\n\nOur evolution goes beyond roles and responsibilities. The Maxis are transforming from a collective of passionate enthusiasts to a team of full-time, professional experts. The new full-time addition consists of @Xeonus who will spearhead our strategic direction.\n\nOur mindful approach to funding allocation ensures an efficient use of resources – balancing USDC and BAL demands with maximum effectiveness. Our focus is not just on growth but on impact and transparency.\n\nIn 2024 we want to make the most impact by driving forward exciting initiatives while providing excellent mission-critical services to the DAO. We have identified four main (non-v3 dependent) initiatives to channel our efforts, while continuing to provide the core services that have been the backbone of the DAO for over two years.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nBeyond regular operations, the Maxi’s are focused on trying to create successful narratives in the Balancer ecosystem through various focused initiatives. In 2024, we strive to focus on a few of them, ensure that our focus areas have a clear leader/champion and some defined goals and that time and resources are available to focus on these topics. The impact of those topics is directly related to the achieved objectives.\n\n### Initiative 1: Growth beyond Mainnet\n\nLead: Tritium\n\nTeam: Shakotan (tech and operations), Xenous (data)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Grants Committee, Beethoven (Marketing + Beets grants)\n\nSummary\n\nThe initiative aims to further strengthen the DAO's presence beyond mainnet, focusing on Arbitrum, zkEVM, and Gnosis. The initiative emphasizes the successful execution of the Arbitrum STIP, but most of all development of strong competencies in creating data-driven narrative showcasing Balancer’s competitiveness, and collaboration with key blockchain partners such as Polygon and Aribtrum. The strategy includes adaptability to pivot based on market trends and performance metrics and an ever growing understanding of the KPIs that our grant providing partners care about.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Timely STIP Execution: Ensure punctual and successful delivery of the current STIP, including consistent reporting and active engagement with the DAO.\n2. Data Narrative Development: Work to build a competency within Balancer to tell stories about how we are using our emissions to drive growth for our protocol and in the ecosystems we exist in.\n\n  1. We should be able to put out velodrome style reports that tell our story.\n\n3. KPI-Focused Program Management: Stay close to various grant programs and look at successful grant recipients to understand the KPIs they set and how they achieve them.\n\n  1. Propose changes at Balancer to make this possible or point out why we are not well suited to meet the kinds of KPIs that chain ecosystems see value in.\n\n4. Next Grant Cycle Preparation: Identify potential grant sources for the upcoming cycle and strategize engagement.\n5. Feedback Integration: Actively seek and incorporate feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the initiative.\n6. STIP Comparative Analysis: Collaborate with the STIP body to assess and report on Balancer's performance in comparison to peers.\n7. Impact Report Creation: Develop a comprehensive report detailing the impact of extra incentives delivered through balancer on L2 ecosystems.\n8. Strategic Partnerships: Strengthen collaborations with Gnosis Chain, Base, Arbitrum and Polygon to share successes and apply learnings, particularly in the context of zkEVM scaling.\n9. Collaborate with Beets as much as possible to create a shared competency here.\n\n### Initiative 2: Redesign of the Gauge Framework v1\n\nLead: Xeonus\n\nTeam: Shakotan (building automation), Tritium, Zekraken, Zen Dragon and Mike B (design)\n\nSummary\n\nThis initiative aims to introduce an automated, dynamic system for evaluating and adjusting gauge emissions based on performance metrics. This new framework is designed to efficiently allocate BAL rewards, optimizing support for both high-cap and emerging projects. The goal is to ensure a more responsive and adaptable system that balances revenue optimization with nurturing potential future revenue generators.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Automated Gauge Evaluation: Develop a system for automatic assessment of gauges based on predefined metrics.\n2. Dynamic Emission Cap Adjustments: Implement a mechanism to adjust emission caps (ranging from 2% to 10%) based on gauge performance, potentially reducing underperforming gauges to a certain cap (e.g. 0.5%).\n3. Adaptive Framework: Ensure the framework is responsive to market dynamics and capital efficiency, allowing for more flexible and efficient allocation of BAL rewards.\n4. Rules around Duplication: Rules for handling the same Token in multiple pools/chains or the same DAO with multiple tokens.\n\n### Initiative 3: Support Balancer v3 Design\n\nLead: Mike B\n\nTeam: Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Tritium, Shakotan(tech and automation)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs, Beethoven (Tech)\n\nSummary: Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It's crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n2. Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings like TWAMMs, boosted pools, and dynamic ECLPs, and effectively pitch these to ecosystem projects.\n3. Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n4. Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n5. Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n### Initiative 4: Automation ownership transfer & on-chain automation improvements\n\nLead: Shakotan\n\nTeam: Tritium\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs\n\nSummary:\n\nOngoing automation for both on-chain and off-chain processes. Improving existing operational contracts, such as Gauge injector and improving Defender codebase so it becomes maintainable.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. OZ Defender automation takeover from Balancer Labs and Markus\n2. Full tech and development for on-chain tasks\n3. ChildGaugeInjector version 2 release with new features + factory deployment to support better events and data used by Data Team\n4. Potential fees-handler-sc implementation to reduce rugability of the fees bags + improve data flow.\n\nService Provider Name & Overview: Balancer Maxis\n\nLeader(s): Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Danko, Tritium, Shakotan and Gosuto\n\nContributors (a.k.a.

Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q1 2024 would cost around 0.9% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.3M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.5% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~10%.\n\nFurthermore, this table provides an overview of the last years impact putting this proposal into perspective:\n\n|Year|Quarter|BAL|BAL Price|USDC|ETH|ETH price|Operations cost|People cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|2023|Q1|48000|$6|$0.00|0|1201|0|$266,400|$266,400.00|\n|2023|Q2|42150|$7|$0.00|5|1795|8975|$291,257|$300,231.50|\n|2023|Q3|26025|$5|$132,630.00|20|1853|37060|$251,825|$288,884.50|\n|2023|Q4|31695|$3|$168,770.00|20|1652|33040|$271,779|$304,819|\n|2024|Q1|35718|$4|$108,095.00|20|2170|43400|$250,969|$294,369|\n\nAlthough the Maxis will have around 1 FTE more manpower at their disposal, the impact on the treasury stays nearly the same. Maxis have undergone internal optimizations in pay to reduce the impact on the DAOs USDC as much as possible given the current market conditions. In that regard, 49.5% of requested funding will be locked in our stkauraBAL vesting contract. We will also roll over $37,720.00 in savings from our Q3 and Q4 budget (bizdev, bounties etc.) and deduct that amount from the current proposal, which further reduced our overall demand for USDC.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\nLink to SLA (if going through the Foundation): N/A\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `108095` USDC as `108095000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `35718` as `35718000000000000000000`\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with WETH `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` by writing `deposit` with amount `20` to wrap the required ETH.

Recognizing this, both Balancer and Beethoven X have continually expressed a desire to work closer together.\n\nIn an effort to accelerate the collaboration, Balancer Labs engaged Beethoven X contributors in a 3-month trial contract beginning on February 1, 2023. This collaboration has allowed both teams to leverage each other's strengths and work together to drive technical innovation for the Balancer DAO.\n\nAs Balancer pursues its path towards further decentralization, we believe the inclusion of the Beethoven X DAO in its pool of service providers would represent a significant step in furthering this goal.\n\nIn this proposal, we will provide an update on the progress of the collaboration and present our plans for the future. We believe that by working collaboratively, we can achieve greater efficiency and drive innovation for the benefit of the entire Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Balancer API**\n\nBeethoven X launched a custom UI in August 2022, with the goal of providing a fast and smooth user experience. To facilitate this goal, a significant amount of energy and resources were invested into the development of a custom backend API.\n\n[https://github.com/beethovenxfi/beethovenx-backend/](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/beethovenx-backend/)\n\nWhile OpCo has also been in the process of developing their own API, it was recognized that the Beethoven X API is in a more mature state and both sides would benefit from collectively supporting and building on a single API moving forward. Over the last two months, members from OpCo, Balancer Labs and Beethoven X have worked collaboratively to deploy a joint API infrastructure that will service both Balancer and Beethoven X moving forward:\n\n[https://api-v3.balancer.fi/](https://api-v3.balancer.fi/)\n\nOpCo has started the process of integrating the API into the Balancer UI, which should serve to provide a smoother UX in many ways. The success of this project speaks to the collaborative nature of all teams involved.\n\n**Scaffold-balancer**\n\nAs part of the roadmap planning for Q1 of 2023, Beethoven X contributors proposed the development of a suite of tools that could make it significantly easier to start developing a custom pool contract on top of the Balancer protocol.\n\n[https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer](https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer)\n\nScaffold-balancer is a fork of the well known scaffold-eth project geared specifically around facilitating the rapid prototyping of new Balancer pool types. We strongly believe that if we make it simple to get started and succeed early, it will provide developers the motivation and inspiration to slowly peel back the layers of complexity that is the Balancer protocol and develop something truly innovative.\n\nCurrent feature set:\n\n* Generic Pool UI - Allows you to interact with any existing or locally deployed pool contracts, making the time-to-test significantly shorter. The UI focuses on single contract actions (swap/join/exit) for both query and tx submission.\n* SOR Playground - Provides granular config on the pools, tokens, types, etc that are included into the routing. The idea being that you can provide tight constraints around the dataset to see how your custom pool performs when benchmarked against existing liquidity, although it could also quite easily be used to benchmark the performance of the SOR generally.\n* Batchswap builder - A UI for building arbitrarily complex batch swaps.\n\nBeyond the initially developed feature set, João from Orb integrations has also started to build out [managed pool controller examples inside scaffold-balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-march-2023-integrations-update/4613).\n\nWhile still in its infancy, we believe this tool already provides significant value to developers looking to start the journey of developing their own custom pool on Balancer.\n\n**SDK / SOR**\n\nThe existing SOR was built before the widespread adoption of BigInt math and the advent of boosted pools. As the number of deployed pools has continued to grow, the existing SOR has come up against performance limitations. Mike McDonald recently initiated a project to rewrite the SOR with a focus on speed and performance. We’ve supported Mike in this process, including implementing a novel graph traversal algorithm for path finding that is boosted pool native.\n\n[https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk)\n\nThe implementation of a robust API has presented an opportunity to rethink the role that the Balancer SDK should fill. This repo will become the home of the new Balancer SDK.\n\n**Technical Advisor**\n\nWhile I (daniel) am a builder at heart, I’ve worked in senior developer and CTO roles for the better part of 10 years, and have worked professionally as a software developer for 15 years. The Balancer Labs leadership has been incredibly open and allowed me to begin to play a larger role across the entire ecosystem. Over the last several months, I’ve started attending regular ecosystem meetings, engaged in conversations on product development, participated in partnership discussions, and taken a role in helping to collaboratively define the future of the Balancer SDK.\n\n**Marketing, content and design**\n\nOver the past 18 months the Beethoven X marketing team have established a brand that has come to be recognised for not only its unique personality but its approach to community building and content creation. Our goal has been to build a competent community of engaged users that are as passionate about our ecosystem as we are.\n\nThe focus for our marketing efforts has been centered around producing high quality educational material on the underlying technology as well as cultivating an ethos of care and compassion for our community. Combining a strong visual aesthetic with an approachable brand identity has allowed our content, voice and style to flourish and has cemented our place as one of the top DeFi protocols on Fantom and Optimism.\n\nWeekly newsletters, threads, docs, NFTs, giveaways, community competitions, animations, long form articles, ambassador programs, live events, and financial reporting has enabled community members to keep up to date with the Beethoven X ecosystem.\n\nBuilding from a foundation of innovation that intertwines within current trends, social narratives and symbiosis offers the opportunity to establish a flourishing community base that is educated and empowered to engage in the ecosystem.\n\nWhile not part of the original agreement, we set forth to showcase this competency. For the past 3 months the marketing team has started to work on the following initiatives.\n\n**Landing Page**\n\nAs part of the roadmap planning for Q1 2023, Beethoven X contributors proposed the development of a landing page that clearly, concisely and with strong visuals, answers the question that is at the center of the growth of Balancer as a platform. “Why should I build on Balancer?” To date, 10 in-depth interviews have been performed with developers and key contributors across the Balancer ecosystem, and work has begun on developing a cohesive storyline. The landing page will intertwine strong visual design with technical information to create an engaging experience that highlights what sets Balancer apart.\n\n**Social Media & Design**\n\nBeethoven X contributors have started developing a framework for the evolution of the Balancer social media presence. The goal is to create a strong visual identity that not only showcases the technical capabilities of Balancer but also embodies a compelling personality that leverages current trends and social narratives, similar to what we strive for with the Beethoven X brand.\n\n**Content Creation**\n\nBeethoven X contributors have started producing in depth twitter threads on relevant topics in the Balancer ecosystem:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1643985415135952896 \n](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1643985415135952896)https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1633490690788462592\n\nand kickstarted a technical article series:\n\n[https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/inside-balancer-contracts-a-composable-symphony-1-229f6e90224](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/inside-balancer-contracts-a-composable-symphony-1-229f6e90224d)\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:** \n\n* **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n* **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort. How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n* **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\nOur strategy for Balancer marketing would be to highlight the major benefits of Balancer protocol across its user demographics in an engaging, informative manner. The focus of this strategy would be to educate users on product innovation, current trends and partnership developments. Coupled with engaging design / visuals the strategy stands to bring Balancer back into the limelight on social media and hopefully ignite a flywheel for growth based on relevancy, product and community.\n\nBalancer has never been more successful than it is today and we would strive to complement its immense success.\n\nIn this regard there are 2 key focuses:\n\n- **Brand Development** - Encapture the core brand values and inspire. Although a reputable figure, there is room to create an inspirational brand aesthetic that speaks well to current trends in a timeless, tasteful fashion.\n- **Social Presence** - Building from a foundation of insightful content and leveraging an unique aesthetic, social presence represents Balancer’s voice. As a thought leader in the industry the goal for the  Balancer voice is to showcase competency and relevancy through  social media outlets in a playful, engaging manner.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\nBeethoven X is requesting 3 months of funding starting May 1, 2023 and ending July 31, 2023. \n\nWe request to continue the budget of $25,000 USDC (or BAL equivalent) per month for technical development and advisory. Additionally, we strongly believe that Beethoven X contributors can provide significant value in the areas of marketing, content creation and design. For this effort, we propose an additional budget of $15,000 USDC (or BAL equivalent) per month.\n\nAs these funds will be used to cover a portion of contributor salaries, we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form. If approved, $40,000 USDC or BAL equivalent would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",
