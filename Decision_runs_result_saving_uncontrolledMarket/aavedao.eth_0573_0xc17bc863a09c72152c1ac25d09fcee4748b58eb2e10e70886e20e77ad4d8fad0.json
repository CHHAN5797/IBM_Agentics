        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to whitelist deBridge, a generic messaging and cross-chain interoperability protocol, for Portals V3 on all chains where Aave v3 is deployed – with credit lines for USDC ($4M per chain), USDT ($4M per chain), and ETH (2000 ETH per chain).\n\n## Overview\n\n**[deBridge](https://debridge.finance/)** is a generic messaging and cross-chain interoperability protocol that enables decentralized transfers of arbitrary data and assets between blockchains. The protocol is an infrastructure platform and framework for:\n- Cross-chain composability of smart contracts\n- Cross-chain swaps (deSwap is one of the applications built on top of deBridge that enables capital-efficient cross-chain swaps)\n- Bridging of any arbitrary asset and data\n- Interoperability and bridging of NFTs\n\nIn deBridge, we strongly believe in the concept of composable finance where a combination of different DeFi primitives or protocols enables solutions with the highest level of capital- efficiency that can’t be achieved by standalone protocols or applications. deBridge was designed to be fully compatible with the existing DeFi ecosystem, and **[deSwap](https://app.debridge.finance/deswap)** is a good example of this. It leverages deBridge’s generic messaging framework in order to provide users and protocols with the ability to perform a capital-efficient cross-chain conversion between arbitrary liquid assets, all in one transaction\n\nMore information about deSwap can be found **[here](https://blog.debridge.finance/any-arbitrary-cross-chain-swaps-with-debridge-1inch-network-862212087d6a)**. \n\n\nInstead of reinventing the wheel and developing a dedicated AMM or DEX, we integrated with Curve to utilize its capital-efficient stableswap AMM and partnered up and integrated with the liquidity aggregator 1inch. This design allows deSwap to source liquidity and routing from existing protocols. This is much more effective than running meaningless liquidity mining campaigns to have a ton of idle liquidity sitting as TVL with near-zero utilization. We truly believe it's more reasonable to source liquidity from a protocol like AAVE when it's needed and to do revenue sharing between the protocols. \n\n**Portals enable a great synergy between deBridge and AAVE** by bringing additional utilization for locked liquidity in AAVE as well as providing a new type of routing for cross-chain swaps through deSwap, where no intermediary pools or wrapped tokens are needed. In addition, the integration will facilitate atomic transfers of positions between Aave instances on different chains which ease cross-chain interactions with no need to switch wallets/networks.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\ndeBridge is an infrastructure for developers and projects to integrate with or use to build any type of cross-chain applications and primitives. The design of the deBridge protocol consists of two layers:\nProtocol layer – on-chain smart contracts deployed on every blockchain supported by deBridge.\nInfrastructure layer – off-chain validation nodes operated by validators that are elected by and work for deBridge governance. (List of active validators can be found [here](https://explorer.debridge.finance/validation-progress).\n\nMore details about the technical implementation and design of the deBridge protocol can be found in our [documentation portal](https://docs.debridge.finance/).\n\nThe protocol has been live since February and has processed over $45M in volume, 80k+ cross-chain transactions, 45k+ unique users, and generated over $120,000 in fees for the protocol and validators securing the network. \n\nThe major activity in the protocol has been generated by deSwap, a cross-chain swap solution built on top of the deBridge generic messaging protocol. deSwap enables decentralized cross-chain conversion of arbitrary liquid assets. Here is some useful information: \n\n**If applicable the number of routers, total liquidity of routers**\nCross-chain swaps are currently routed through the deUSDC/deETH liquidity pools at Curve protocol which have ~$9M of liquidity provided by deBridge users and partners. A complete list of liquidity pools can be found here: Cross-Chain Swaps Liquidity - deBridge\n\n**Is liquidity incentivized?**\nAt this moment liquidity is not incentivized. Liquidity providers receive 2 BPs in the form of trading fees from Curve. Anyone can provide liquidity to the protocol.\n\nOnce control over the protocol is passed to governance, there is a plan to submit a governance proposal to the deBridge DAO to retroactively reward participants proportionally to how they have helped out the protocol in the early stages\n\n**Is there a fee model for participants?**\n\nThe protocol takes a 10bps fee from every transaction (5bps go to validators and their delegators that help to secure the protocol, and another 5 bps go to deBridge treasury)\n\nLink to analytics dashboard of protocol: https://explorer.debridge.finance/\n\nDune dashboard: https://dune.com/mak5577/DeBridge\n\nBridge and cross-chain swaps for users: https://app.debridge.finance/\n\nTechnical documentation: https://docs.debridge.finance/\n\nAt this stage cross-chain swaps are routed through the intermediary deUSDC pool at Curve which sets the maximal amount of swap being limited by liquidity in the pool (https://docs.debridge.finance/deswap/cross-chain-swaps-liquidity). The credit line provided by Portals will solve this problem by enabling new routings and more capital-efficient cross-chain swaps with larger transactions, limited only by the amount of the credit line.\nOne of the unique features of deBridge is the cross-chain \"transactions bundling\" where an arbitrary set of actions can be packed into one cross-chain interaction, e.g. users can do a cross-chain swap and supply the resulting liquidity to AAVE. \nThe liquidity from Portals will be used in various scenarios:\n1) Facilitate liquidity inflow into AAVE v3 on different chains so users can supply liquidity using any arbitrary asset on any chain supported by deBridge.\n2) Let anyone automatically transfer positions across instances of AAVE v3 on different chains.\n3) Utilized for routing of cross-chain swaps performed by users/protocols through deSwap.\n4) Any applications and projects that integrate the [deSwap API](https://debridge.finance/api) which will use Portals’ liquidity bringing additional monetization to the AAVE protocol.\n\nWe have prepared for the Aave community an application POC for swap + deposit into AAVE in a single transaction: https://stake-aave.debridge.finance/stake-aave\n\nOnce the deSwap widget is integrated into the AAVE application, all users of the AAVE UI will utilize liquidity of Portals to perform above-mentioned interactions with the protocol. This is an example of ETH liquidity routing on Ethereum which is converted into AVAX and supplied to AAVE on Avalanche:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5cNShm5.png)\n\n\nOnce integrated with Portals, its credit line will be used instead of deUSDC.\n\n## Technical implementation\nIntegration with Portals is to be performed through a dedicated deAaveAdapter smart contract that will be developed by the deBridge team and audited by our security partner Halborn. This smart contract utilizes the deBridge generic messaging protocol and interacts with Portals (AAVE Pools). \n\nIt receives liquidity from the user, then redeems the loan on one chain and takes the same amount of credit to another chain. Whenever users or protocols perform a cross-chain swap, the following set of actions is performed by the smart contract:\n1. Accept liquidity from the sender on chain A (e.g. Arbitrum) and check if there is any unbacked amount to be repaid\n2. Pay the outstanding amount and lock the remaining liquidity in the deAaveAdapter\n3. Send a message to the deAaveAdapter on chain B (e.g. Polygon) through deBridge. The message contains a command to take a loan, redeem aToken and transfer liquidity to the receiver\n\nOnce the transaction initiated on Chain A is final and irreversible, the deBridge infrastructure will execute the transaction on the destination Chain B in the following sequence:\n1. Execution of the passed message in the external call to deAaveAdapter\n2. deAaveAdapter will mint the needed amount of aTokens by calling mintUnbacked function of Portals\n3. deAaveAdapter will redeem received aTokens and transfer the resulting tokens to the receiver by calling withdraw method of AAVE protocol\n\nThis design of deAaveAdapter guarantees that the liquidity lent from Portals on one chain is always backed by the same amount of asset locked in deAaveAdapter on another chain. By this design, liquidity that was lent to deSwap always remains in AAVE’s possession as any user/protocol can bridge assets from the chain with an outstanding loan to unlock the corresponding amount of the same asset locked in the deAaveAdapter on another chain. \nThis diagram shows the general flow of a cross-chain interaction when deSwap will be integrated with Portals:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QoCmmH9.png)\n\n## Proposed list Credit Line request\nThe credit lines to be allocated to deBridge are requested for each blockchain where AAVE v3 is deployed. deBridge is currently deployed on 6 blockchains and one of the reasons we haven’t deployed on others has been the lack of liquidity for deSwap. Portal is solving this problem and deBridge will prioritize integration to have the list of supported blockchains matching those where Portals are deployed.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Llsbqfn.png)\n\nThe maximal amount of the cross-chain swap that can be performed by users and protocols in one transaction is capped by the amount of approved credit line. deBridge will pay a 2bps fee on all the liquidity taken from the Portals\n \n#### Incentives\nAn incentive program may be approved by the deBridge DAO after the deBridge token goes live.\n\n### Audits & Security\nList of relevant security audits of the network\nSecurity has always been our main priority. deBridge has passed four independent security audits by reputable companies such as \n- Halborn \n- Zokyo\n- Ackee Blockchain\n- Neodyme \n\nAll security audit reports can be found on our [Github](https://github.com/debridge-finance/debridge-security).\n\ndeBridge has a long-term partnership with [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) that audits not only smart contracts but all the modules created for the protocol. \nWe also have an ongoing bug bounty program on Immunefi:\nhttps://immunefi.com/bounty/debridge/\n\nWe have done extensive research and seen that many bridges are missing various security measures like basic balance sheet validation and nonce sequence validation. These crucial components among others have been implemented in deBridge. More details about our cross-chain security strategies can be found here:\nhttps://blog.debridge.finance/10-strategies-for-cross-chain-security-8ed5f5879946\n\n#### Has the Entity experienced outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks? on which Networks?\nNever\n\n## VOTING\n### FOR:\nDO Approve Credit Lines for deBridge\n\n### AGAINST:\nDO NOT Approve Credit Lines for deBridge\n",

        "body": "## Proposal\nWormhole is a leading cross-chain interoperability protocol, allowing generic messaging over 22 heterogenous blockchains 1 and soon to be many more.\n\nSince launch on mainnet in August 2021, 160 million messages have been transmitted with 2 million messages 1 currently generated a day between asset transfers and messaging. The sheer load of messages that Wormhole processes in a 24 hour period is comparable to an L1 and signals its high reliability.\n\nWormhole has nineteen guardians comprised of the leading PoS validators 1 who jointly attest to messages. Each guardian holds equal weight in governance and consensus. Wormhole requires over two-thirds of the 19 guardians to gain consensus and pass verification, thus we assume that at least one-third of our guardian set is trustworthy.\n\nHashflow is a decentralized exchange platform designed for interoperability, zero slippage, and MEV-protected trades. Hashflow works by connecting professional market makers directly to traders using a request-for-quote (RFQ) model.\n\nHashflow uses DeFi-native RFQs to fetch quotes from market makers who are responsible for managing liquidity in the pools. Market makers are required to cryptographically sign quotes that remain unchanged for the duration of the trade. This ensures that the price is guaranteed and cannot be front-run or sandwich attacked. It also protects traders against slippage if there is significant price movement between the time it takes to validate the transaction on the source chain and relay the payload on to the destination chain.\n\nHashflow leverages Wormhole’s generalized message-passing to communicate between source and destination chains.\n\nWe propose a custom protocol utilizing Wormhole’s generic messaging for cross-chain communication and Hashflow’s cross-chain DEX to facilitate collateral transfers when backing aTokens (detailed below). Generic messaging unlocks Wormhole as a neutral interoperability layer on which protocols can serve users across most chains today. Wormhole has been integrated with Hashflow, which leverages a request-for-quote (RFQ) model for efficient liquidity provision, depth, and order execution quality. Users request a quote to sell some amount of asset X on the source chain and buy some amount of asset Y on the target chain without incurring slippage on the quoted price. Institutional market makers compete on price and depth for order execution and provide a signed quote to the user, which the user includes as calldata when sending the trade transaction on the source chain. With over $11.75B in lifetime trading volume and aggregate average daily volume of $25M from traders directly using the platform and through the aggregators 1inch Network, Open Ocean, Odos, and Zerion, Hashflow has been battle-tested and is a logical starting choice for these cross-chain collateral transfers. Users pay no trading fees for this cross-chain swap but are responsible for the associated gas fees when bridging their aTokens and might incur an implicit fee in any price-differences between the collateral asset on the source and destination chain. Additionally, Wormhole currently does not charge any fees for token bridging.\n\nPending Aave V3 deployments on the specific L1s/L2s, the protocol can support Aave on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and BNB. To start, we suggest piloting Portals on Arbitrum as a burgeoning deployment and ecosystem.\n\n## Integration\nA custom protocol (”Protocol”) utilizing Wormhole and Hashflow for a Portals integration could function as follows for a given source and target chain:\n\nUser uses the Protocol front-end built on Wormhole to transfer aTokens to the Protocol contract.\n\nProtocol front-end will fetch a signed quote from Hashflow which will be used as a payload to perform the cross-chain swap\nProtocol front-end will allow the user to review the quote before confirming the transaction\nUser’s aTokens are then escrowed in the Protocol on the source chain.\nFollowing the transfer of aTokens, the source chain Protocol contract calls the withdraw function in the Aave Pool contract on the source chain, which transfers the user’s previously escrowed aTokens from the Protocol contract to the Aave Pool contract and then transfers the user’s underlying collateral from the Aave Pool contract to the Protocol contract.\n\nThe contract then submits the signed quote to Hashflow’s cross-chain router to swap the user’s source-chain native collateral to the target-chain native collateral, sending this collateral to the target chain Protocol contract.\n\nNext, the target chain Protocol contract calls mintUnbacked 2 function in the target chain Aave Pool contract followed by the backUnbacked function to atomically mint aTokens to the user on the target chain and back these aTokens.\n\nTo prevent the collateral risk to the Protocol on the source chain and to allow for seamless atomic liquidations on the target chain, we suggest that Aave prevent users from bridging aTokens used as collateral on the source chain and prevent the use of the unbacked aTokens as collateral on the target chain until they’ve been backed by the bridge.\n\n## Technical Specifications\nIs the entity a Bridge?\n\nWhile users can bridge assets using applications built atop Wormhole, Wormhole is primarily a generic interoperability protocol, enabling users and developers alike to use and build complex, composable applications on top of Wormhole.\nCan anyone provide liquidity to the protocol?\n\nN/A\nIs liquidity incentivized?\n\nNo, at this time liquidity is not incentivized.\nIs there a fee model for participants?\n\nThere are currently no fees when participants use Wormhole.\nDoes the entity plan to provide available liquidity into Aave protocol?\n\nTBD\nLink to analytics dashboard of protocol (Liquidity, assets, networks, volume).\n\nhttps://wormhole.com/stats/ 1\nhttps://wormhole.com/explorer/ 1\nhttps://app.hashflow.com/dashboard\nIf applicable, link to the user-focused dapp of the entity.\n\nhttps://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer\nhttps://wormhole.com/ecosystem/\nhttps://app.hashflow.com/ 1\nLink to technical documentation\n\nhttps://book.wormhole.com/\nhttps://docs.hashflow.com/hashflow/product/bridgeless-cross-chain-swaps\nProposed Portals Asset Minting Caps\nOn all networks that Aave V3 is deployed on and Wormhole supports, we propose conservative Portals minting caps of $0.5M, $1M, and 50 ETH respectively for USDC, USDT, and ETH to begin with but aim to increase this over time subject to governance. The protocol will charge users a nominal 3bps fee to bridge over their aTokens, of which the Aave DAO will be entitled to 50%.\n\nScreenshot 2023-02-22 at 3.27.46 PM\nScreenshot 2023-02-22 at 3.27.46 PM\n1436×168 6.53 KB\nBenefits to AaveDAO\nAave is at an inflection point, with a sizable but closing head-start on its multi-chain deployment and usage. With the launch of V3 on Ethereum, it is timely to pilot Portals, enabling seamless flows of capital from the liquidity hub of Ethereum to the other V3 deployments. For AaveDao’s longterm success, it’s imperative that the DAO fosters these multi-chain deployments while still in the lead as the tight integration of aToken assets into DeFi creates a strong moat. Additionally, with tens to hundreds of millions of TVL and volume in Hashflow and Wormhole, we see Portals as an natural way to onboard Hashflow and Wormhole users into the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Audits & Security\nList of relevant security audits of the Wormhole network\n\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Ethereum Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Solana Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Terra Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Guardian\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Solitaire\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Ethereum Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Solana Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Terra Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Guardian\nAugust 2022 - Kudelski: Algorand Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - OtterSec: NEAR Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - Trail of Bits: Solana Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - Trail of Bits: CosmWasm Contracts\nUnderway audits can be found here\nList of relevant security audits of Hashflow\n\nOctober 2022 - Quantstamp\nOctober 2022 - Certik\nNovember 2022 - OpenZeppelin\nSecurity Properties\n\nThe Wormhole dependency in the implementation above is in the core messaging layer, relying on the standard trust assumption of the PoA consensus with 19 guardians where more than two-thirds are required to reach consensus and verify a message. These guardians are made up of some of the largest and most reputable staking providers in crypto. This level of operational security diversity is a useful property in preventing wholesale compromise of the Guardian Set due to operational failures of a single or small number of organizations. More information on Wormhole security practices can be found here.\n\nHashflow relies on Market Makers for providing quotes, and Wormhole for ensuring that the cross-chain messages are correctly passed. The former is a transparent process (the user can see these quotes ahead of execution), whereas the latter falls back on Wormhole’s security properties.\n\nThe logic of creating new unbacked aTokens on the target chain, withdrawing collateral on behalf of the user on the source chain, and backing users’ unbacked aTokens on the target chain lies in the Aave protocol, falling back on Aave’s security.\n\nHas the Entity experienced outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks? On which Networks?\n\nWe recognize that Wormhole has earned some press for the hack in February of this year. Since then, Wormhole continues to add multiple security layers 1 to help prevent/mitigate the effects of smart contract bugs like the one responsible for that hack:\nThe first of these, Governor, allows each Guardian to set limits on the notional value of any transfer originating on a supported chain within a specified time period. The Governor allows Wormhole Guardians to provide optional value movement protections to token bridges built on Wormhole. This protection allows Wormhole Guardians to govern (or effectively rate-limit) the notional flow of assets from any given token bridge chain. This safety feature allows Guardians to limit the impact of any security issue any given chain may have from affecting other connected chains. The Governor allows the setting of daily limits of notional flow and also has an ability to set a fixed finality delay for transactions over a specific size for each supported chain.\n\nFurther layers of security to prevent incorrect withdrawals of funds is the Cosmos-based Wormhole Chain, which enables Guardians to independently verify if the source chain has sufficient funds to do cross-chain transfers, and an emergency shutdown module, allowing a quorum of Guardians to temporarily pause value movement through Wormhole.\n\nAdditionally, Wormhole has a $2.5M bounty program on Immunefi.",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to whitelist Connext, a trust minimized cross chain protocol, for V3 Portals on 6 chains: Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony - with credit lines for USDC ($2m on each chain), USDT ($1m on each chain) and ETH (40 ETH on each chain).\n\n## Reasonale\n\n[Connext](https://connext.network) is a network for **fast, trustless communication between chains and rollups**. It is the only interoperability system of its type that does this cheaply and quickly without introducing any new trust assumptions. Connext is aimed at developers who are looking to build bridges and other natively **cross-chain applications**.\nTo date, over $1.3b in transactions have crossed the network.\n\nOur network of liquidity providers only works with native assets, or the most canonical representation of a wrapped asset.\n\nWith our [Amarok upgrade](https://blog.connext.network/announcing-the-amarok-network-upgrade-5046317860a4), a series of improvements are coming for users, developers and liquidity providers (routers): the latest will be tasked with providing capital upfront to the users, while getting refunded within 30 minutes when the slower confirmation, coming from the [Optimistic communication protocol Nomad](https://blog.connext.network/optimistic-bridges-fb800dc7b0e0), is completed.\n\nUsers’ transactions get confirmed in seconds, LPs get rewarded with a fee on the transaction for their service.\n\n**Portals are therefore a perfect match for Connext as our LPs will need and want to access immediate extra liquidity to fulfill transactions, and our new architecture allows for this operation to be completed via the protocol in a trust minimized way**.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\nConnext is much more than a bridge, it’s an **interoperability protocol**: it allows to build cross chain applications without adding trust assumptions.\nOne of these applications are bridges, others could be cross chain NFTs marketplaces or cross chain governance portals.\n\n**51 routers are currently providing $40m+ of liquidity.**\nThe highly capital efficient architecture of Connext allows for higher volume (and therefore higher returns) with less capital compared to other solutions in the space.\nThe system is currently working on a whitelist basis.

        "body": "Vote:\nYES = In-favour of listing BTC.b on the Avalanche V3 Market\nNO = Against listing BTC.b on the Avalanche V3 Market\n\n## References\n\nProject: https://www.avax.network/\nDocument portal: https://docs.avax.network 1\nContract addresses: Bitcoin (BTC.b) Token Tracker | SnowTrace 3\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/avalancheavax?s=20&t=PSU83btgvaI0pwbkwO8vCA 1\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @avalancheavax\nTechnical Documentation: Bridging Bitcoin To Avalanche: A Technical Overview | by Michael Kaplan | Avalanche | Jun, 2022 | Medium\nSupport Documentation: Avalanche Bridge | Avalanche Support\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to list BTC.b as a collateral asset. BTC.b is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community, introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology. The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and off-ramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi. It is a seamless, easy and secure process.\n\n## Driving Factors\n\nSecure: the bridge must be audited and built with security-first technologies.\nCost-Effective: the cost of bridging assets should be low.\nFast: the transaction should take the least amount of time possible.\nTransparent: users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process.\nIntuitive: users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge.\nSpecifications\n\n### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\nThe author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team.\n\n### Provide a high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nAva Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain. Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups. Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages.\n\nBTC.b is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is non-custodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest on/off ramps to the Bitcoin network.\n\n### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral?\n\nBTC.b is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest, easiest and safest way to get BTC on-chain. As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTC.b allows another avenue to get BTC on-chain.\n\nBTC.b is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, Pangolin, Benqi, and Paraswap.\n\n### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nAvalanche’s primary network consisting of its X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain went live a little over a year ago with on-chain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime. C-Chain is an EVM-compatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages.\n\nThe Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi, peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum. Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush, Avalanche’s liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021, attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users. Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away.\n\n### How is the asset currently used?\n\nCurrently, there is about $28M worth of BTC.b bridged to Avalanche C-Chain. Some of the top protocols with BTC.b integrated include $30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance, the Avalanche native stableswap, $2.6M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol, and $14M of liquidity for the AVAX-BTC.b pair within the AMM Trader Joe.\n\n### Emission schedule\nNo emission schedule\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nThe bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8. The wardens include Ankr, Blockdaemon, Chainstack, Protofire, Avascan, Ava Labs, Bware Labs, and Halborn. BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet. This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet.\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $28M\n24 Hr Volume: $501k\nExchanges: Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, and Pangolin\nCoinGecko: Bitcoin Avalanche Bridged (BTC.b) Price in USD: BTC.B Live Price Chart & News | CoinGecko 1\nSocial channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\nTwitter: 715k followers (https://twitter.com/avalancheavax)\nTelegram: 48k member (Telegram: Contact @avalancheavax)\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of deployment: June 21, 2022\nThe number of transactions: 14,440\nThe number of holders: 408\n\n### How It Works/Technical Specifications\n\nThe Bridge can be broken down into two main parts: the SGX application and a set of third-party indexers and verifiers called “Wardens.” The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing. The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network. For security reasons, neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users. Instead, they’ll explicitly whitelist each other’s IP addresses for direct communication. In addition, all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature. For relaying information to the Bridge user base, each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings, assets requirements, and attestation report. The front end is set to disable itself if there’s any discrepancy within the critical information.\n\n### Proposed Technical Parameters\n\nBTC.b is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV, a 75 percent liquidation threshold, and a 6.5 percent liquidation penalty. With the level of on-chain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTC.b back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins, these parameters are safe.",

It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.\n\njFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.\n\nThe protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.\n\nWe have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).\n\nCombined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).\n\nWe also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.\n\njEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.\n\nWe debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.\n\nThe protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:\n\n- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).\n- $78M of volume on our primary market.\n- 33k swaps by 9k users.\n- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).\n- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).\n- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.\n- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.\n\n# Benefits for Aave V3\n### Fiat on and off-ramp\njEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.\n\nWe have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).\n\nHaving jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.\n\n### Large addressable market\nA part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).\n\n### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins\njEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.\n\n### DDM\njEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.\n\n### Low risk collateral\nAs collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.\n\njEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.\n\njEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.\n\n\n# Risk Parameters\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:\n\n1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.\n\n# Security specification and risks\n\n### Risks inherent to jEUR\nBesides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.\n\njEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.\n\n\n[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)\n\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.\njEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.\n\nThere is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.\n\nIt does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.\n\n### Audits\nWe have had two different audits by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and [Ubik](https://ubikgroup.co/): [Read the audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/security)\n\n# Data\n\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap: €3.5M circulating ($4M)\n- 24h Volume: $2M on our primary market, $400k on secondary markets\n- Volatility: Low\n- Maturity: Early\n\n### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n- Discord: 3k members\n- Twitter: 16.1k followers\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: Sep 2021 (Polygon)\n- Number of Transactions: 116k transactions including 30k swaps on our primary market and 22k on secondary markets.\n- Number of holders for token: 3,242 (more holders possible due to farming programs)\n\n# Links\n- Website: [https://jarvis.network](https://jarvis.network)\n- Dune: [Jarvis Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/0xroll/JarvisNetwork)\n- Docs: [https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network)\n- Code: [https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network)\n\n# Voting options\n- YES, add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n- NO, do not add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n",
