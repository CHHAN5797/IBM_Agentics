One of the distinguishing characteristics of [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is that stakers control their keys. Those who work on the protocol strive for the following:\n\n1. Decentralization is the primary objective. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will never compromise on the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the protocol. Stakers must maintain control of their ETH.\n2. The [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) protocol is a real business with a sustainable revenue model.\n3. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will do the right thing for the Ethereum community, always. If and when the team messes up, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) will own it and course correct quickly.\n\neBTC is Ether.fi’s flagship Bitcoin-backed liquid restaking token. Created to service the growing demands of alternate collateral within restaking, eBTC simplifies yield optimization and expands utility. eBTC is backed by LBTC, through a partnership with [Lombard](https://docs.lombard.finance/), to bring the first dual yield (staking + restaking) Bitcoin product to market. Staking will be conducted through Babylon, with restaking serviced through a combination of Eigen Layer, Symbiotic, and Karak. Users are able to deposit LBTC, WBTC & CBBTC.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\neBTC is an LRT that allows users to restake their BTC, accrue staking rewards, and receive additional rewards through restaking on EigenLayer, Symbiotic and Karak. As of Dec 13th, approximately **2,175,000** ETH ($8.5B) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) protocol with 6500 BTC ($650M) dedicated to the eBTC LRT. You can view additional [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) stats on [Dune](https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi).\n\nUsers are given eBTC on a 1:1 basis with their chosen BTC deposit asset. As mentioned above, [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer, Symbiotic, and Karak — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi](http://ether.fi) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity for eBTC to various platforms.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Currently, the protocol utilizes a DAO and a governance token model to push large initiatives and objectives.    \n\n2. **Oracles:** The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the internal & external committee members. Specific to eBTC, exchange rate oracles which also monitor the reserves have been built by eOracle.\n\n3. **Audits:** Audit reports for the[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol are found on the GitBook page -[ Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n\n5. **Centralization vectors:** The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle which is run by a multi-party committee. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also tied into the functionality of the protocol oracle. Specific to eBTC, there are additional timelocks added which are required to update the exchange rate from the standard 1:1 ratio.\n\n6. **Market History:** Market history and protocol information can be found here on the[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) Dune dashboard -[ https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi](https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi)\n \n7. **Value:** The eBTC-WBTC pool on Balancer is intended to serve as one of the primary liquidity sources for the token on Ethereum. The pairing of eBTC with WBTC will maintain critical liquidity sourcing for a smooth trading experience, while yielding added rewards for the liquidity providers.\n\n##### Contracts\n\neBTC on Ethereum: `0x657e8C867D8B37dCC18fA4Caead9C45EB088C642`\n\neBTC/WBTC Base pool on Balancer: [Liquidity Pool (v2): Balancer eBTC/WBTC](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0xda17f3663c5d04c0b316cfa1a04aa53ebbc8c12c0000000000000000000006e7)\n\n##### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`\nwill interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x5d0aa3b7f4429e999c95d392e6c50c6555cd7816`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "PR with Payload:\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1456\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a wstETH-weETHs pool on Ethereum, with no emissions cap. This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\nReferences/Useful links:\n\n• Website - https://www.ether.fi/\n\n• Documentation - [ether.fi Whitepaper | ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper)\n\n• Github Page - [etherfi-protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol)\n\n• Discord - [ether.fi](https://discord.com/invite/zqGzcuQWvD)\n\n• Twitter - https://twitter.com/ether_fi\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is a decentralised, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols weETHs is a liquid restaking token, serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain and restaked on Symbiotic. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint weETHs, hold weETHs to accrue rewards, and use weETHs within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permissionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) liquidity pool into weETHs accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards and will also be natively restaked with Symbiotic. Staking with weETHs on[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) automatically restakes that ETH to Symbiotic and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their weETHs in other DeFi protocols. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, weETHs acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n[ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is looking to seed a wstETH-weETHs pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for weETHs on Ethereum. Incentivizing a Balancer pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Ethereum. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. Governance: - Currently, the protocol utilizes a DAO and a governance token model to push large initiatives and objectives.\n\n2. Oracles: - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the internal & external committee members.\n\n3. Audits: - Audit reports for the[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol are found on the GitBook page -[ Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n4. Centralization vectors: - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle which is run by a multi-party committee. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also tied into the functionality of the protocol oracle.\n5. Market History: - weETHs has been deployed and functional since June '24. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the[ ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) Dune dashboard -[ https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi ](https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi)\n6. Value: - The wstETH-weETHs pool on Balancer is intended to serve as one of the primary liquidity sources for the token on Ethereum. The pairing of wstETH with weETHs will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.\n\nweETHs on Ethereum: 0x917cee801a67f933f2e6b33fc0cd1ed2d5909d88\n\nwstETH/weETHs Base pool on Balancer:[ Balancer 2 ](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x2ab8df7429f4fce60eb2c1233f0326767765e2f30000000000000000000006da)\n\n**Specification**\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x0Bb8B971AaF99eddfddE2e71736eBEBe8CC7769b`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/823\n\n**Summary**\nThe ether.fi team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-rETH pool on Arbitrum, with a 10% emissions cap. This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n```\n• Website - https://www.ether.fi/\n• Documentation - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper\n• Github Page - https://github.com/etherfi-protocol\n• Discord - https://discord.com/invite/zqGzcuQWvD\n• Twitter - https://twitter.com/ether_fi\n```\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the ether.fi liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on ether.fi automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. \n\nThe eETH contract has been live since June 2023, with eETH launching to the open market on November 15th, 2023, and has approx. 515k ETH held within it. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nether.fi is looking to seed a weETH/rETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for weETH on Arbitrum. Incentivising a Balancer pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Arbitrum. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the L2 DeFi ecosystem. \n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed ether.fi executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token.\n\n2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the ether.fi team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however as the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee.\n\n* The exchange rate feed for weETH-ETH on Arbitrum has been deployed by Chainlink. \n\n3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the ether.fi protocol are found on the GitBook page - [Audits - ether.fi](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits). The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at ether.fi, however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the ether.fi DAO and governance.\n\n5. **Market History:** - eETH was first deployed November 15, 2023. Market history and protocol information can be found here on the ether.fi Dune dashboard - https://dune.com/ether_fi/etherfi\n\n6. **Value:** - The weETH/rETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum. The pairing of eETH with rETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers.\n\nweETH on Arbitrum: 0x35751007a407ca6FEFfE80b3cB397736D2cf4dbe\n\nweETH/rETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x4b3af34eb1135d59df8b9cdc2ff07d30d05334c400000000000000000000050d\n\nChild chain gauge [0x8C206459a557aA736F698401BD6029fC0Db3f3c8](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8C206459a557aA736F698401BD6029fC0Db3f3c8#code) — mainnet root: [0xB5dCdE9aDCace88705658Aa276C557afC011FE55]\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xB5dCdE9aDCace88705658Aa276C557afC011FE55`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "title": "[BIP-507] Enable weETH/rETH Gauge w/ 10% Cap [Ethereum]",
        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/683\n\n**Summary:**\nThe [ether.fi](https://www.ether.fi/) team proposes a Balancer Boosted Gauge for a weETH-rETH pool on Ethereum mainnet, with a 10% emissions cap. The goal is to move from the current weETH-WETH pool to this one over time because of the 100% yield bearing nature in the new pairing. The proposal below is based on the original proposal of [BIP-492](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-492-enable-weeth-weth-gauge-ethereum/5353).\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Currently when users wish to restake their LST’s they lock their tokens, which breaks composability in DeFi. Staking with eETH on [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. No other liquid staking protocol has this capability.\n\nThe eETH contract has been live since June 2023 and has approx. 10,000 ETH held within in - this ETH was accumulated before eETH was officially launched and available for end users to hold directly. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned to the price of ETH.\n\nThrough these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with the added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n[Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is looking to seed a weETH/rETH pool on balancer to serve as a primary source of liquidity for eETH. Incentivising a Balancer pool could significantly boost the liquidity of the LRT. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the DeFi ecosystem. To ensure success, [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is committed to enhancing the value of the veBAL ecosystem by promoting pool liquidity through Hidden Hand voting incentives\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** - Currently, the protocol utilises a multi signature wallet, with the signatories being doxxed [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) executives. This will change with the evolution of the protocol, moving to decentralized governance with a DAO and a governance token in approx. 3-6 months.\n2. **Oracles:** - The Protocol relies on an oracle for withdrawals and beacon state, however, the reliance on an oracle for beacon state is set to go away in an upcoming Ethereum upgrade. The Oracle is based on the hash consensus mechanism and run by the committee members. Initially, the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) team will be the only ones to operate the Oracle nodes, however the protocol grows, it will add more external parties to join the committee. \n- The rate provder for weETH is the same contract as the token and has been reviewed by the integrations team. It was deemed SAFE [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/WeETH.md). \n3. **Audits:** - Audit reports for the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) protocol are found on the GitBook page - https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/security/audits. The audits have been carried out by reputable firms such as Certik, Zellic, Nethermind, Omniscia and Solidified to ensure the security of the protocol. An audit competition was also recently completed through Hats Finance.\n4. **Centralization vectors:** - The centralization vectors primarily relate to the Oracle until it becomes decentralized, in line with the protocol roadmap. The price (staking rewards for rebasing) and the validator management (spinning up new validators and exiting them for liquidation) are also currently centralized for the early stages of the protocol to ensure mobility. As mentioned above, the signatories currently consist of the doxxed executive team at [Ether.fi](http://ether.fi/), however this will be upgraded with the implementation of the [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) DAO and governance.\n5. **Market History:** eETH is a brand new Liquid restaking token, therefore there is not much in the way of market history as Balancer will serve as the first pool to support wrapped eETH.\nweETH/rETH pool on Balancer: [0x05ff47AFADa98a98982113758878F9A8B9FddA0a](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x05ff47afada98a98982113758878f9a8b9fdda0a000000000000000000000645)\nGauge: [0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF)\n6. **Value:** - The weETH/rETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token. The pairing of eETH with rETH will maintain the originally intended smooth trading experience, while yielding more rewards for the liquidity providers. \n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xC859BF9d7B8C557bBd229565124c2C09269F3aEF`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
