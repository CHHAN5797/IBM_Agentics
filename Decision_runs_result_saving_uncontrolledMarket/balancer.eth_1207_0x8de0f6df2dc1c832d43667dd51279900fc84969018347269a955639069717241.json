Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to enhance Balancer's presence at key live events in the Crypto and DeFi space as part of our marketing strategy for the launch of Balancer v3. Attending these events will help us improve brand visibility, establish thought leadership, showcase technological innovations, foster valuable networking opportunities, and deepen community engagement.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Motivation\n\nIn-person events are crucial for building and maintaining valuable relationships within the crypto community. They provide unique opportunities to present our latest developments, engage with thought leaders, and gather insights directly from our user base and potential partners. Specifically, the launch of Balancer v3 requires heightened visibility and strategic engagement to amplify its reach and aid adoption. Attending these events will provide Balancer with unparalleled opportunities to promote v3, build strategic partnerships, and engage with our community. This is a cost-effective approach to maximize our marketing efforts and ensure the successful launch of Balancer v3.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Goals and Objectives\n\nTo maximize our impact at live events, we have narrowed our focus to four key areas:\n\n### Brand Visibility and Thought Leadership\n\n- **Objective:** Enhance Balancer's brand presence and position the protocol as a thought leader in DeFi.\n- **Actions:** Engage in key speaking opportunities, contribute to panel discussions on future trends, and share insights on DeFi's evolution. (CEO, CTO)\n\n### Showcase Technological Innovation\n\n- **Objective:** Demonstrate the capabilities, benefits, and new features of Balancer v3.\n- **Actions:** Host workshops, curate hackathons, participate in panels, and coordinate events with key partners. (Blabs, Maxis)\n\n### Networking and Partnerships\n\n- **Objective:** Establish and strengthen relationships with developers, potential partners, and other influential players in the crypto industry.\n- **Actions:** Attend networking events, host side events and social meet-ups to foster relationships with key prospects. (Maxis, Marketing)\n\n### Community Engagement\n\n- **Objective:** Deepen engagement with the crypto community and gather valuable insights.\n- **Actions:** Host meet-ups, participate in social events, leverage social media and branded merchandise for engagement and giveaways. (Marketing)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Specification\n\n### Event Participation Plan\n\nWe propose to attend the following key events:\n\n- **ETHCC (July 8 - 11):**\nETHCC presents an opportunity for us to sow the seeds of connection for community and partnership goals. Rather than focusing on speaking at the main event, our goal is to organize social events and invest energy in grassroots networking. This event will also help us identify areas for improvement for future events.\n- **Token2049 (September) and Devcon (November):**\nFor these events, we will focus on establishing thought leadership by participating in key speaking opportunities and organizing a panel event with key partners to heighten awareness around v3 and its technology. Additionally, we will organize social events to complement the main activities. The goal is to align our impact with the launch of v3 and have ample time to prepare speakers and official events.\n\n### Key Activities\n\n- **ETHCC:ETHCC:**\n    - **Host a Side Event with Key Guests:**\n        - We will organize a side event featuring both prominent guests building on Balancer such as Gyro, CowSwap, and Quant, as well as notable partners such as Aave, Lido, Rocket Pool, Karpatkey. This gathering will provide a unique platform to bring together influential figures and key partners within the Balancer ecosystem.\n    - **Activities:**\n        - **Networking:** Facilitate informal networking sessions to help attendees connect with industry leaders and peers. This will provide opportunities for meaningful discussions and potential collaborations.\n        - **Social Events:** Organize social activities that encourage relaxed and personal interactions, allowing participants to build stronger, more personal connections.\n        - Merchandise: Enhance our presence and create lasting impressions with branded merchandise that capture the essence of the Balancer brand.\n- **Token2049 and Devcon:**\n    - **Key Contributors and Panel Discussions:**\n        - **Arrange for Key Contributors to Speak:** We will ensure that influential voices from Balancer, participate in speaking opportunities. Their insights and expertise will highlight Balancer v3's innovations and impact on the DeFi space.\n        - **Host Panel Discussions with Key Partners:** Collaborate with leading projects like Gyro, CowSwap, and Quant to organize panel discussions around protocols building on Balancer. These panels will focus on the advancements of Balancer v3 and its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem, providing a platform for thought leadership and in-depth discussions.\n    - **Hackathons:**\n        - **Participate in Hackathons:** Potentially engage in hackathons during Token2049 and Devcon to demonstrate Balancer v3's technical prowess and encourage innovative uses of our platform. Our team will be available to support participants, answer questions, and provide guidance on integrating Balancer’s technology.\n        - **Host a Balancer-Sponsored Hackathon:** Organize a Balancer-specific hackathon challenge to incentivize developers to build on top of Balancer v3. Winners can receive rewards and recognition, promoting creativity and highlighting the versatility of our platform.\n    - **Additional Social Events:**\n        - **Engage with the Wider Community:** Host informal social events, such as meet-and-greets, dinners, and networking mixers, to foster personal connections and engage with the DeFi community. These gatherings will provide a relaxed environment for meaningful interactions and relationship-building.\n        \n    ---\n    \n### 5. Implementation\n\n### Rough Timeline\n\n- **May - June:** Finalize event plans, secure speakers, and coordinate logistics.\n- **July:** Attend ETHCC, host side event.\n- **August - September:** Prepare for Token2049, develop presentation materials, and confirm participation.\n- **September:** Attend Token2049, and engage in speaking opportunities and panels.\n- **October - November:** Prepare for Devcon, and finalize hackathon details.\n- **November:** Attend Devcon, and participate in hackathons and panels.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Budget Considerations\n\nBelow is a rough budget for participation at ETHCC:\n\n| Category | Item | Cost per Unit (EUR) | Quantity | Total Cost (EUR) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tickets | Event Ticket (standard price) | 750 | 10 | 7,500 |\n| Travel | Flights/Trains (per person) | 1,000 | 10 | 10,000 |\n| Accommodation | Hotel (3-4 star, 5 nights) | 1250 | 10 | 12,500 |\n| Promo and Merch | Branded Merchandise | 5000 | 1 | 5,000 |\n| Social Events | Hosting Side Events | 10,000 | 1 | 10,000 |\n| Miscellaneous | Per Diem | 75 | 10 | 750 |\n| Total | Estimated Total | - | - | 45,750 |\n\n**Note:** The subsequent events would follow a similar budget structure, with potential adjustments based on our experiences at EthCC.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Specific Ask for Funding**\n\nWe are requesting funding from the Balancer DAO to cover the costs associated with attending these key events. The estimated total budget for ETHCC is 45,750 EUR, and we anticipate similar costs for Token2049 and Devcon, adjusted for any improvements based on our ETHCC experience. This funding will cover accommodations, event tickets, per diem costs, transportation, promotional materials, expenses related to hosting social events, and hackathon participation.\n\nOpCo will manage all payments and spending related to these events, ensuring efficient use of funds. The required budget will be sourced from the unallocated grants held by OpCo, ensuring that the expenditure aligns with our overall financial planning and support for the Balancer community.\n\nAdditionally, any unspent funds from these allocations will be rolled over to future events or initiatives, ensuring continued support and financial prudence in our promotional activities.\n\nBy securing this funding, we aim to maximize our impact at these events, promoting Balancer v3, fostering new partnerships, and enhancing our engagement with the DeFi community.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Success, Reporting, and Improvement\n\n### Reporting\n\nAfter each event, we will provide a detailed report to the Balancer DAO that includes:\n\n- Summary of activities and participation.\n- Key outcomes and metrics.\n- Photos and videos from the events.\n- Financial report detailing the actual expenses.\n\n### Continuous Improvement\n\nBased on the feedback and experiences from each event, we will:\n\n- Identify areas for improvement for future events.\n- Adjust our strategy and activities to maximize impact.\n- Share best practices and lessons learned with the community.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Conclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to secure funding for Balancer's strategic participation in key live events. By enhancing our presence at these events, we aim to significantly contribute to the successful launch of Balancer v3 and strengthen our position in the DeFi.\n\n**Specification**:\n\nNo technical specification required as funding will be supported by OpCo in this scenario; not interacting with the DAO Multisig directly.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1071\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Beethoven X DAO\n\n **Leader(s):** Jedi, Naly, Vee\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** \n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):**\n\n### Introduction & Domains of Operation\n\n---\n\nOver the past six months, the Beethoven X Marketing SP has strived to play an impactful role in supporting the Balancer DAO's mission to be recognized as a leader in AMM innovation.\n\nOur efforts have been multifaceted, focusing on producing high-quality educational content, strengthening community engagement through social media, collaborating with key partners, and refining brand development and visual creativity. We have also supported core growth strategies and laid the groundwork for the successful launch of Balancer v3 in Q4 this year.\n\nAs we near the completion and release of the v3 codebase to the public, Balancer v3 offers a golden opportunity to redefine our position as a driving force in AMM innovation. Inspired by much of what was expressed in Fernando's recent [vision post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801), we remain highly optimistic about Balancer's future and are fully committed to supporting the ecosystem to the best of our abilities.\n\nAs the current funding period under [BIP-519](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-519-funding-proposal-for-the-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-sp-jan-jun-24/5406) draws to a close, this proposal seeks an extension of funding for the continuation of marketing services from July 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\nThe following sections will discuss some of the key initiatives behind our efforts over the past six months as well as highlight future goals for the next half.\n\n### Key Initiatives & Success Metrics\n\n---\n\n### Education & Content\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\nDriving awareness of Balancer’s core value propositions is the cornerstone of our content creation strategy. As such, we have continued to focus on educational content to enhance the understanding and adoption of Balancer’s core product market fit (PMFs).\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. **Yield Bearing Hub**\n    - With innovations in Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), yield-bearing stablecoins, and Liquid Restaked Tokens (LRTs), Balancer's technology has been crucial in optimizing liquidity for yield-bearing assets. We have focused on developing articles and educational resources to illustrate the benefits of Balancer’s technology in this area.\n\n**Key Content:**\n\nYield Bearing Asset Thesis:\n\nhttps://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-the-yield-bearing-asset-thesis-f44489ba2deb\n\nBalancer showcasing it’s PMF with the Liquid Re-staking Narrative: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749779120450601256\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1759582409526521859\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1760673085131518220\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1768623354532253908\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1780991371966607684\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1788705818814394807\n\nBrought the first Yield Bearing SOL asset to the Ethereum Ecosystem: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785028800797175858\n\nShowcasing innovative solutions for staked stablecoins:\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1786391170194821623\n\n2. **8020**\n\n- The 8020 initiative continues to drive significant value for the Balancer ecosystem. We have continued to develop educational resources to demonstrate the benefits of this model as well as collaborated closely with various projects to co-market and highlight their success stories.\n\n**Key Content:**\n\nve8020 notion pack for partners:\n[The ve8020 Initiative](https://www.notion.so/The-ve8020-Initiative-f13e066945d44d95846d9eb8163180c9?pvs=21) \n\nContinued the ve8020 narrative on X:\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749001706430718356\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749930025384853982\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1767500752740835777\n\n3. **Building on Balancer**\n\n- Balancer distinguishes itself as a platform enabling true AMM experimentation and innovation. We have strived to bring awareness to this by showcasing Balancer’s unique product-market fit (PMF) and highlighting the various AMMs built on Balancer by external teams\n\n**Key content:**\n\nExplaining the cold start problem: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1790455748016668699\n\nShowcasing custom AMM adoption across DeFi: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1798414505325871318\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1801322082698961038\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1784942600925196680\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1796228354850570732\n\nBreaking down new custom pools: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785747336049930252\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785748797340979451\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1793264880226640373\n\n### Partnerships & Strategy\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nBalancer’s long-term success is intrinsically linked to the success of the protocols and products built on our platform. As such we have strived to build stronger relationships with key partners to amplify our ecosystem's reach, enhance Balancer’s product offerings, and drive collaboration.\n\n**Focus:**\nBy closely collaborating with partners to co-develop marketing campaigns, curate educational content, and ideate on community initiatives we have actively strengthened existing foundations and forged new connections within our broader ecosystem.\n\n**Case Studies:**\n\n1. **Gyroscope:**\n    - The integration of Gyroscope’s E-CLP invariant into Balancer’s platform has been a significant milestone. This collaboration has facilitated over $1.1 billion in volume, demonstrating enhanced capital efficiency and validating Gyroscope’s innovative AMM model within Balancer’s ecosystem. Gyroscope has been a testament to the power of Balancer’s infrastructure, setting a solid foundation for other projects to follow.\n    \n    https://x.com/Balancer/status/1795891066626789774\n\n1. **Aura:**\n    - Aura plays a crucial role in the Balancer ecosystem by aggregating and boosting yield for liquidity providers who stake their BPTs. Building a stronger relationship with Aura's marketing team has been a priority over recent months, especially after the disbandment of Orb. Our collaborative marketing efforts with Aura aim to significantly strengthen our users understanding of the broader Balancer x Aura ecosystem, drive community engagement, and showcase the synergistic potential of working together in DeFi.\n    \n    https://blog.aura.finance/what-is-balancer\n2. **CowSwap:**\n    - CowSwap plays a crucial role in the evolution of AMMs by focusing on minimizing MEV and optimizing trade execution. Collaborating with CowSwap is an essential strategy for Balancer, with the potential to propel Balancer to the forefront of AMM innovation with a successful new product. Over the past few months, we have worked closely with the CowSwap team to create educational material regarding LVR (Loss Versus Rebalancing) mitigation strategies for AMMs as well as to develop a Go-To-Market campaign for the upcoming launch of CoW AMM on Balancer.\n    \n    https://x.com/Balancer/status/1793264880226640373\n\n### Design\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\nTo enhance the Balancer brand by creating a cohesive and visually compelling identity that resonates with our target audience, supports our strategic goals, and reinforces Balancer’s position as a leader in DeFi innovation.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. **Brand Development:**\n    - With v3 almost ready for release, we have worked closely with Pon to help evolve the Balancer visual identity for the upcoming  UI release and Z3N rebrand. This collaboration includes the development of a comprehensive brand style guide and asset library to be used across various content verticals, supporting contributors and partners, and ensuring a cohesive and impactful visual presence for Balancer's upcoming initiatives.\n    \n2. **v3 Landing Page:**\n    - As part of the upcoming launch for v3, we have assisted with curating and developing content for the v3 landing page. This effort ensures the page effectively communicates Balancer's core value propositions and embodies Balancer's distinctive style.\n    \n3. **Visual Content Creation:**\n    - Alongside the v3 launch, we have consistently supported marketing-related content with visual imagery. This effort complements the broader marketing strategy and helps to explain content in a more visually engaging way.\n\n \n![image.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicoowhteavye2iknmgmzad3q2nre64dmmi7vrcryj7xbxzmkcxhqy)\n    \n\n\n### v3\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nAs we finalize and prepare to release the v3 codebase, the launch of Balancer v3 presents a prime opportunity to reassert our leadership in AMM innovation. Our primary objective is to present Balancer v3 in the most favorable light, offering thorough education on its key features, executing a comprehensive marketing campaign, and ensuring alignment with business development, design, and strategic partnerships.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. v**3 strategy** \n- Our primary objective has been to ensure that all key elements behind Balancer v3 are aligned for maximum effectiveness. This includes defining [Balancer’s value proposition](https://www.notion.so/bfca24480c4f4470ac70b1d5ebba9fff?pvs=21) for developers building custom AMMs, creating a framework for developer onboarding, and prioritizing critical focus areas. Key initiatives included crafting a compelling landing page with marketing and Pon, developing an informative pitch deck with Lipman, and formulating custom AMM liquidity strategies by Mike B and Tritium. By synchronizing these efforts, we aim to showcase Balancer v3’s unique strengths and drive its successful launch and adoption.\n\n![plan.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicmbobqirvldd5k277huy4btcsgkyp7ksvdyxy5xlnn4pxl6gpwre)\n    \n1. **Go-to-Market (G2M) Strategy:**\n- Our Go-to-Market (G2M) strategy for the v3 launch has been coordinated to build anticipation and ensure a smooth rollout. This includes a phased approach beginning with the release of Fernando's vision article and the codebase reveal, followed by the unveiling of the new UI and Zen rebrand. The strategy will leverage deep dive articles, press releases, partnerships, and teaser campaigns to maximize engagement. We will work closely with key partners like Gyroscope, CowSwap, and Aura to help amplify our efforts. Additionally, our design team is working to ensure all visual elements are cohesive and compelling, further highlighting Balancer v3’s innovative features. This G2M plan aims to effectively showcase Balancer v3's features and foster a successful market entry.\n1. **Content Creation:**\n    - Our content creation strategy for Balancer v3 is focused on developing a series of comprehensive educational materials that will guide users and developers through the new capabilities of v3. This includes a range of articles, tutorials, and explainer videos designed to provide in-depth understanding and practical insights into Balancer v3’s functionalities.  By leveraging a mix of written and visual content, we strive to make the learning process engaging and accessible for all users, with the aim to drive adoption and engagement for Balancer v3.\n    \n2. **Key Partnerships:**\n    - Collaborating with strategic partners is essential to promoting Balancer v3. We are working closely with projects like Aura, CowSwap, and Gyroscope to ensure seamless integration and co-develop promotional strategies that highlight the synergies between our technologies. Looking ahead, we also plan to collaborate on future projects like QuantAMM and host events such as AMAs to showcase the advantages of v3 and its integration with partner technologies.\n\n### Future Goals\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nTo continue driving innovation and growth within the Balancer ecosystem through strategic educational initiatives, creative design projects, strengthened partnerships, in-depth content creation, and live events.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n**1. Balancer University:**\n\nWe aim to establish a comprehensive educational resource designed to guide new users from a basic understanding to an advanced grasp of Balancer technology. Balancer University will cover a range of topics, including beginner's guides to AMMs, the power of 8020s, Boosted Pools, E-CLPs, and a detailed guide on entering the Balancer ecosystem. Additionally, we will develop and deliver tutorials covering various aspects of Balancer, from basic functionalities to advanced custom AMM strategies, ensuring users are well-equipped to navigate and leverage the platform's full potential.\n\n**2. Creative Design Initiatives:**\n\nOur goal is to produce high-quality visuals and infographics that explain complex concepts and highlight the key features of Balancer v3. These visuals will focus on areas such as the AMM design space on Balancer, the broader Balancer ecosystem, hooks, CoW AMM, and comparisons of AMM development on Balancer versus other platforms. \n\n**3. Partnership Focus for v3:**\n\nBuilding and strengthening strategic partnerships is crucial for mutual growth. We plan to forge new relationships and reinforce existing ones with projects like Gyroscope, CowSwap, QuantAMM and Aura. These collaborations will include joint marketing campaigns, co-branded events, and collaborative product development. \n\n**4. Deep Dive Articles:**\n\nWe will publish a series of in-depth articles that explore the technical and economic aspects of Balancer v3. These articles will highlight real-world use cases, success stories, and innovative applications built on Balancer. By providing thought leadership content on the future of DeFi, liquidity provision, and AMM advancements, we aim to position Balancer as a leading voice in the industry.\n\n**5. Community Engagement:**\n\nFostering a vibrant and engaged community is essential for our continued success. We plan to achieve this through interactive initiatives and continuous engagement. We have begun to seed a culture based around the Balancer Buffalos and plan to expand on this foundation in the near future. \n\n**6. Live Events:**\nParticipating in industry conferences and events is a key strategy for showcasing Balancer’s innovations and expanding our reach. These events improve brand visibility, establish thought leadership, and offer unique opportunities for networking and community engagement. For the launch of Balancer v3, attending live events will demonstrate our new features, build strategic partnerships, and deepen community connections through workshops, hackathons, and social meet-ups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n---\n\nAs we approach the completion and release of Balancer v3, we are poised for a transformative period that will redefine our position in AMM innovation. While v3 is on the horizon and will receive significant focus, we remain dedicated to the ongoing development and progression of v2. Our marketing efforts will continue to coordinate closely with the Maxis, BD, and Design teams to ensure comprehensive coverage and support for all initiatives, ensuring Balancer’s continued success across both platforms. \n\n### Length of Engagement & Budget\n\n---\n\nWe are requesting an extension of the current funding outlined in BIP-519, amounting to $30K USDC per month, for marketing-related services from July 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\nThe requested funds will exclusively cover contributor salaries. Our team consists of 2 full-time contributors, Jedi and Naly, who manage marketing strategy, content curation, and social media. Additionally, part-time contributions are provided by Vee (brand development and design) and Josey (social science studies and related content).\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

        "title": "[BIP-697] BD Service Provider Proposal for Q4 2024 to Q1 2025",
        "author": "0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17",
        "body": "PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1356\n\n# Introduction\n\nOver the last 9 months, the BD Service Provider (BDSP) has gone from a brand new entity in Q1 to an integral part of Balancer. The BDSP, in partnership with the Maxis and other contributors to Balancer, has helped drive partnerships, liquidity, relationships, and opportunities for Balancer throughout the EVM ecosystem. Numerous partners have commented how they prefer to work with Balancer over other DEXs because of the support they receive from the BDSP and Maxis, and Balancer receives countless inbound requests from prospective partners because of existing partners spreading this via word-of-mouth.\n\nGiven the BDSP has become an integral part of Balancer’s growth strategy, we aim to switch to bi-annual funding starting in Q4 2024. This provides us with more funding stability and also guarantees that resources for the upcoming Balancer v3 launch will be adequately allocated.\n\n# Priorities and Initiatives\n\nThe BDSP will focus on the following priorities and specific initiatives during 4Q24 and 1Q25. For background, the BDSP has shown a consistent track record executing against the proposed initiatives during Q1-Q3. For Q3 performance reports please see [July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bdsp-july-update/5914) and [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bdsp-august-update/5990) reports.\n\n## Initiative 1: Foster growth of the Balancer v2 protocol\n\n**Summary**\n\nWhile every SP plays an important role in generating new opportunities for Balancer, the BDSP’s primary responsibility is finding ways to generate opportunities for Balancer. One of the primary focuses of the BDSP will be continuing to find areas of growth and executing on them.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Execute liquidity strategy on Balancer v2**\n    - Prioritize yield-bearing assets (LSTs, LRTs, ibStables) or primary strategic assets to generate revenue for Balancer\n    - Find opportunities to deploy new pools on key strategic chains, which includes new pools of Balancer ecosystem projects (e.g. Gyroscope, CowAMM)\n    - Make sure Balancer stays on top of new metas (e.g. BTC LRTs, Veda vaults, etc.)\n    - Retain key strategic liquidity in existing pools\n    - Make sure governance requirements are completed to secure liquidity from partners, where necessary (e.g. AAVE, Frax)\n\n2. **Solicit new partnerships**\n    - Be proactive by finding new prospective partners, reaching out, and engaging in discussions\n    - Be the primary point of contact for inbound partnership inquiries\n    - Facilitate internal discussions for partner evaluation\n\n3. **Grant and incentive programs**\n    - Find grant/incentive programs applicable to Balancer\n    - Apply for these programs\n    - Execute the program, where necessary\n\n4. **Execute veMODE program on Mode**\n    - Launch innovative, ecosystem-wide veMODE program, which leverages a MODE 8020 pool to direct $OP and $MODE rewards to protocols on Mode, in partnership with Mode and Aragon\n    - Work with members of Maxis to coordinate incentive programs and partner incentive management\n    - Collaborate with partners on Mode and the Mode team to generate new pools and acquire liquidity on Mode.\n\n## Initiative 2: Support the launch of Balancer v3 and facilitate growth and adoption.\n\n**Summary**\n\nAlong with the Maxis, the BDSP will play a meaningful role in establishing relationships and partnerships both pre and post v3’s launch.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Plan and execute on v3 launch**\n    - Work with BLabs and Maxis to finalize rollout plan\n    - Educate new and existing partners on v3 and how they can leverage for new opportunities\n    - Drive v3 liquidity with partners across chains\n    - Support Marketing and BLabs to drive developer engagement and new products\n\n2. **Support deployments on strategic chains**\n    - Work together with the Maxis on chain deployments\n    - Coordinate expansion plans with ecosystem partners\n\n3. **Collaborate with Maxis to advance Balancer tokenomics and the DAOs revenue strategy**\n4. **Continue supporting engineering with aggregator integrations and other technical partnership needs (as necessary)**\n    - Example: working with BLabs to ensure all aggregators are engaged and the partnership between Balancer/BLabs and aggregators is being supported.\n\n## Initiative 3: Partner Support\n\n**Summary**\n\nAs mentioned above, one of Balancer’s strategic advantages - in addition to its technology - is the level of care and support it provides partners. The ‘white glove’ service Balancer offers is exhibited from SPs across the DAO, but the BDSP will continue playing its role as mentioned below.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Onboard new partners into the Balancer ecosystem**\n    - Help advise on pool type strategy and incentive strategy\n    - Guide through governance / Aura processes and timelines\n    - Help facilitate rate provider review needs and drive to completion in timely fashion\n    - Help facilitate partners’ Points information being included on the Balancer UI (where applicable)\n\n2. **Work closely with Marketing to support co-promotion of new and existing partners**\n3. **Be the primary point of contact, along with members of Maxis, for partners’ non-technical needs. Be responsive and helpful at all times.**\n4. **Continue seeking ways to eliminate friction for partner onboarding**\n    - Example: collaborate with Maxis and Chainlink to utilize CCIP to expedite rate provider deployments\n\n## **Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Business Development Service Provider\n\n**Contributors:** Lipman\n\nPledge to abide by [[BIP-629]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-629-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards: Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* Partner Management\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n1. **Strategy and Business Development**\n    - Develop and execute liquidity strategies for Balancer v2, focusing on yield-bearing and strategic assets (LSTs, LRTs, ibStables).\n    - Identify and deploy new pools on key strategic chains to drive ecosystem growth (e.g., Gyroscope, CowAMM).\n    - Stay ahead of market trends and metas (e.g., BTC LRTs, Veda vaults) to ensure Balancer's competitive positioning.\n    - Lead efforts to attract new partnerships by engaging with potential collaborators and evaluating partnership opportunities.\n    - Execute governance processes to secure liquidity and incentives from key partners (e.g., AAVE, Frax).\n    - Launch and manage innovative incentive programs like the veMODE initiative, in collaboration with Mode and Aragon.\n    - Collaborate with BLabs and Maxis on the successful rollout of Balancer v3, driving partner liquidity and product adoption.\n\n2. **Partner Support**\n    - Provide ‘white glove’ support to new and existing partners, guiding them through pool creation, governance, and incentive strategies.\n    - Serve as the primary point of contact for partners, ensuring prompt and effective responses to their needs.\n    - Assist partners in navigating Balancer’s ecosystem, including advising on pool types, rate providers, and governance timelines.\n    - Work closely with marketing teams to co-promote new and existing partnerships across the ecosystem.\n    - Streamline partner onboarding by identifying and eliminating friction points, such as collaborating with Chainlink to utilize CCIP for faster rate provider deployments.\n    - Continuously engage with partners to optimize revenue generation and liquidity retention strategies, ensuring long-term success for both parties.\n\n**Reporting**\n\nThe BDSP has provided weekly updates in the DAO-wide Ballers meeting on Mondays, a separate weekly update with the Maxis and Marketing teams on Thursdays, and monthly reports posted to the forum. The BDSP will update the ecosystem and community participants regularly through weekly meetings and monthly community reports:\n\n**Weekly Ecosystem Meeting**\n    - Inform ecosystem participants of our weekly progress and planned activities\n    - Coordinate collaborations and issues with other ecosystem stakeholders\n\n**Monthly reports**\n    - Write up detailed monthly reports on key objectives\n    - Provide a financial statement of the usage of discretionary funds as in previous funding rounds\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nThe BDSP spent $2k of its Q3 $6k discretionary budget for a part-time contributor during August/September who will not be contributing going forward. The $4k of savings are being requested to roll over to Q424/Q125 at the team's discretion for non-people costs and/or part-time contributors.\n\nThe BDSP has 1 FTE and will be reducing its proposed cost from the [Q3 BDSP funding proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-635-business-development-sp-proposal-for-q3-2024/5798) to $14k/mo in Q4-Q1 vs. $15k/mo in Q3 as well as not asking for any additional discretionary budget. This amount is inclusive of both USDC and vesting BAL amounts.\n\nThe combination of the reduced monthly cost and reduced discretionary budget will result in a $9k savings per quarter for the DAO.\n\nA detailed breakdown of proposed costs is visualized below:\n\n![image|659x500, 75%](upload://xOGL4BZX0DBhoRD5LUIm2Mav4w8.png)\n\n\nLength of engagement: 6 months\n\nBudget: 72,000 USDC and 6,780 BAL\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a\n\nImpact on the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold 3,507,473 BAL. Funding the BDSP for the next half year would impact 0.19% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 0.38% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 5.727mln in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 1.25% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 2.5%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer passing the BDSP Safe 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a as recipient and amount 72000 USDC as 72000000000.\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with BAL 0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D by writing transfer passing the BDSP Safe 0xC7E84373FC63A17B5B22EBaF86219141B630cD7a as recipient and amount 6780 as 6780000000000000000000.",

Recognized as key contributors and the vital link between partners and the protocol, our dedication to the DAO is unwavering. As we embark on another quarter, our commitment is not just to continue, but to evolve – to redefine our engagement and amplify our positive impact on the DAO in 2024.\n\nThe third quarter marked a significant transition for the Maxis. Following the departure of our strategic visionary, Solarcurve, we embraced change and innovation. Tritium rose to the occasion, leading critical initiatives like the [core pool incentive automation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-457-core-pool-incentive-program-automation/5254), as well as securing and executing on the Arbitrum STIP, demonstrating our adaptability and resilience.\n\nOur evolution goes beyond roles and responsibilities. The Maxis are transforming from a collective of passionate enthusiasts to a team of full-time, professional experts. The new full-time addition consists of @Xeonus who will spearhead our strategic direction.\n\nOur mindful approach to funding allocation ensures an efficient use of resources – balancing USDC and BAL demands with maximum effectiveness. Our focus is not just on growth but on impact and transparency.\n\nIn 2024 we want to make the most impact by driving forward exciting initiatives while providing excellent mission-critical services to the DAO. We have identified four main (non-v3 dependent) initiatives to channel our efforts, while continuing to provide the core services that have been the backbone of the DAO for over two years.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nBeyond regular operations, the Maxi’s are focused on trying to create successful narratives in the Balancer ecosystem through various focused initiatives. In 2024, we strive to focus on a few of them, ensure that our focus areas have a clear leader/champion and some defined goals and that time and resources are available to focus on these topics. The impact of those topics is directly related to the achieved objectives.\n\n### Initiative 1: Growth beyond Mainnet\n\nLead: Tritium\n\nTeam: Shakotan (tech and operations), Xenous (data)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Grants Committee, Beethoven (Marketing + Beets grants)\n\nSummary\n\nThe initiative aims to further strengthen the DAO's presence beyond mainnet, focusing on Arbitrum, zkEVM, and Gnosis. The initiative emphasizes the successful execution of the Arbitrum STIP, but most of all development of strong competencies in creating data-driven narrative showcasing Balancer’s competitiveness, and collaboration with key blockchain partners such as Polygon and Aribtrum. The strategy includes adaptability to pivot based on market trends and performance metrics and an ever growing understanding of the KPIs that our grant providing partners care about.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Timely STIP Execution: Ensure punctual and successful delivery of the current STIP, including consistent reporting and active engagement with the DAO.\n2. Data Narrative Development: Work to build a competency within Balancer to tell stories about how we are using our emissions to drive growth for our protocol and in the ecosystems we exist in.\n\n  1. We should be able to put out velodrome style reports that tell our story.\n\n3. KPI-Focused Program Management: Stay close to various grant programs and look at successful grant recipients to understand the KPIs they set and how they achieve them.\n\n  1. Propose changes at Balancer to make this possible or point out why we are not well suited to meet the kinds of KPIs that chain ecosystems see value in.\n\n4. Next Grant Cycle Preparation: Identify potential grant sources for the upcoming cycle and strategize engagement.\n5. Feedback Integration: Actively seek and incorporate feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the initiative.\n6. STIP Comparative Analysis: Collaborate with the STIP body to assess and report on Balancer's performance in comparison to peers.\n7. Impact Report Creation: Develop a comprehensive report detailing the impact of extra incentives delivered through balancer on L2 ecosystems.\n8. Strategic Partnerships: Strengthen collaborations with Gnosis Chain, Base, Arbitrum and Polygon to share successes and apply learnings, particularly in the context of zkEVM scaling.\n9. Collaborate with Beets as much as possible to create a shared competency here.\n\n### Initiative 2: Redesign of the Gauge Framework v1\n\nLead: Xeonus\n\nTeam: Shakotan (building automation), Tritium, Zekraken, Zen Dragon and Mike B (design)\n\nSummary\n\nThis initiative aims to introduce an automated, dynamic system for evaluating and adjusting gauge emissions based on performance metrics. This new framework is designed to efficiently allocate BAL rewards, optimizing support for both high-cap and emerging projects. The goal is to ensure a more responsive and adaptable system that balances revenue optimization with nurturing potential future revenue generators.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Automated Gauge Evaluation: Develop a system for automatic assessment of gauges based on predefined metrics.\n2. Dynamic Emission Cap Adjustments: Implement a mechanism to adjust emission caps (ranging from 2% to 10%) based on gauge performance, potentially reducing underperforming gauges to a certain cap (e.g. 0.5%).\n3.

Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q1 2024 would cost around 0.9% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.3M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.5% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~10%.\n\nFurthermore, this table provides an overview of the last years impact putting this proposal into perspective:\n\n|Year|Quarter|BAL|BAL Price|USDC|ETH|ETH price|Operations cost|People cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|2023|Q1|48000|$6|$0.00|0|1201|0|$266,400|$266,400.00|\n|2023|Q2|42150|$7|$0.00|5|1795|8975|$291,257|$300,231.50|\n|2023|Q3|26025|$5|$132,630.00|20|1853|37060|$251,825|$288,884.50|\n|2023|Q4|31695|$3|$168,770.00|20|1652|33040|$271,779|$304,819|\n|2024|Q1|35718|$4|$108,095.00|20|2170|43400|$250,969|$294,369|\n\nAlthough the Maxis will have around 1 FTE more manpower at their disposal, the impact on the treasury stays nearly the same. Maxis have undergone internal optimizations in pay to reduce the impact on the DAOs USDC as much as possible given the current market conditions. In that regard, 49.5% of requested funding will be locked in our stkauraBAL vesting contract. We will also roll over $37,720.00 in savings from our Q3 and Q4 budget (bizdev, bounties etc.) and deduct that amount from the current proposal, which further reduced our overall demand for USDC.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\nLink to SLA (if going through the Foundation): N/A\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `108095` USDC as `108095000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `35718` as `35718000000000000000000`\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with WETH `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` by writing `deposit` with amount `20` to wrap the required ETH.

        "body": "https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/702\n\n**Introduction & Domains of Operation:**\n\nOver the past nine months, The Beethoven X DAO has strived to play a pivotal role in strengthening Balancer's presence and influence within DeFi.\n\nOur journey commenced in April 2023 when we assumed the role of a dedicated Service Provider, initially focusing on technical support as outlined in[ BIP-254](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-254-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao/4652).\n\nIn response to the evolving landscape and the departure of Orb Co, The Beethoven X DAO transitioned to bolster Balancer's marketing efforts, originally undertaken by Orb Co.This strategic shift prompted modifications to BIP-254, expanding its scope to include marketing responsibilities.\n\nThe subsequent introduction of [BIP-314](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810) clearly defined the nuanced parameters for the services provided by the Beethoven X DAO, distinctly categorising them into technical and marketing domains.\n\nThe implementation of [BIP-394](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-394-fund-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-for-aug-dec/4973) marked the adoption of a more refined marketing strategy, aiming to build upon the foundation laid over the preceding three months. From August 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, a concentrated effort has been made to amplify Balancer's presence across social media, highlight various growth pillars central to Balancer's Product-Market-Fit (PMF), continued brand development, and the development of long-term initiatives, aiming for a robust and enduring impact for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, with the imminent launch of Balancer V3, substantial efforts have been directed towards planning a successful Go-to-Market (G2M) campaign and ensuring an impactful release at the beginning of Q2 24’.\n\nAs the current funding period under BIP-394 draws to a close, this proposal seeks an extension of funding exclusively for the continuation of marketing services from January 1, 2024, to June 30, 2024.\n\nThe subsequent sections will delve into the key objectives and success metrics guiding our past endeavours as well as highlight future goals.\n\n---\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics**\n\nOver the last 5 months, our primary objective in marketing has been to position the Balancer ecosystem as a leading force at the forefront of DeFi innovation. Our strategic focus involves the creation of high-quality educational content on core technology, the cultivation of a robust community, and the amalgamation of a captivating visual identity with an approachable brand voice to reinforce the Balancer vision.\n\nOur approach revolves around a synergistic relationship between users and diverse content forms to sustain and amplify engagement. For an in-depth exploration of our philosophy and marketing strategy, please refer to the following [post.\n](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-balancer-marketing-analysis/4705/14)\nTo achieve this goal we have focused our energy on the following areas:\n\n* Social Media\n* Core Growth Pillars\n\nBelow we have outlined the intention for these initiatives with relevant KPIs for their measurement/success.\n\n**Social Media:** Social Media (X), plays a pivotal role in Balancer's branding and outreach strategy. As the primary platform for showcasing Balancer's content, Twitter serves as a critical avenue for communicating our brand narrative, educating users on our key products and maintaining a direct line of connection with our audience.\n\nOur social media growth strategy for Balancer encompasses several pivotal elements. We prioritize the creation of consistent content aligned with Balancer's core growth pillars, emphasizing simplicity and educational value. We actively cultivate partnerships to broaden our network impact, refining our visual identity and voice for a cohesive brand representation. Additionally, our engagement extends to community initiatives (AMAs etc.), fostering increased participation and interaction within the Balancer community.\n\n**Content:** Content serves as the linchpin for our entire communication strategy, permeating most aspects of our brand marketing and establishing the overarching tone for the ecosystem. As such a major focus is to deliver high-quality content to our users in a clear and easily digestible manner. Ranginng from individual tweets, to more detailed threads and educational articles we have curated a wide variety of content to dynamically showcase the nuances to both the Balancer ecosystem and its technology.\n\nFor an updated library of Balancer content plese see the following [link.](https://balancer.notion.site/ca695d5e71904d7291d43698f98615d1?v=d4f41a042f0c424ba99f5b9aab17700b&pvs=4)\n\n**Community Contributors:** In addition to core content the contributions from the community contributors have continued to drive significant value for the Balancer ecosystem with weekly Balancer Reports, Gauge Updates, and the staked ETH animations.\n\nFor a list of all community contributor content please see the following content [library.](https://balancer.notion.site/538e20956a59419da640569b5a14a258?v=b4ca723fff314372a7cbac39b8980450&pvs=4)\n\n**KPIs / Data Analysis**\n\n \n![BIP-519.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifqo55laradyf6tdurabet433tust5iojyu3doavav7wpuem64tvu)\n    \n\n*The overall number of followers has increased by 8.7%, for a cumulative total of 1151.86K. The number of impressions has increased by 78%, totalling 6,402,075. Tweet engagement also saw an increase of 106% with a total of 72,128, while the total number of profile clicks was up 99.5% with 21,038.*\n\n**Overview:** From April 01, 2023, to Dec 04, 2023, Balancer has seen significant progress in key social media metrics, reflecting positive impacts on the brand's online presence and engagement.\n\n**Social Media Growth:** The total followers increased by 8.7%, reaching 1151.86K, showcasing consistent community expansion. Impressions increased by 78% to 6,402,075, indicating a broader reach and increased visibility on X (Twitter).\n\n**Engagement Metrics:** Tweet engagement increased by 106% to 72,128, highlighting heightened audience interaction. Profile clicks rose by 99.5% to 21,038, signalling a growing interest in exploring the Balancer profile and the brand.\n\n**General Trend:** A consistent positive trend in Balancer's social media performance is evident, with collective growth in followers, impressions, and engagement metrics. This suggests an expanding and more engaged audience, affirming the effectiveness of SP-led marketing efforts in elevating Balancer's visibility in the DeFi landscape.\n\n**Outliers:** During August and September, two notable exploits impacted the Balancer protocol, causing a spike in activity. This reflected hyper inflated reactions related to the exploits.\n\n**Conclusion:** The cumulative increase in followers, impressions, and engagement metrics underscores the success of our marketing goals during the SP role. This positive trajectory affirms that implemented strategies have effectively contributed to Balancer's growth and engagement on social media platforms, solidifying its relevance in the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n**Core Growth Pillars**\n\nIn collaboration with the BD team, it was apparent early on that targeting marketing efforts towards the most important areas defining Balancer's PMF was going to be crucial to long term success. To measure efforts in this regard we have identified key core growth pillars that are critical to the success of Balancer’s ecosystem. These pillars are:\n\n* 8020\n* Liquid staked tokens (LSTs) / Boosted Pools\n* Building on Balancer\n* Ecosystem Growth\n\nTo promote the development of each of these core growth pillars the following strategies have been implemented:\n\n**8020:** We have concentrated our marketing endeavours on showcasing the advantages of the 8020 model. Additionally, we've introduced an 8020 partnership initiative, aiming to highlight successful case studies, collaborate on co-marketing initiatives, and develop an educational resource pack. Our goal has been to provide users with valuable insights into the benefits of the 8020 approach.\n\n* [Qi Dao Case Study](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1716877324594131078?s=20)\n* [ParaSwap Case Study\n](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1691804406004793749?s=20)[Radiant Case Study](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1683854697038516224?s=20)\n* [8020 Initiative Article](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1676954525603860481?s=20)\n* [8020 Partnership Pack](https://balancer.notion.site/The-8020-Initiative-999c0a6e1f774e39b02f26b11c581714?pvs=4)\n* [8020 Dashboard](https://dune.com/balancer/8020-initiative)\n\nThere are currently 20+ protocols that have successfully onboarded into the 8020 with more planned for the near future.\n\n**LSTs / Boosted Pools:** With the growing importance of interest bearing assets, Balancer's cutting-edge technology is instrumental in supporting LSTs. To magnify it’s unique PMF we have focused content to highlights the unique features that distinguish Balancer, emphasising its role in hosting and facilitating the growth of LSTs within DeFi.\n\n* [The Balancer LST Hub](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1676244564598984704?s=20)\n* [ETHx Case Study](https://twitter.com/balancer/status/1681937019373764609?s=61&t=hl_0kBnKZqMUp5x-XYybZg)\n\n**Building on Balancer:** More than a DEX Balancer offers a clear proposition as a programmable base layer for developers. It has become the backbone for numerous successful projects, streamlining development and unlocking innovation. To amplify this capability we have focused on educating users on the numerous benefits Balancer provides.\n\n* [Understanding Balancer Technology](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1673722923717369857?s=20)\n* [Building on Balancer Series](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/built-on-balancer-a-new-defi-series-b898b25b4a93)\n* [BoB Gyroscope Case Study](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1714718036505358556?s=20)\n\n**Ecosystem Growth:** Balancer plays a pivotal role in fostering growth across diverse verticals. Whether it's expanding into new ecosystems, facilitating the liquidity growth of supported protocols, or empowering developers to innovate new primitives, our strategic marketing efforts have centred on spotlighting these invaluable benefits.\n\n* [Ecosystem Launch Pad](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1666822455745462281?s=20)\n* [Base Launch](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1687102165066924035?s=20)\n* [Avax Launch](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1687376484032462848?s=20)\n* [Chainlink Rate Providers](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1692585845834781039?s=20)\n* [Arbitrum LGP](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1707047608404029627?s=20)\n\n---\n\n**Balancer V3**\n\nSince the Milan Onsite in early October, a significant portion of time has been dedicated towards the planning and execution of a larger G2M campaign for the launch of Balancer 3.\n\nTo maintain consistent momentum for the V3 campaign the G2M strategy has been structured into three distinct phases:\n\n**Phase 1:** Unveiling V3 (Nov - 31 Dec)\n**Phase 2:** Pre-Launch (01 Jan - 17 Mar)\n**Phase 3:** Launch (18 Mar - May)\n\nCurrently, we're moving through the end of Phase 1 with the official unveiling of V3 now behind us. Below, we've outlined the key tasks.\n\n**Phase 1:** Over the course of phase 1 our priorities were set on creating the foundations necessary for a successful start to the V3 campaign. This included:\n\n* BD Notion Partner Pack\n* BD Partner Outreach\n* Teaser Campaign\n* Public Announcement and PR\n* Finalise G2M Campaign\n\nHere's a brief summary on each key action items:\n\n**BD Notion Pack**: This involved creating a notion pack that highlights all of the major technical innovations for Balancer V3.\n\n**BD Partner Outreach:** With the Notion Pack complete, the next step was to build rapport and foster synergy with key partners through in-person calls to inform them about V3 and explore collaboration opportunities / co-marketing.\n\n**Teaser Campaign:** With V3 set for a public unveiling at the beginning of Dec, we set about curating content and coordinating with key partners to ensure a successful release.\n\n**Public Announcement and PR:** Aiming to create general awareness about V3 without revealing full technical details, we focused efforts on building hype for the unveil through a launch article. To amplify this launch we co-marketed with key players in the ecosystem.\n\n* [Launch Post](https://twitter.com/balancer/status/1732037889993883688?s=61&t=gzNsdZuJRQwstDGAUw5qNQ)\n\n**Finalising G2M Campaign:** Fine-tuning details for the larger G2M strategy, including ad campaigns, visual direction, roadmaps, partner relationships and press release.\n\n**Phase 2 & 3:** As we embark on the successful first leg of our journey, the road ahead in phases 2 and 3 requires dedicated efforts to maintain the V3 momentum. Our overarching objective is to meticulously showcase the technical innovations of V3 through an in-depth exploration series, establishing robust partnerships for a united launch and fostering collaboration in BD. Additionally, we plan to refine our PR strategy for optimal coverage, launch diverse ad campaigns and community initiatives to generate excitement and enhance engagement. Education will remain a central theme and we plan to release various forms of educational content to make sure all user demographics are fully informed on the benefits and innovations of Balancer V3. To elevate our branding efforts across the board, we're committed to up-skilling our design department, ensuring that we have a competitive edge in our visual identity/branding efforts.\n\nThere's still much to be done, but we're ready to embrace the challenges ahead and we are focused on making sure Balancer is well-positioned for a groundbreaking and successful V3 launch, solidifying its status as a pioneering force in the DeFi.\n\n---\n\n**Notable Events**\n\n**Security Incidents:** Q3 presented challenges for the Balancer ecosystem, marked by two significant security breaches. During this period, our primary marketing focus shifted towards providing ample space and attention to effectively communicate about the linear pool vulnerability / DNS exploit. In an effort to foster trust and transparency, we temporarily adjusted our regular content schedule, prioritising relevant communications on social media channels related to the security incidents.\n\nThese incidents have served as invaluable learning experiences for our marketing team. The challenges posed by the exploits have reinforced the importance of adaptability and responsiveness in our communication strategy. This period of intense focus on addressing vulnerabilities has not only strengthened our crisis management capabilities but has also deepened our commitment to building trust and transparency within the Balancer community. Moving forward, these learnings will fortify our marketing team, ensuring we are well-prepared to handle unexpected challenges and to maintain an unwavering commitment to open communication.\n\n**Supplementary Funding Update:** Over the course of our SP contract, the requested supplementary budget of up to $5000 USDC per month in BIP-394 for external marketing services (animations, design, content, etc.) was established in response to the discontinuation of Coordinape funding. This reserve was intended as a buffer to temporarily augment service output or engage external expertise as needed. However, to date, there has been no necessity to utilise this potential reserve.\n\n---\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nFor the services described above, we are requesting an extension of the current funding outlined in [BIP-394] of $30K USDC / month for marketing-related services for the period of January 1, 2024, until June 30, 2024.\n\nOur marketing efforts consist of 2 FT contributors working at 100% as well as 2/3 PT contributors working at 25-50%. As our team is small, our contributors work across several disciplines; Jedi and Naly (FT) work on the overall marketing strategy, content curation, and social media management. Vee (PT) works on brand development and visual design. Skly (PT) specialises in smart contract development and assists with technically focused articles. Jeff (PT) works on BD and partnership coordination.\n\nAdditionally, outside of the active contributions this month, the Beethoven X DAO has access to several contributors whose expertise ranges from financial accountants, quantitative analysts, and engineers to DeFi social scientists with PhDs that we will tap into as and when needed, all scoped within the above budget.\n\nThese funds will be used solely to cover contributor salaries and as such we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form.\n\nIf approved, $30,000 USDC would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86\n\nMoreover, we propose the continuation of a potential for a supplementary budget of up to $5000 USDC per month dedicated to financing external marketing services (animations, design, content, etc.), to be administered by the Balancer DAO. This allocation would be invoked solely on an as-needed basis, adhering to a maximum cap of $5000 USDC for any given month, with all expenditures meticulously documented in a monthly budget breakdown. The envisaged application of this budget aligns strategically with the significant V3 launch in Q2 2024, offering a valuable resource to maximise the effectiveness of our G2M strategy. In the event we need to cover costs larger than that stipulated in the buffer budget for marketing efforts around the V3 launch, a separate proposal to the Balancer DAO will be made.\n\n---\n\n**Closing Remarks**\n\nIn conclusion, the past nine months have seen The Beethoven X DAO actively contribute to enhancing Balancer's position in the DeFi space. As we navigate these dynamic landscapes, our commitment remains steadfast, and we are poised to overcome future challenges while maintaining an unwavering dedication to transparency, trust, and communication within the Balancer community.\n\nWe are honoured and deeply grateful for the opportunity to play a role in Balancer's success. While we take pride in our accomplishments thus far, we view them as milestones in an ongoing journey of improvement and heightened contribution. Our team maintains a long-term outlook, aspiring to continuously evolve and be the best version in service to Balancer and its community.\n\nAs we anticipate the pivotal launch of V3, our determination and commitment are only strengthened. This significant event marks a crucial moment in Balancer's trajectory, and we are enthusiastic about contributing to its success, further solidifying Balancer's pioneering role in the DeFi space.",
