        "body": "---\n\ntitle: ARC - Strategic Partnership with Balancer Part #2\nstatus: Discussion\nauthor: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham\ncreated: 03-05-2022\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nAcquire 100,000 BAL tokens by deploying a Bonding Curve contract. The BAL tokens are to be held in the Reserve Factor until further details relating to Aura emerges and then the Aave community can determine if to deploy BAL to receive veBAL or auraBAL, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nDeploy a Bonding Curve to acquire an additional 100,000 BAL tokens on market at the chainlink oracle price +50 bps, for a cost $1,708,500 assuming a BAL price of $17. This is an additional purchase to the 200,000 BAL token swap being considered.\n\nAave will become one of eight token holders with 300,000 BAL tokens. All 100,000 BAL tokens are to be retained in the Reserve Factor until such time as further information on auraBAL emerges.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe original motivation for performing a token swap with Balancer can be found on the ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token, [2].\n\nWith the additional 100,000 BAL acquisition, Aave would transition from just outside the Top 50 BAL holder to inside the Top 30 holders, [3]. If an additional 75,000 BAL was acquired, totalling 375,000 BAL, then Aave would become a Top 20 holder and this includes three community wallets, one Polygon bridge pool and the main BAL liquidity pool. So really it would be more like the Top 15 holders if another 75,000 BAL was acquired.\n\nWith 300,000 BAL tokens, Aave would have the largest BAL holding of any strategic partner Balancer has partnered with. The largest strategic partnership holding to date is the 270,000 BAL position held by Tribe DAO, [4,5]. Having a larger BAL holding relative to Tribe DAO may become a competitive advantage as Tribe DAO seeks to direct TVL to Rari Fuse pools with the use of the new ERC-4626 vault, [6].\n\nWith the emergence of ERC-4626, a new type of vault, whereby Liquidity Providers (LP) can deposit their stakes BPT tokens into lending pools and earn BAL rewards whilst using staked BPT as collateral, [7]. This is particularly appealing for staked BPT holdings which have minimal Impermanent loss risk. An example would be to use the staked BPT token for the stable coin Balancer Boosted Pool which uses Aave V2 to generate yield and receives BAL rewards, [8]. Based upon the success of wstETH being listed on Aave V2, this may lead to significant Total Value Locked (TVL) growth for Aave which makes up more than 13% of Aave’s mainnet V2 market TVL, [9].\n\nHaving not yet entered in the Curve / Convex tokenomics play, Aave has an opportunity to be an early leader in the veBAL wars. With the emergence of Aura, the Aave community has a choice to determine if the 100,000 BAL to be acquired are to be deployed for veBAL or auraBAL. If Aura is like Convex, then being early and building an Aura holding is worth considering. The first step in both strategies is to acquire a sizable BAL position and as the initial 200,000 BAL is proposed to be deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year, the 100,000 BAL detailed within this proposal can be deployed into either veBAL or auraBAL contracts.\n\nThere are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using either veBAL or auraBAL to vote for BAL rewards towards pools that create TVL for Aave is a strategic advantage. If Aura evolves like Convex did, then the voter locked AURA token will have more voting influence over BAL rewards than one veBAL token. Being prepared and ready for the Aura token launch is going to position Aave to maximise the upside from its investments as rewards often favour early movers.\n\n# Implementation\n\nA Bonding Curve deployment utilising Chainlink’s BAL/USD oracle feed with a 50 bps incentive for arbitrage trades to acquire BAL on market and deposit into the contract. Aave will provide USDC to fund the Bonding Curve contract. An example of this type of transaction occurred when Tribe purchased $10M of DPI on market, [10].\n\nThe 50 bps fee is to provide an economic incentive for arbitrage traders to attain BAL on market and deposit BAL into the contract profitably by more than offsetting gas costs. This mechanism enables everyone within defi to participate and essentially crowdsources the BAL tokens on Aave’s behalf. Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor.\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer/7617/15\n[3] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[4] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888\n[5] https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x7972e1700ac30495ad936038b66055b1e6420c3de5ed1fec963abe5faa2d16a3\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023\n[7] https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626\n[8] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[9] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&marketName=proto_mainnet\n[10] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The BAL tokens are to be complemented with ETH and deposited into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year. The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nPerform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens. The exchange rate to be used is the 90-day moving average price when the votes pass on both sides. \n\nAll 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer's revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March. \n\nInitially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [2].\n\nWhen the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.\n\nIn addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [3]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.\n\nBy exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange, plus additional acquisition, is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [4]. Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5]. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.\n\nAave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.\n\nThe initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [6].\n\nThe initial sizing was also determined by the ability to influence how the BAL emissions are to be distributed. If all BPT from the BAL : ETH pool are converted to veBAL, Aave will receive 3.3% of the 14,500 BAL emission schedule which is equivalent to 478 BAL weekly, or $8,126/week at $17/BAL or $422,552/year. If 100% of the current BPT were deposited into the veBAL contract, the yield is very close to 10%. Other deployments from the Reserve Factor will also earn BAL rewards over time, [7].\n\nWith 3.3% of veBAL supply, Aave will determine where 2,680 of the 81,200 BAL tokens are to be distributed each week via the Ethereum mainnet pool gauge. This is equivalent to 5% APR on a $47.40M pool without any compounding or other yield sources like swap fees or yield from Aave markets. This is sufficient to support bootstrapping new liquidity pools that support growing TVL for the Aave community. Given the size of the Aave community investment in the Balancer community, it is reasonable to think that Liquidity Mining Committee may also be voting to allocate a portion of there 14,500 weekly BAL emission to support Balancer Boosted Pools which drive TVL to Aave markets.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe token swap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [8].\n\nThe aBAL holding in the Reserve Factor, 1,890 aBAL at the time of writing which will be redeemed for BAL and deployed along with the 200,000 BAL tokens attained via the proposed swap, [9].\n\nOnce the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor from there the BAL and matching amount of ETH will be deployed into the BAL : ETH pool on Balancer V2. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year.\n\nThe veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools\n\n# References:\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512\n[2] https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81/\n[3] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[4] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[5] https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#balances\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-33-swap-between-balancer-dao-and-fei-dao/3555\n[7] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797\n[8] [https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/utils/OtcEscrow.sol](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffei-protocol%2Ffei-protocol-core%2Fblob%2Fdevelop%2Fcontracts%2Futils%2FOtcEscrow.sol&data=04%7C01%7Cmatthew.graham2%40technipfmc.com%7Cfcf199dfb3f64bb3b4ca08da0b1a125b%7C0804c95193a0405d80e4fa87c7551d6a%7C0%7C0%7C637834504350429866%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&sdata=wnFuy5LgP7IJ2G7A4%2B1x%2FBMp1k1bbqw9%2Bk6jkuimd0E%3D&reserved=0)\n[9] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARC] Whitelist Balancer’s Liquidity Mining Claim\nStatus: Proposed\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz  @MatthewGraham\nCreated: 09-09-2022\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal enables Balancer DAO to retrieve the stkAAVE Liquidity Mining incentives distributed to Linear Pools in the Balancer Boosted Aave Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nBalancer DAO seeks to retrieve around 1,500 stkAAVE from several Linear Pools. Balancer DAO accrued this stkAAVE after it deposited liquidity into Aave while Liquidity Mining incentives were being distributed, [1,2].\n\nThe Linear Pool’s contract addresses are not capable of recovering or managing the receipt of stkAAVE tokens. As a result, governance intervention is required to change the contract address which can call and receive the stkAAVE.\n\nThe proposal is to implement the changes required to enable Balancer DAO to retrieve the stkaAAVE from the Linear Pools within the Balancer Boosted Aave Pool.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThree Linear Pools within the Balancer Boosted Aave Pool have accrued around 1,500 stkAAVE from Liquidity Mining rewards, [3].\n\nThe Linear Pools are unable to call `getUnclaimedRewards` with `0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8` from the below contracts:\n\n* 0x02d60b84491589974263d922d9cc7a3152618ef6\n* 0xd093fa4fb80d09bb30817fdcd442d4d02ed3e5de\n* 0xf8fd466f12e236f4c96f7cce6c79eadb819abf58\n\nThe Linear Pool holds the aTokens and receives the stkAAVE liquidity mining rewards but can not call the `claimRewards` function or manage any stkAAVE if it was received.\n\nAave enables other addresses to claim on behalf of smart contracts using the `claimOnBehalfOf` function. In order to do this, a specified address must be declared the valid owner of the contract.\n\n# Specification\n\nSet Balancer contract `0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f` as the claimer in the incentives controller contract, [4].\n\n# Implementation\n\nCall setClaimer() for Balancer contracts on INCENTIVES_CONTROLLER_PROXY_ADDRESS\n\nBalancer DAI-aDAI Linear Pool\n\n> https://etherscan.io/address/0x02d60b84491589974263d922d9cc7a3152618ef6#readProxyContract`\n\nBalancer USDC-aUSDC Linear Pool\n\n> https://etherscan.io/address/0xd093fa4fb80d09bb30817fdcd442d4d02ed3e5de#readProxyContract`\n\nBalancer USDT-aUSDT Linear Pool\n\n> https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8fd466f12e236f4c96f7cce6c79eadb819abf58#readProxyContract\n\nIncentives Controller Proxy:\n>https://etherscan.io/address/0xd784927Ff2f95ba542BfC824c8a8a98F3495f6b5#readProxyContract`\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/boosted-pools#linear-pools\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-continue-liquidity-mining-program-on-aave-v2-ethereum-market-and-introduce-liquidity-mining-on-aave-arc-market/7189\n[3] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[4] https://etherscan.io/address/0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The final proposal will reflect the discussion on the governance forum.\n\ntitle: ARC - Consolidate Aave V1, V2 & AMM Reserve Factors, Purchase CVX and Deploy to Earn Yield\nauthor: Llama Community @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon \ncreated: 03/01/2022\n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThe Aave V1, V2, and AMM market Reserve Factors (RF) on the Ethereum network hold a combined value of over [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). The Llama Community proposes consolidating the RF into the V2 RF and deploying the capital with the intention of retaining TVL and earning additional yield. The yield generated comes with the added benefit of acquiring governance tokens of other DeFi protocols and increasing Aave’s metagovernance influence.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe Llama Community recommends implementing several yield generating strategies spanning Balancer, Curve, and Convex and subsequently participating in the respective communities' tokenomic constructs. Aave will earn yield in the form of swap fee income, aToken yield derived from Aave V2, and governance token incentives in the form of BAL, CRV, CVX, stkAAVE and LDO.\n\nThe first investment theme is deploying capital into the Balancer Boosted Pool and BTC Stable Pool to earn a vAPY of around 13.4% and 4.6% respectively. The Balancer Boosted Pool invests around 80% or more of the deposited liquidity into Aave V2 to earn yield whilst also generating swap fees, stkAAVE, and BAL rewards. The Stable Pool generates income via swap fees and BAL rewards, with the latter making up the majority of the incentives on both strategies.\n\nThe second investment theme is more complex. It involves acquiring both CVX and veCRV to participate in gauge weight voting on Curve in order to influence a portion of the CRV inflation schedules to be distributed to aToken pool Liquidity Providers (LPs). Aave will deploy stables and ETH from the RF to earn additional CRV and CVX rewards, which will be used to further boost the incentive allocation to the aToken pools.\n\nThe data presented here is accurate as of the end of December 2021 data.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Part A - Consolidation\n\nThe legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~[$219M](https://app-v1.aave.com/home) of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time.\n\n![|602x232](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Kqln89Od7cLnxfnd5sEq4gn6xMD2yrAocqa8nJOaXQoyjQ4GlNkgfw8pQ7E2skefYXPdtiqSLwWL_KtYcNiO6Qjciy0I296Q7eiz0R9_NEO1nhZSPJtMqR-eDXg4N7SOqTj-zsEC)\n\nThis proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around ~[$821K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$27.45M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). A summary of the main assets held in the V1 RF are shown below:\n\n![|602x232](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/947026c5031f95dbb5c76d9939f772d746867d90.png)\n\n## Part B - Retain TVL & Increase Returns\n\nWhilst holding aTokens is arguably one of the lowest risk yield opportunities in DeFi and something Llama Community encourages most, if not all, treasuries to hold. The Aave DAO is fortunate since it receives income in the form of aTokens. Thus, Llama recommends firstly making all unproductive stable coins productive and then optimizing further by earning additional yield and metagovernance influence.\n\nThe two main high level strategies proposed in this ARC share three common goals:\n\n* Retain TVL within Aave\n* Exceed aToken returns\n* Accumulate metagovernance influence\n\nIn addition to these three goals, the Convex / Curve strategies have the added benefit of improving the extrinsic use cases for aTokens. aToken holders will be able to deposit liquidity into the Curve aToken pools and then deposit the Liquidity Provider (LP) token into either Curve or Convex to earn additional yield.\n\nThe Compound pool on Curve has [$174.5M](https://curve.fi/compound/) of TVL relative to the Aave pool which has [$55.3M](https://curve.fi/aave/) of TVL.This is most likely due to the higher incentive APR that the Compound pool, 10.13% vAPY, relative to the Aave pool earning 7.58% vAPY on Convex.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Overview\n\nLlama proposes diversifying $26,67M (94.36%) of the combined Ethereum RFs across three protocols: Convex, Curve and Balancer. The combined Aave V1, AMM, and V2 market RF totals [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) at the time of writing. A detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) and a high-level overview is shown in the figure below.\n\n**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bst-8FdWe_RfGSXcDYeItuso4X58wWylaIo06XSnRjax0JJ7UfnjUPM7p-5bGYdu6QrdtGkkUzbzyu5kLe-4a17tLCFY5WD5Wj6gPD7YSuoHfjVfsqNfy2nlM47NQNmZPp7GeQKH \"Chart\")**\n\nThe table below shows the assets that will be deployed within this proposal. Note this is only 94.4% of the assets and 5.6% of the assets are to remain unchanged within the Aave V2 RF.**\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c10a19f49f9edbbd241d7a280d0a0541e2bf9316.png)\n\n\nThe table above includes the following stablecoins, DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD and sUSD from the Aave V1 and V2 markets. The AMM markets holdings have not been included as they only total $119.3K at the time of writing.\n\nThe table below shows asset allocation per each strategy:\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/33eaba04a8080fdd0c5b6496090155a98965bab4.png)\n\nThe balance within the Aave V2 RF, not deployed in one of the above strategies is shown as Other (Longtailed Assets) in the figure below. The percentages reflect the overall composition of the RF, noting that 94.4% of the consolidated RF is deployed into one of the strabled detailed in the above table.\n\n**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DLtTpPMVMYL0mhKSaCrroYwwD4r3-3uRDgwUjLIeZjrmMwnQ8i7-PSfgrwnHJLJnd5b4GfeTIhVuaW1emtWc12o-YFyQTqgVMOMyPni023sKbTxZFpyneBVCGu_eV3u-UuvOcsLc \"Chart\")**\n\nThe actual implementation of this proposal is likely to be spread across several AIPs. This is to reduce the implementation complexity and allow the several positions to be swapped / redeemed before being deployed into a bonding curve whilst we await the Chainlink CVX oracle being released and getting the Aave V2 RF whitelisted to deposit into the CRV locking contract to attain veCRV.\n\nThe subsequent sections provide further insight into each strategy and how they are to be funded.\n\n## Convex / Curve Strategy\n\n### Convex Allocation\n\nThe Convex (CVX) allocation is to be funded by the assets mentioned in the table below:\n\n**![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/468f451db851df2f8c4ec9f3bc28fd81647492da.png)**\n\nIn order to fund the initial $2M purchase of CVX, all of the AMPL, BUSD and TUSD will be used ($842.2K) and the balance, $1,16M, will be funded with USDC. This is the initial purchase of CVX and with a unit price of $43.20 is equivalent to about 46,300 CVX tokens.\n\nWe expect to make additional CVX purchases in order to meet the minimum voting hurdle required to influence how Convex’s veCRV holding is deployed on Curve gauges. Based upon this [snapshot](https://vote.convexfinance.com/#/proposal/QmRgsaGswSgzuzaiiH385StTGsv5TVdhAA1LWBGWR3yyLp) and the [Voting Rules and Information](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/voting-and-gauge-weights) section of Convex’s documentation, we estimate around 70,000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate. This is expected to cost a further $1.02M to what is proposed above and represents less than 1 months revenue. We intend to fund this through future revenue and have a sufficient buffer to the hurdle rate based upon voter participation on Convex’s snapshot.\n\nThe assets are to be converted to ETH and then used to purchase CVX via a Bonding Curve with a 50 bps premium that utilizes a Chainlink oracle price feed. Alternative methods can be discussed in the comments. However, we opt for a solution that can be implemented entirely through the AIP governance process and does not include manual trading.\n\nAMPL is the most illiquid of the mentioned tokens and this position will need to be converted to ETH over a series of transactions. Trades are to be routed through an aggregator with MEV protection like CowSwap. The most liquid AMPL pools are on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap. Wherever possible, aTokens will be swapped rather than redeemed in an attempt to retain TVL in the Aave V2 market.\n\nThe newly acquired CVX will be locked for 16 weeks with voting rights delegated to Llama in order to vote on both Aave and sAave gauges via Convex’s snapshot to increase the amount of CRV rewards received on the Curve pools. Voting occurs every 2 weeks via Snapshot and thus the need for a delegate.\n\nThe locked CVX also receives a portion of the protocol fee income and votes on how Convex’s veCRV are distributed across Curve’s gauges. Llama Community acting as the delegate will vote to boost CRV rewards on the Aave pool as a priority and sAave once sufficient voting influence has been attained.\n\n### 4 Year Locked Curve (veCRV) Allocation\n\nThe aCRV tokens that have accumulated within Aave V2 are to be redeemed for CRV and then locked for 4 years on Curve to receive an equal amount of veCRV. This strategy is subject to Aave’s V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curve’s governance process.\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/21477469e7d025cafd72614e98c3e6cd4e3236cf.png)\n\nThe veCRV position will then be used to vote for CRV incentives to be allocated to the Aave and sAave pools via the respective gauges. Based on the CVX strategy discussed prior, these veCRV votes are likely to be allocated to the sAave gauge.\n\nSubject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curve’s veCRV contract, the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV, then stake to earn CRV, CVX and 3crv, pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders. This is expected to generate 47.35% vAPY, see snippet below.\n\n**![|602x244](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v6jyNfHVIrr7ovNveVCupxypxFTzoZfLAP3_aGSwRHVcNezLxZIPvmmLHitPMI7TzrFRm9G-SRpimpcuJqnZLX-OvJ5SUai1_2jStwPxr02Uyge60q2WDCx0dS4eU4GnwAblDACD)**\n\nThe earned CRV will be converted to cvxCRV and this will compound over time. The earned CVX will be locked to increase Aave’s voting influence and the 3crv will be exchanged for CRV, then converted to cvxCRV to further compound the strategies returns over time.\n\n### Productive aToken Stable Strategy\n\nThe sAave and Aave strategies include depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE, CVX and CRV rewards. The two strategies are expected to generate around 4.07% vAPY and 6.19% vAPY before Aave’s CRV and CVX voting influences the CRV incentive derived yield.\n\nThe table below shows the allocation, how each strategy is funded, and which pool those funds are to be deposited into.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/03ca5c3d9bf70c960c6769e35b6a630d64b6ce18.png)\n\n### Productive ETH Strategy\n\nAfter transferring the ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF, the awETH is to be redeemed for ETH and the combined ETH deposited into the Curve stETH pool. The LP token steCRV is to then be deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV, CVX and LDO incentives. The expected yield is around 6.65% vAPY.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/3d101f6f395bb1310f0d58031136da366e6ee838.png)\n\nNo vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used to attract CRV incentives on this pool as the pool does not contain any aTokens.\n\n## Balancer Strategy\n\n### Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy\n\nBalancer has recently launched the first [Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe?utm_source=website&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=aaveboostedpools) on Wednesday 16th December and liquidity mining incentives have already commenced generating around 13.4% vAPY at the time of writing. Using the [Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063) as a guide, we expect Balancer to grow the Boosted Pool with the use of Liquidity Mining (LM) and even replace the Stable Pool in time.\n\nThe Balancer Boosted Pools earn swap fee income, LM incentives, and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield. Llama expects the yield of the Boosted pool to exceed the Stable Pool in order to entice users to move across. Llama expects LM incentives to be the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase.\n\nThe strategy for Aave is to deposit an equal amount of DAI, USDC and USDT into the Boosted Pool. All BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/57b902e46f625cfea122142b56fd0d0ccbe75579.png)\n\nPost is to long.\n\nsee: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797",

Upon implementation of this upgrade, via a successful Snapshot vote, assets can no longer be add/introduced to the Aave v2 deployments.  \n\n**Note: The Aave Arc & Centrifuge RWA markets, which are powered by the \"Permissioned\" V2 codebase are not included. These liquidity pools support the latest battletested version of the \"Permissioned\" code base.**\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal seeks to begin the transition from v2 to v3 deployments. The first step in this progression is to focus our efforts on growing the v3 deployments whilst continuing to actively support the v2 deployments in all other areas. Going forward all future asset listings are to be limited to only v3 deployments.\n\nSuccessful passing of this ARFC will indicate the DAO has decided that the various V3 deployments are the future of the Aave DAO, and support of the various listed markets will be limited to Risk and Critical Technical Updates. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe Aave Community upon successfully voting on Snapshot to implement this upgrade, will prevent any further assets from being added to any of the following Aave Market pools<!--deployments-->, as identified by their LendingPool Addresses.\n\n- Ethereum V1 Market [0x398eC7346DcD622eDc5ae82352F02bE94C62d119](https://etherscan.io/address/0x398eC7346DcD622eDc5ae82352F02bE94C62d119)\n- Ethereum V1 Uniswap Market [0x2F60C3EB259D63dcCa81fDE7Eaa216D9983D7C60](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2F60C3EB259D63dcCa81fDE7Eaa216D9983D7C60)\n- Ethereum V2 Market [0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9)\n- Ethereum V2 AMM Market [0x7937d4799803fbbe595ed57278bc4ca21f3bffcb](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7937d4799803fbbe595ed57278bc4ca21f3bffcb)\n- Polygon V2 Market [0x8dff5e27ea6b7ac08ebfdf9eb090f32ee9a30fcf](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8dff5e27ea6b7ac08ebfdf9eb090f32ee9a30fcf)\n- Avalanche V2 Market [0x4F01AeD16D97E3aB5ab2B501154DC9bb0F1A5A2C](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x4F01AeD16D97E3aB5ab2B501154DC9bb0F1A5A2C) \n\nReferences: [Aave v1 Docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/1.0/deployed-contracts), [Aave v2 Docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/deployed-contracts/deployed-contracts)\n\nThis represents the first progression toward deprecating the v1 & v2 deployments across all networks.\n\n# Implementation\n\nCriteria for a success Snapshot vote, the Short Executor criteria must be met:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dYTmICE.png)\n\nReference: https://docs.aave.com/governance/aips\n\nA Snapshot will be created on the 30th November with the vote commencing on the 1st December.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
