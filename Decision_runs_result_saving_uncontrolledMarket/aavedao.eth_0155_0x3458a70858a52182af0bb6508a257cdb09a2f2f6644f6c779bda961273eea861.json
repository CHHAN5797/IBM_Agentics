RLUSD intends to bridge TradFi with DeFi use cases, starting with its flagship payments products serving customers in over 70 markets. They aim to establish RLUSD as the de facto stablecoin for lending/borrowing, DeFi, repo, Treasury functions, payments, etc., all within the highest levels of compliance.\n\nOnboarding Ripple's RLUSD extends Aave Protocol's diverse stablecoin offerings to its users. RLUSD users on Aave Protocol may potentially benefit from future rewards programs. This introduction is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nAligning with Aave DAO’s commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand assets, onboarding RLUSD will enable users to leverage Ripple’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. The initial slow launch of RLUSD is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and attract more mainstream users, contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n## Specification- **Ticker**: RLUSD  \n- Contract addresses will be added during the ARFC stage once RLUSD is fully launched.  - Risk parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers as soon as possible, and the ARFC will be updated with that feedback\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Ripple and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, escalate the proposal to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

MakerDAO marked a significant milestone with a rebranded to Sky, introducing USDS and sUSDS as the new iterations of DAI and sDAI. Given the established track record and widespread adoption of their predecessors, we propose to onboard these new assets to Aave v3.\n\nBy integrating USDS and sUSDS into Aave v3, we aim to maintain continuity for users who have relied on DAI and sDAI while embracing the evolution of these assets under the Sky brand.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nSky protocol team has discussed providing both token incentives and liquidity provision when USDS is onboarded. ACI is in discussion with members of Sky protocol team to finalize these programs.  \n\n### **Specification**\n\nBased on discussion with members of Sky protocol team, we propose the following: \n\n- sUSDS added as collateral and borrow asset to Aave v3 Main Instance\n- USDS added as supply and borrow asset to Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Integration with Paraswap to allow users to seamlessly swap between DAI and USDS variants within the Aave system.\n\nWe invite all service providers and community members to weigh in on these suggestions. \n\nFinal contract addresses will be provided upon final launch of the Sky protocol.  \n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Sky and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks. Aave stands to gain significantly as a primary partner in this expansion, following the successful playbook of cbBTC, which quickly scaled through similar collaborative efforts.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: 0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364\n\nChainlink oracle: upcoming\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: Bitcoin Reserve Address | FBTC\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: FBTC proof of assets dashboard\n\nGitHub: GitHub - fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: fbtc-contract/audits at main · fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract · GitHub\n\nTwitter: x.com\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\nDisclosure\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublish a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "# Author: [@ACI](https://governance.aave.com/u/aci) (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n# Date: 2024-09-10\n\n## Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to onboard Coinbase’s cbBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol on Base.\n\n## Motivation\n\ncbBTC, a new Bitcoin wrapper offering from Coinbase, is set to launch in the coming weeks. As a centralized and trusted entity in the cryptocurrency space, Coinbase’s entry into the wrapped Bitcoin market with cbBTC brings a unique value proposition to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nThis new asset will diversify the options available for Bitcoin holders looking to participate in DeFi activities on Aave v3. The introduction of cbBTC to Aave v3 will provide users with more choices for utilizing their Bitcoin holdings, increasing liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nFurthermore, cbBTC’s integration aligns with Aave’s commitment to offering a wide range of high-quality assets. It will enable users to tap into Coinbase’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. This synergy between a major centralized exchange and a leading DeFi protocol could attract more mainstream users to Aave, contributing to the overall growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n**Benefits of listing cbBTC:**\n\nWith the ongoing changes with WBTC it is pertinent to have alternative wrapped BTC tokens for use on Aave. With Coinbase as the issuer and custodian, their reputation will likely make this a trustworthy alternative to WBTC.\n\n### **Market Impact**\n\nThe addition of cbBTC may take marketshare from existing wrapped BTC assets including WBTC but as the purpose is to provide an alternative, this is not seen as negative. Overall, it is believed this will have slight positive impact on BTC asset adoption on Aave.\n\n### **Chain to be deployed**\n\nThis will be deployed on Base and ETH mainnet.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and deposit commitments:**\n\nThere will be $150,000 of incentives over 3 months from the Aave Merit program. \n\nThere are interested parties however, no concrete deposit commitments can be made until pool parameters have been set.\n\n### **Useful links**\n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-cbbtc-to-aave-v3-on-base/18805\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: cbBTC\n\nContract address for both Mainnet and Base: 0xcbb7c0000ab88b473b1f5afd9ef808440eed33bf\n\nFollowing the above analysis, we recommend listing cbETH on Aave V3’s Ethereum deployment. We recommend the following parameter settings:\n\n| Parameter | Value (Ethereum) | Value (Base) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 450 | 200 |\n| Borrow Cap | 45 | 20 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - | - |\n| LTV | 73% | 73% |\n| LT | 78% | 78% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0% | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4% | 4% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300% | 300% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% | 45% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20% | 20% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A | N/A |\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Coinbase and did not receive compensation for creation of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "The proposal to add PAXG to the Aave v3 Main Instance on Ethereum is well-supported by the vote timeline metrics indicating unanimous support for 'YAE' throughout the voting period. Forum sentiment is mostly neutral with some negative remarks mainly about the ARFC stage and incentive details, but no strong opposition. Similar past proposals to add new assets also passed with strong support and led to modest positive outcomes. The recommendation aligns with the community's overall sentiment and aims to diversify collateral options, which is beneficial for protocol growth and user engagement.",
