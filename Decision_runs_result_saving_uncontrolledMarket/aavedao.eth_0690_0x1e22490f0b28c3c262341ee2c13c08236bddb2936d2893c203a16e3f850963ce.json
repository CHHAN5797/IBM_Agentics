        "body": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters, including Liquidation Threshold and Liquidation Bonus across four (4) Aave V2 assets. \n\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for CRV and ENJ.** The community has aligned on a [Risk Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) regarding lowering liquidation thresholds. \n\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zW3mXLO.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6AnD7kE.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L5VsbrR.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top CRV non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8RwGtti.png)\n\n**Top DAI non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xo6pCby.png)\n\n**Top ENJ non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3SOtHAm.png)\n\n**Top LINK non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5wxtQRV.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nGauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to maintain protocol market risk at safe levels while optimizing for capital efficiency.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| **CRV Liquidation Threshold**    | 65%     | ***64%***     |\n| DAI Liquidation Threshold     | 80%     | 85%     |\n| DAI Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |\n| **ENJ Liquidation Threshold**     | 70%     | ***67%***     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 6.0%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Threshold     | 78%     | 83%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 7.0%     |\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 07/01 to 08/03.

This could change if prices move significantly. On a daily basis, up until this proposal is executed, we will check whether these parameter updates will cause any liquidations and update the community on the forum post.\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters, including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus across three (3) Aave V2 assets. \n\nIn addition, this ARC proposes adjusting two (2) total risk parameters, including LTV and Liquidation Threshold, across one (1) Aave Arc (Fireblocks) asset.\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet’s regular parameter recommendations. Following the recent market crash, our simulation engine has ingested the latest market data (outlined below) to recalibrate parameters for the Aave protocol. **Please note that this set of parameter changes will be lowering liquidation threshold for LINK and WETH.** \n\nThese parameter updates also represent Gauntlet's first set of parameter updates for the Aave Arc market.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet's simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations. \n\nFor more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd). \n\n### Supporting Data on Aave V2\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HQ5c5T0.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Sr4q4Mh.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/I90tK6y.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top LINK non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zx0G68o.png)\n\n**Top WBTC non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yAclipo.png)\n\n**Top WETH non-recursive supplies and collateralization ratios:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/r7KX1HS.png)\n\n## Aave V2 Parameter Changes Specification\n\nOur recent [market downturn report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-february-2022-updates-and-review/7476) showed that many collaterals are resilient to insolvencies, as our simulation models have predicted. Gauntlet's simulation engine will continue to adjust risk parameters to drive increases in capital efficiency while maintaining protocol risk at safe levels. \n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| LINK Loan To Value     | 70%     | 67%     |\n| LINK Liquidation Bonus    | 6.3%     | 5.0%     |\n| **LINK Liquidation Threshold**     | 78%     | ***75%***     |\n| WBTC Loan To Value     | 70%     | 69%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Bonus    | 6.5%     | 5.0%     |\n| WBTC Liquidation Threshold     | 75%     | 76%     |\n| WETH Loan To Value     | 82.5%     | 81%     |\n| WETH Liquidation Bonus    | 5.0%     | 4.0%     |\n| **WETH Liquidation Threshold**     | 85%     | ***83%***     |\n\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 05/13 to 05/26. These are valuable metrics to build intuition but are not the only inputs our simulations take into account to make parameter recommendations. \n\n|Symbol| 05-26 Volatility| 05-13 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%)  |\n| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |\n| LINK   | \t  1.560317105       |  1.407103695  | \t0.15321341   |  -67.2106437    |\n| WBTC    |  \t0.855923268     |   0.823403106    | \t0.032520162    |  -64.0842057 |\n| WETH    |   0.90963415     |  0.832421096      | 0.077213054  |  \t-69.59337  |\n\n## Aave Arc (Fireblocks) Parameter Changes Specification\n\nOur simulation platform indicates that increasing the capital efficiency of USDC collateral does not meaningfully increase the risk of insolvencies. Note that, on our dashboard, the Value at Risk (VaR) metric for Aave Arc is currently $0. This low risk of insolvencies is reflective of the fact that the majority of borrowing on the platform is collateralized by the same asset as the assets being borrowed. As lending market usage grows, our platform will continue to ingest up-to-date data, re-run risk simulations, and make future parameter change recommendations.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| USDC Loan To Value     | 85.5%     | 87.5%     |\n| USDC Liquidation Threshold     | 88%     | 90%     |\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Aave V2 Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. Gauntlet has also launched the [Aave Arc Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave_arc).\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n### Aave V2 Dashboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vdil33O.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2022-05-31\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

While loan-to-value and liquidation bonus are also useful means of reducing the risk of insolvency, they are not effective substitutes. \n\nOver the last several weeks, Gauntlet has collaborated with BGD Labs, Llama, Governance House, and other community stakeholders to align on how to most effectively serve the protocol regarding the tradeoffs between value creation and protection. \n\nLiquidation threshold reductions can impact users in a number of ways. In particular, if a user's account health is low, this type of parameter change can render the account eligible for liquidation. \n\nIf a user rebalances their position ahead of a liquidation threshold reduction, they will avoid liquidation. For this reason, Gauntlet will provide notice to the community via communication channels that may include the forums and Twitter, among others.\n\nThat said, there is always some chance that a user will not monitor their health factor or fail to supply collateral in time, resulting in \"risk-off liquidations\".\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nBGD, Llama, Governance House, and other community members have emphasized that these liquidations impinge on the borrower user experience. It is therefore important that the community explicitly aligns on a desired maximum reduction to liquidation thresholds per AIP.\n\nCommunity input is also valuable because limits on LT reduction impose an important trade-off:\n1. A lower max LT reduction will minimize the impact to borrowers but at the cost of reducing the rate at which risk can be taken off. This, in turn, limits the extent to which leverage can be increased during favorable conditions, making Aave less capital efficient and coming at the cost of borrow volume. \n2. A higher max LT reduction will strengthen Aave's ability to maximize capital efficiency under favorable market conditions but increase the potential for risk-off liquidations.\n\n\n---\n\nThe options for this Snapshot vote are the following: Per AIP, each collateral asset's liquidation threshold may be reduced by an absolute percentage of up to:\n* 3% (see point (2) above)\n* 2%\n* 1% (see point (1) above)\n* 0% (no risk management)\n* Abstain\n\nNote:\n* *This limit would **not** apply under severe conditions, such as a contract vulnerability.* \n* *It **would** apply to all collateral assets Gauntlet supports, including WETH, WBTC, DAI, &c. [2].*\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## \n[1] Please find a detailed explanation of Gauntlet's Risk Management methodology [here](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c).\n\n[2] A complete list of currently supported assets can be found [here](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave).",

        "body": "\n\n[Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-12-16/6646)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust nine (9) total risk parameters across seven (7) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.\n![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https://i.imgur.com/gDTtU13.png)\nAlthough volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.\n\nFor reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31\n\nAlthough some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| BAT Loan To Value     | 70%     | 75%     |\n| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |\n| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |\n| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |\n| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n\n**Freezing KNCL**\nThe KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.\n\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UV96hoq.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n* Targeting an AIP on 2021-12-20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
