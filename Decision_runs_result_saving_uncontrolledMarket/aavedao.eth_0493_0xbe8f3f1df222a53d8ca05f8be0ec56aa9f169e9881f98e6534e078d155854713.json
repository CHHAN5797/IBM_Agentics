        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal for a series of Reserve Factor (RF) increases across all V2 Ethereum assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our [V2 to V3 migration plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636), we propose a series of RF increases on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\nBy progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on V2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to V3.\n\nThis proposal intends to incrementally increase the reserve factors by 5% at each step. After implementing each increment, we'll assess user elasticity and the impact of the updates before moving forward with additional increases. We will ensure a minimum gap of 2 weeks between each subsequent update.\n\n*Please note that a separate proposal will be made for frozen assets on V2.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Current RF | Recommended RF |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DAI | 10% | 15% |\n| FRAX | 20% | 25% |\n| GUSD | 10% | 15% |\n| LUSD | 10% | 15% |\n| sUSD | 20% | 25% |\n| TUSD | 20% | 25% |\n| USDC | 10% | 15% |\n| USDP | 10% | 15% |\n| USDT | 10% | 15% |\n| 1INCH | 20% | 25% |\n| CRV | 20% | 25% |\n| ENS | 20% | 25% |\n| LINK | 20% | 25% |\n| MKR | 20% | 25% |\n| SNX | 35% | 40% |\n| UNI | 20% | 25% |\n| WBTC | 20% | 25% |\n| ETH | 15% | 20% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit the first Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n3. Subsequent increments will be done directly through an AIP to reduce the governance overhead.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

By matching the Aave V2 parameters, we aim to encourage migration and ensure a smoother transition for users. This proposal does not suggest any changes to Aave V3 caps or interest rate strategies.\n\n### **Proposed Aave V3 Parameter Changes**\nTo make Aave V3 more attractive for migration and to match Aave V2 parameters, we propose the following changes:\n\n1. Loan-to-Value (LTV): Increase the LTV from 60% to 66%.\n2. Liquidation Threshold (LT): Increase the LT from 70% to 73%.\n3. Liquidation Penalty (LP): Maintain the current LP of 7.5%, as it is already in alignment with Aave V2.\n\nNo changes to Aave V3 caps or interest rate strategies are proposed in this ARFC.\n\n### **Recap Table**\n| Parameter                | Current Aave V3 | Current Aave V2 | Proposed Aave V3 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)      | 60%             | 66%             | 66%              |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT)| 70%             | 73%             | 73%              |\n| Liquidation Penalty (LP)  | 7.5%            | 7.5%            | 7.5%             |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal.\nThis ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~26k AAVE or related assets for a value of approx $2M.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Gather feedback and input from the Aave community and risk service providers on the proposed risk parameters and deployment details.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to update the risk parameters on the Aave V3 Ethereum market.\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market climate. \n\nAs Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. We suggest reaching the desired settings with a series of incremental decreases to minimize this impact. This proposal recommends a slightly more aggressive reduction than the one discussed in the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, reducing the LT by 5%.\n\nChaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.\n\nAt the time of writing this post, zero (0) accounts will be affected by the proposed decrease.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 80 | 75 |\n| CRV | LTV | 75 | 70 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) and increase Liquidation Bonus (LB) and Reserve Factors (RF) for eleven (11) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reduce the potential risks associated with V2 markets, we suggest a phased reduction of the **frozen** V2 markets, comprising low-to-medium cap assets with limited liquidity. The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. \n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. \n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n- “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |\n| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |\n| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |\n| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |\n- “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |\n| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |\n| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

With Chainlink expected to monetise oracles, v2 partially frozen and three communities actively distributing rewards on v3, this publication seeks to further encourage the migration of users from v2 to v3.\n\nWith a successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot vote, this publication has incorporated community feedback and presents three options for the community to select from. The key consideration is the upside realized by acting early during the liquidity mining campaign.\n\nThis publication parameter changes supportive of encouraging the migration of funds without putting any users' positions at risk of liquidation.\n\n# Motivation\n\nCurrently, there are three communities distributing four tokens across Polygon v3.\n\n* SD - Stader Labs\n* LDO - Lido DAO\n* MaticX & stMATIC - Polygon Foundation\n\n![|717x331](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3KeyUDurlDkL7kstA4FJOOrJfiPp_-yIJ-_bWZfJdaUMBbR000jzA_sqKMd3-VKSQYGGtXbvl19r2N7tv76wV5qRQxdTu8nH89etXt6y_YIGxWyjU-aabCwDNENicIXSsokR5WGAQvIMAYJ-CFQvIiA)\n\nThis has led to Polygon v3 offering better deposit rates relative to v2. The charts below show the TVL for Polygon v3 since genesis, v3 for 2023 and v2 for 2023. During 2023 TVL in v3 is steadily increasing, the v2 markets TVL is more trending sideways with asset prices broadly trending sideways/higher.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zSVde23.png)\n\nLiquidity Mining (LM) on v3 is helping to pull users across and the migration tool from BGD further supports this initiative. At TokenLogic, we believe more can be done to migrate users and it is better to do this whilst LM is ongoing. This publication at its core seeks to accelerate the migration of users from v2 to v3 whilst LM is ongoing.\n\nThe [TEMP CHECK](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x478169c0840488588b31d7e23b889b5f9442057db9c7a5b9b6cfdd61fe7108ff) received strong support from the community with 525k votes, 92.42%, in favor of implementing the change. This publication incorporated feedback from the comments on the previous governance forum post and now includes two additional reduced impact options for the community to consider.\n\nIncorporating feedback from the community, TokenLogic is presenting three options to the community for consideration. Options 1) and 2) include adjusting the Uoptimal and Reserve Factor (RF) parameters where as Option 3 includes only adjusting the RF parameter:\n\n* Option 1 - Adjust Uoptimal & RF Aggressive\n  * Reduce Uoptimal by 50.00% the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal value\n  * Increase RF such that deposit yield remains the same\n  * Maintain the same Slope2 gradient\n* Option 2 - Adjust Uoptimal & RF Conservative\n  * Reduce Uoptimal by 33.33% the difference between current utilization and Uoptimal value\n  * Increase RF such that deposit yield remains the same\n  * Maintain the same Slope2 gradient\n* Option 3 - Increase RF\n  * Increase RF such that deposit yield is reduced by 20%\n\nThe below table compares the outcome of Option 1, 2 and 3.\n\n![|717x219](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MAHb1zay_-dKkRpPc5Wu1axIHPQZt18ubCXJaPSSI8ILI1PJuB_BeKqKYGeyfVGp6dkKHEhzvFF2UzAjC5pjXf6GGha6TTVYLFQyMhcuRWRAkP0gR0rQ1gwlUP3KHZlEy71sQuof4AqKHmsb9KlrMko)\n\nImplementing any of the three options above will further encourage users to migrate from v2 to v3. Option 3 affects only deposit rates and thus increases the deposit rate differential between the markets as the borrowing rate remains unchanged on v2. Option 3 relies on depositors migrating liquidity, due to lower deposit rate, to increase the borrowing cost over time. Whereas Option 1 and 2 directly increase the borrowing cost for users whilst keeping deposit rates the same which encourages borrowers to migrate.\n\nOption 1 and 2 - leverage strategies and simply deposit to draw a loan users will experience higher borrowing rates. Structured leverage products will experience increased vol decay (deposit yield - borrowing yield - rebalancing/recentreing costs). Do note, the feasibility of structured 2x leverage products is more sensitive to LTV & LT changes, as reducing these parameters can break the strategy. Reducing the Uoptimal and increasing the RF means structured products remain viable, however, like all debt positions, there are higher holding costs over time. Option 3 impacts these products less as the collateral type is not normally stable coins and more likely to be high vol assets which typically have very low deposit rates.\n\nAn example of Option 3, deposit wMATIC borrow USDC and swap for wMATIC for 2x leverage is affected by changing the RF as the deposit rate on wMATIC falls. But as wMATIC deposit rate is already low, 0.73% relative to 3.29% on v3. Increasing the RF from 20% to 36%, reducing deposit rate from 0.73% to 0.58%, 0.15%, will have less impact as increasing the borrowing costs on USDC from 2.99% to 3.40%, 0.41% via Option 2.\n\n## Uoptimal\n\nUsing Option 1 as an example, the revised Uoptimal parameter is the midpoint between current utilization and Uoptimal values. Ie: If utilization is 20% and the Uoptimal is 60%, then the proposed Uoptimal is 40%, the midpoint between the existing utilization and Uoptimal value.\n\n## Slope 2\n\nBy reducing the Uoptimal parameter, the gradient of the borrow rate between utilisations Uoptimal and 100% is lowered. In order to maintain the current gradient, the Slope2 parameter is revised higher. In the image below, Option 1, the Slope 2 parameter changes from 75% to 124% in response to the Uoptimal parameter being reduced from 80% to 60%. Notice how the red and blue lines are parallel during the second leg of the curve, this is because they have the same gradient.\n\n![|680x420](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8ieERUcmKnMq5zNhNHVN2CSRvkxuAM15EUvFack5dRtxc_3vFHEK4h5T0deFqjVSZj6c8ZeC8Ykvi5oVZBpj6PaBK0LhlvnM8bKCrit9UVt9OjsDDzk7I7M_g0QEAYzDhL4b2yKVqNdmk2S6TO42frw \"Chart\")\n\n## Reserve Factor\n\nAs a portion of the interest paid by borrowers is directed to users who provide liquidity, by increasing the borrow rate, the deposit rate also increases assuming the reserves utilization remains unchanged. To counter the higher deposit rate, which encourages more deposits, the RF is increased. This redirects interest paid by borrowers to Aave instead of depositors.\n\nDue to abnormally high USDT usage, 77.49% at the time of writing, this proposal suggests increasing the RF to be the average of proposed DAI and USDC RFs. The justification for this is to reduce the deposit rate of USDT, such that it encourages migration whilst avoiding reducing the Uoptimal such that borrowing cost increases substantially by shifting utilizing onto the more stepper portion of the yield curve. When utilization drops by a material amount, it would be prudent to reduce the Uoptiomal value in line with other stable coins.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe tables below detail the proposed parameter changes to achieve the outcome defined in the table above.\n\n![|717x219](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mdzqLwCzZfM2ws3svjTqRDSFdnss9BA9tBYURaFAaBcgZIfplNPNr1ztr8CRskyhhhAHOLtkkM9PbduUIuwBpqAViSnl481DtN3E0KoU2ij_i4rM-H3wj-jrJ9b3z9odgFzm1nYQALjMRopazvBU_SE)\n\n![|401x217](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wCVm6E9JA-0Um7aXIv-tPYdricROWU0XfPispV4pUNfOM4U41DsL2TNhve3Hwb4EKPI195EIp2MxvBMVtMzQG4vcpf5W3Z8_lqMlPyb0CtrR8rrY9QhHlBbbVQo7SDFUrve53e3PnKX3bZRjY5qzHQ4)\n\nPrior to any AIP submission the numbers should be updated in line with the strategy to avoid any un-favourable parameter configurations.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe author, TokenLogic, is only paid by Aave DAO via Butter as part of the [Incentivised Delegate Campaign](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732).\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). \n![Screenshot 2023-04-30 at 19.46.09.png](ipfs://bafkreiedatwzrimn6mukrp6cnli5egaxqcadwwyjaceiuppabusmfkdjuy)\n    ",
