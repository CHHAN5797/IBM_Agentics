        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Framework for ARFC and TEMP CHECK Proposals\nAuthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative\nDate: 2023-06-27\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis framework provides comprehensive guidelines for the Aave DAO community when creating and voting on ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) and TEMP CHECK proposals. It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC\n\nTEMP CHECKs serve as \"temperature checks\" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.\n\nConversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.\n\n### Proposal Template\n\nEach proposal **must** include the following sections:\n\nA header:\n1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.\n2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.\n3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nA proposal body:\n\n1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.\n2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.\n5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.\n6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.\n\n### Voting Guidelines\n\n1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.\n2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.\n3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.\n4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.\n5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.\n6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.\n\n### Proposal Cycle:\n\n![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nThis framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community.\n\nThis framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community's views.\n\n## Specification\n\nAs this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps \n\n1) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2) If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Swap Upgrade\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @defiJesus & @efecarranza \ncreated: 2023-11-02\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThs publication proposes that the Aave DAO engages TokenLogic to upgrade the Aave Swap Contract to include Limit Orders and TWAP swap functionality.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe intial iteration of the Aave Swap contract includes the functionality to swap one asset for another within a pre-defined variance relative to Chainlink Oracle(s). ie: Chainlink Oracle +/- 50bps slippage including gas cost. \n\nIn recent proposals, the DAO has committed to using the Cowswap TWAP functionality to acquire AURA. This highlights a functionality gap on the Aave Swap contract. This publication proposes upgrading the swap contract to include TWAP functionality. The TWAP feature is to use the new Composable COW (Composable Conditional Orders). An example is shown below:\n\nAlice wants to sell 12,000,000 DAI for at least 7500 WETH. She wants to do this using a TWAP, executing a part each day over a period of 30 days.\n\n`sellToken` = DAI\n`buytoken` = WETH\n`receiver` = address(0)\n`partSellAmount` = 12000000 / 30 = 400000 DAI\n`minPartLimit` = 7500 / 30 = 250 WETH\n`t0` = Nominated start time (unix epoch seconds)\n`n` = 30 (number of parts)\n`t` = 86400 (duration of each part, in seconds)\n`span` = 0 (duration of span, in seconds, or 0 for entire interval)\n\nIf Alice also wanted to restrict the duration in which each part traded in each day, she may set span to a non-zero duration. For example, if Alice wanted to execute the TWAP, each day for 30 days, however only wanted to trade for the first 12 hours of each day, she would set span to 43200 (ie. 60 * 60 * 12). Using span allows for use cases such as weekend or week-day only trading.\n\nWhilst integration the TWAP functionality, this publication proposes adding Limit Order functionality. The lift to do so is minimal and it offers additional functionality. Limit Orders enable the DAO to swap one asset for a minimum amount of the received asset. ie: Swap 1 ETH for a minimum 1700 USDC. \n\nTo support the developers using the Aave Swap contract, this publication proposes creating a command-line interface (CLI) using Tenderly to verify if the swaps can be executed at prevailing market conditions. This tool serves the dual purpose of ascertaining the feasibility of a swap and help the developer to determine the appropriate slippage percentage to use.\n\nSlippage in the context of COW Swap does not mean that it will be that number, COW Swap matches orders on a best case basis and the actual cost of the full transaction could be lower. The slippage mentioned here is a worst case scenario that takes into account both the counter-party's price as well as gas costs. Slippage as commonly known could be 0.1% and 0.9% could be gas costs depending on the network utilization at the time of the swap, assuming a 1% slippage. Even allowing for 1% slippage, once executed, the total gas costs + real slippage might end up only being 0.5%.\n\n# Specification\n\n## TWAP Orders\n\nUsing Composable Cow upgrade the Aave Swap contract to perform TWAP swaps.\n\nThe details on Composable Cow can be found [here](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow).\n\nThis upgrade involves adding a Payload template and tests cases.\n\n## Limit Orders\n\nUsing the new price checker introduced by Milkman, upgrade the Aave Swap contract to perform limit order swap. \n\nThis upgrade involves adding a Payload template and tests cases.\n\n## Tenderly\n\nCreate a CLI tool that uses Tenderly to proactively verify the feasibility of proposed swaps.\n\nThis tool offers an approximate assessment of whether a trade with the specified parameters is attainable. It will return `true` for a swap that is likely to succeed and `false` if not likely to succeed. If not likely, then the user can check with a bigger slippage tolerance.\n\nCould also extend it to suggest a slippage given the size of the order and market conditions. \n\nWe want to again reiterate that because of the nature of DAO governance, once the payload is executed, conditions might have changed so we always recommend extending a bit the MAX allowed slippage to account for this.\n\n# Funding\n\nTo facilitate the development, this publication seeks the following funding:\n\n**Funding Amount:** $12,672.00 USD, to be paid in GHO.\n**Delivery Schedule:** 5 weeks, which includes an estimated 2wk review period.\n\nAs part of our normal process, we intend to submit our work to @bgdlabs for review. We do this to ensure our work is of the highest quality.\n\nThe transfer of funds will occur with an AIP submission upon successfully completing the scope. \n\nThe Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:\n\n1) YAE\n2) NAE\n3) ABSTAIN\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.\n3) Upon delivering the scope, TokenLogic will submit a AIP to create an allowance or transfer for equivalent 12,672.00 USD settled in GHO.\n\nThe DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

        "author": "0x935aE149899856F9370be6f4a8E40eb622270eA0",
        "body": "**Title: [ARFC] GHO Steward: Agile Parameter Changes**\n\n**Author: [@AaveCompanies](https://governance.aave.com/u/aavecompanies)**\n\n**Date: 12th July 2023**\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes implementing the dedicated GHO Steward as a dynamic parameter change mechanism to ensure efficient risk management and support the peg of Aave Protocol’s native multi-collateral stablecoin GHO during the initial stages.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nAs the Aave DAO prepares for the introduction of GHO, it is crucial for the community to consider implementing a mechanism that offers greater agility to adjust risk parameters in the initial stages of launch.\n\nTo support the maintenance of the peg, the proposed GHO Steward multisig acts as a dynamic parameter change mechanism. It enables swift adjustments to risk parameters in the form of scoped governance delegation where the full governance process could potentially be time-consuming and hinder timely response to evolving circumstances.\n\nBy employing this mechanism, the Aave Protocol ensures transparency and enables flexible parameter changes through decentralized governance. This approach reinforces commitment to preserving the peg and effectively addressing market challenges that may arise upon the launch of GHO.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\nThe “bucket capacity” refers to the maximum amount of GHO that can be minted by a Facilitator. The ability to adapt the bucket capacity by adjusting supply supports stability by ensuring that available supply meets demand.\n\nThe “borrow rate” refers to the interest rate paid when borrowing GHO. The borrowing rate may also be used to support stability because of its impact on demand.\n\nYou can learn more about GHO in the docs [here](https://docs.gho.xyz/).\n\n### **GHO Steward Permissions**\n\nAave V3 provides a high level of granularity around permissions. Building on the concept of [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937/4), it is proposed that a dedicated GHO Steward multisig be introduced to support the initial GHO governance risk mechanism to enable the implementation of agile parameter changes in the form of scoped governance delegation.\n\nThe GHO Steward multisig would be 2/2 and would include the DAO’s risk providers Chaos Labs and Gauntlet.\n\nThe GHO Steward would be capable of adjusting predefined parameters including: increasing the bucket capacity (by up to 100%) and changing the borrow rate (by up to 100 basis points in either direction) in a single change. Parameter updates could only occur once every 5 days per the parameter.\n\nIt is proposed that the GHO Steward would be deactivated 90 days after the passing of this proposal. However, the DAO can vote to renew the GHO Steward for another 90 days if deemed necessary. The DAO can also vote to remove the GHO Steward at any time.\n\n### **Governance Process**\n\nThis proposal emphasizes the importance of decentralization and community involvement in the decision-making process, fostering a robust and inclusive ecosystem. The GHO Risk Steward would enable agile parameter changes for GHO; however, decisions shouldn’t be made in isolation and should go through a lean governance process.\n\nThe proposed lean process is as follows:\n\n1. Proposal on the Governance Forum explaining the rationale of the proposed action.\n2. Snapshot requirements:\n    \n    a. 24-hour duration starting from the posting of the proposal\n    \n    b. Quorum 250,000 AAVE\n    \n    c. A minimum of 70% of votes FOR the change\n    \n3. Change can be enacted as soon as the proposal passes Snapshot.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the GHO Steward serves as an initial agile parameter change mechanism driven by decentralized governance. It highlights the Aave Protocol’s commitment to maintaining GHO stability and addressing market challenges during the launch period.\n\nWhile the proposal acknowledges the potential for a more dynamic rate-changing governance model in the future, the current framework allows the DAO to effectively manage GHO’s parameters in the short term.\n\n## **Specification**\n\n### **Capabilities:**\n\n1. **Capacity Increase:** It can increase the bucket capacity by up to 100%. This is strictly an upward adjustment; the capacity cannot be decreased by the GHO Steward.\n2. **Borrow Rate Adjustment:** It can adjust the borrow rate by up to 1%, either upwards or downwards.\n\n### **Configuration:**\n\n1. **Permissions:** The GHO Steward is granted PoolAdmin in the Aave Protocol and BucketManager for the GHO token.\n2. **Risk Council:** This Multisig is solely responsible for triggering actions through the GHO Steward contract. The address of this entity cannot be changed.\n3. **Execution Time Delay:** Any parameter change made by the GHO Steward contract, such as increasing bucket capacity or adjusting the borrow rate, is limited to once within the time delay period. e.g.,GHO Steward can only change a parameter once 5 days have passed since the last parameter change for that specific parameter.\n4. **Lifespan:** The GHO Steward contract will initially only have a lifespan of 90 days. The lifespan is designed to ensure regular review of the necessity of this approach.\n5. **Steward Lifespan Extension:** The DAO can extend the lifespan of the GHO Steward for additional 90-day periods as many times as it wants.\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nN/A\n\n### **Links**\n\n- Codebase: [GitHub](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/src/contracts/misc/GhoSteward.sol)\n- Audit Report: [GitHub](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/13-06-2023_SigmaPrime_GhoSteward.pdf)\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to AIP stage.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This could be to reduce the DAOs exposure to long tail assets or to increase stable coin holdings to facilitate payment to various service providers. It is not possible to perform swaps directly from the Collector / Treasury Contract. After much discussion, @llamaxyz and @bgdlabs have concluded that it is not viable to upgrade the Collector Contract to facilitate the efficient management of the DAO's assets. As a result, a series of separate contracts are required. \n\nA part of this solution is the `Curator`. The `Curator` receives assets from the Collector / Treasury Contract, swaps (or deposits) assets and sends the newly received asset to another address. The `Curator` is intended for solely exchanging assets and not holding assets. \n\nThe first iteration of the `Curator` is to be deployed on Ethereum and then later introduced to other networks. On Ethereum, the `Curator` is to interact with CoW Swap, Lido Protocol, and Rocket Pool contracts. \n\nTo limit the surface area of the contract, an `AllowList` will define which contracts the `Curator`can be interacted with. The `ShortExecutor` must first add each contract address to the `AllowList`. \n\nIt is possible to assign the `curatorRole()` to a specified wallet address, Treasury Manager. The `curatorRole` can then only interact with contract on the `AllowList` set by governance. The `AllowList` eliminates the risk of the `Curator` interacting with a malicious contract or running away with the DAO's funds. The intent is to implement the highest heirarchy of control.\n\nFor future deployments of the `Curator` on other networks, the aggregator protocol used to swap assets with MEV protection does so over a lengthy time horizon. This prevents any further steps performed by the same AIP submission. In these instances the `curatorRole` offers more flexibility and reduces the AIP overhead.\n\nEach Curator deployment will contain different functionality tailored to that network and Aave DAO's needs. As a result, each deployment will be presented to Aave DAO as an [ARFC] proposal for the community to discuss and vote on. \n\nDuring the intial deployment on Ethereum, @Llamaxyz advocates for using the `ShortExecutor` to perform all the necessary transactions. The `curatorRole` can be assigned at a later date. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe Ethereum Curator will provide the following functionality to Aave Protocol: \n\n1. Receive assets from the Treasury (assets must be pushed)\n2. Redeem aTokens for underlying spanning Aave v1, v2, and v3\n3. Swap assets via CoW Swap with MEV protection and using Milkman\n4. No reentrant \n5. Cancel trade\n6. Rescue tokens\n7. allowTokens(address[] tokens) onlyExecutorOrAllowedCaller\n8. Deposit ETH into Lido Finance Protocol to receive stETH\n9. Wrap stETH to create wstETH\n10. Deposit ETH into Rocket Pool's contract to receive rETH\n11. Transfer assets to Treasury\n12. Call a function to deposit assets in Aave v3 on behalf of Treasury\n13. Allow-list tokens/contracts that can be interacted with\n14. Allow-list Executor and approved multisig, CuratorRole().\n\nThe Curator will contain an `AllowList` defining which contracts the contract can interact with. The `AllowList` can only be updated by Aave Governance via the `ShortExecutor`. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance.\n\nThe [ARFC] publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].\n\n# Disclosure\n\n@llamaxyz is a service provider to Aave DAO.
