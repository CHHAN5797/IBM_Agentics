As we onboard various LRTs, our goal is to promote the use of wstETH as a debt asset to enhance the returns of the wstETH/wETH yield strategy.\n\nBy increasing the Uoptimal of the wstETH reserve, we can significantly improve its capital efficiency. Strategists using LRTs as collateral and borrowing wstETH to generate yield will be able to borrow a larger portion of the wstETH that in turn generates a wstETH deposit yield.\n\nThe wstETH deposit yield will offset the wETH borrowing costs. Depending on market conditions, this could lead to a future proposal that fine-tunes the wETH and wstETH Slope1 parameters to balance the wETH deposit yield, revenue, and the performance of the wstETH/ETH yield strategy. Optimizing these parameters is expected to significantly reduce the payback period on the Lido instance and improve the DAO’s overall return on investment.\n\nA separate proposal will provide details on the new eMode configurations being introduced to the Lido instance of Aave v3. This publication focuses specifically on optimizing the wstETH Uoptimal to improve capital efficiency in preparation for LRT onboarding.\n\nWhilst several teams are expected to offer incentives for strategies involving LRT collateral and wstETH debt, general market conditions are not sufficiently buoyant to support retaining the current 3.50% Slope1 parameter.\n\nWhilst we expect strong demand for wstETH debt from users wanting to leverage farm LRT point incentives. Our research indicates sufficient demand emerges when the Slope1 is within the 2.00% to 2.50% range. As a result, this publication proposes reducing the Slope1 from 3.50% to 2.25%.\n\nBy revising the Slope1 and Uoptimal configuration for the wstETH reserve, we expect LRT deposits to drive significant AUM growth for the Lido instance.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe Lido instance wstETH Slope1 and Uoptimal are to be revised as follows:\n\n|Description|Current|Proposed| Change   |\n| --------- | ----- | ------ | -------- |\n|Slope1     | 3.50% |   2.25%|  -1.25%  |\n|Uopitimal  | 45.00%|  80.00%|  35.00%  |\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will implement proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Prime Instance - wstETH Borrow Rate + rsETH Supply Cap Update \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-01-14\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes reducing the wstETH Slope1 and increasing the rsETH Supply Cap.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Prime instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum has experienced significant growth since its launch in Q3 2024, attracting over $2 billion in user deposits.\n\nTo support continued growth, this proposal suggests lowering the wstETH Slope1 parameter to align the borrow rate with market conditions. Based on feedback from the Renzo and Kelp teams, this adjustment is expected to drive an additional $300 million in user deposits to the Prime instance.\n\nExpected Benefits of Reducing the Slope1 Parameter:\n\n* ~72% increase in LRT deposits.\n* ~50% increase in the wstETH Deposit Rate to 60 bps.\n* ~50% increase in wstETH Borrow Rate fee generation.\n* ~35% increase in the native wETH Deposit Rate.\n\nLowering the Slope1 parameter will encourage new LRT deposits, boosting the LRT/LST yield-generating strategy, which is projected to outperform the LST/wETH strategy. With LRT deposit incentives, this strategy further enhances Prime's appeal.\n\nAs utilisation of wETH reserves across Core, Spark, and Prime approaches Uoptimal, the Prime instance of Aave v3 offers the highest native yield for LST/wETH yield strategies. The improved wstETH deposit rate solidifies Prime's competitive position in the market.\n\n## rsETH Supply Cap\n\nrsETH has shown strong growth on the Core instance of Aave v3, while the Prime market has yet to attract rsETH deposits due to the lower wstETH Borrow Rate on Core and a small supply cap.\n\nLowering the wstETH Borrow Rate on Prime would make borrowing wstETH more attractive. Feedback from the Kelp team suggests strong demand for rsETH beyond the current supply cap's capacity.\n\nTo support leveraged LRT/LST yield strategies, this proposal recommends a significant increase to the rsETH supply cap, enabling larger deposits to scale effectively, optimize returns, and reduce reliance on incentives. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters on the Prime instance are to be adjusted.\n\n**wstETH Reserve**\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n|  ---    | :---:       | :---:        |\n|Uoptimal | 90.00%      | 90.00%       |\n|Base     | 0.00%       | 0.00%        |\n|Slope1   | 1.75%       | 0.75%        |\n|Slope2   | 85.00%      | 85.00%       |\n\n**rsETH Supply Cap**\n\n| Parameter |Current Value|Proposed Value|\n|  :-----    | :---:       | :---:        |\n|Supply Cap | 10,000      | 65,000       |\n\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

GHO is to be onboarded as a borrow-only asset, similar to the current configurations of USDC and USDS.\n\n## Deploy GHO from Treasury\n\nFrom observing the USDC reserve on the Lido instance, it is apparent that GHO would benefit from some initial liquidity. With passive GHO held in the Treasury, this publication proposes depositing available GHO into the new Reserve. With the GHO expected to earn a yield the DAO will benefit from a new revenue source.\n\nA separate proposal will recommend minting and depositing GHO into the new reserve via a new Facilitator on Ethereum to futher help bootstrap the reserve. The addition of sUSDe to the Lido instance is expected to provide strong demand for stablecoin debt.\n\n## Migrate Service Provider Streams\n\nWith the GHO being deployed into Lido, several Aave DAO service provider streams are to be amended to draw GHO from Lido instance. \n\n* Chaos Labs;\n* Aave Labs;\n* LlamaRisk; and,\n* Aave Chan Initiative.\n\nWhen the AIP is submitted, new streams will be created to replace the streams being cancelled. With several streams are soon to expire during December, these streams are not migrated to Lido instance and sufficient GHO will remain in the treasury to facilitate payment to these teams.\n\nWithin this publication, the Aave Grants DAO GHO Allowance is to be cancelled. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below details the parameter configuration of the GHO Reserve on the Lido instance of Aave v3.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled| No |\n|Supply Cap | 20M|\n|Borrow Cap | 2.5M|\n|Debt Ceiling| - |\n|LTV| - |\n|LT| - |\n|Liquidation Bonus| - |\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n|Variable Base| 4.50% |\n|Variable Slope1| 3.00% |\n|Variable Slope2| 50.00% |\n|Uoptimal| 92.00% |\n|Reserve Factor| 10.00% |\n|Flashloanable | Yes |\n|Siloed Borrowing | No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n\nThe below table shows the GHO balance at time of writing for reference only:\n\n| Treasury Asset | Holding      |\n| -------------- | :----------: |\n| GHO            | [7,295,678.65](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) |\n\nNote: The September funding update is to acquire GHO and transfer 5M GHO to Arbitrum to be deployed into the GHO reserve to earn yield.\n\nSufficient GHO shall remain in the Treasury to support streams with a 2024 expiry date, with the balance to be deposited into the Lido instance of Aave v3.

With the introduction of the facilitator, the Aave DAO is expected to be an early GHO liquidity provider with GHO from the Treasury and newly minted GHO being deposited into the reserve. \n\nIn the near future, a proposal to onboard sUSDe to Lido instance will be presented on the governance forum. Onboarding sUSDe is expected to drive significant demand for stablecoins on the Lido instance. A combination of making available liquidity, having an appropriate Borrow Rate and Borrow Cap enables the GHO Stewards to balance growing GHO's circulating supply and peg resilience. By providing liquidity on the Lido instance, the Aave DAO shall provid the initial bootstrapping liquidity in a very cost efficient manner and in doing so, enahnce the DAO's revenue generated from the Lido instance. GHO holders will be able to deposit GHO to earn the deposit yield whilst benefit from small than otherwise concentration risk within the reserve due to the DAO providing the bootstrapping liquidity.\n\nWith strong demand for GHO using wstETH as collateral resulting in 23.7% of GHO supply sourced from the Main market being backed by wstETH, this demonstrates that users actively seek to benefit from the capital efficiency of using an LST as collateral. Deploying additional GHO into the Lido instance is expected to further encourage this positive behavior, reinforcing the appeal of wstETH as a reliable, yield-bearing collateral for GHO.\n\n![chart illustration (4)|1920x1498](upload://qIys1ADMWsNuiamV1PvLDkwZZff.jpeg)\n\n# Specification\n\n![tokenlogic illustration 1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRhLcIZkx.png)\n\nThe below table details the amount of GHO to be Minted by the Facilitator to be deposited into Lido instance upon, or shortly after, listing GHO. This is to be implemented via two AIP submissions and contain any required Supply Cap increase to facilitate the Aave DAO depositing GHO into the reserve. \n\n| Parameter |   Value    | \n| -------   | :-------:  |\n| Mint      |  10M Units | \n\nThe GHO Stewards are responsible for determining how much and when to mint GHO that is to be deposited into the Lido instance of Aave v3. \n\nFuture proposals shall use the fast track, Direct-to-AIP, process for implementing GHO Steward proposed amendments. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "> 2025-03-10: This post was edited to reflect @LlamaRisk and @ChaosLabs parameters recommendations. When they differ, the most conservative one was selected.\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes changes in the Gnosis Chain instance to improve the capital efficiency of USDC.e and sDAI assets by promoting changes on its parametrisation.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Gnosis Chain’s DeFi landscape has evolved considerably since these assets were first introduced. With a vibrant ecosystem now in place, it’s time to enhance capital efficiency, reduce capital fragmentation, and create useful debt vs no risk looping within the Aave GC instance to attract more capital and increase utilisation.\n\n**USDC to USDC.e Transition:**\n\nGnosis Chain is committed to making USDC.e (the version that aligns with Circle’s standards) the defacto version of this stablecoin within its ecosystem, by accelerating the transition from USDC and making it the major market within Aave’s GC instance (replacing xDAI). To incentivise this migration and accommodate increased capital inflows, we propose the following adjustments for USDC.e:\n\n* Supply and Borrowing Cap Increase: Enacted via the Risk Steward.\n* Emode Creation: Establish an Emode pairing between USDC.e and sDAI, similar to the existing sDAI/EURe Emode.\n\nThose changes will incentivise looping strategies with USDC.e similar to those with EURe/xDAI.\n\nTo further promote the transition to USDC.e, we propose reducing the LTV factor for USDC. This measure will prevent the initiation of new borrowings using USDC, thus encouraging users to adopt USDC.e.\n\n**sDAI Borrowability**\n\nThis proposal also asks to make sDAI a borrowable asset. There is little justification for depositing xDAI into Aave on Gnosis, as sDAI offers the same risk profile. The optimal configuration, then, would be to phase out xDAI in favour of sDAI (this will be presented in a future proposal). sDAI becoming borrowable ensures a more efficient and market-driven borrowing system on the platform.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe tables below show the current and proposed parameters for each asset. A subsequent AIP will be submitted to implement these changes upon implementing this proposal.\n\n* USDC.e\n\n|Parameters|Current|Proposed|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|Yes|Yes|\n|Enable Borrow|Yes|Yes|\n|Enable Collateral|Yes|Yes|\n|Loan To Value (LTV)|75%|75%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|78%|78%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Supply Cap|10M|10M|\n|Borrow Cap|9M|9M|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Optimal|90%|90%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|9.5%|9.5%|\n|Slope2|40%|40%|\n|Emode|No|Yes|\n\n* Create sDAI/USDC.e E-mode\n\n|Parameters|Value|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Asset|sDAI|USDC.e|\n|Collateral|Yes|No|\n|Borrowable|No|Yes|\n|Max LTV|90%|90%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|92%||\n|Liquidation Bonus|4%||\n\n* USDC\n\n|Parameters|Current|Proposed|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Supply Cap|11m|2m|\n|Borrow Cap|11m|2.5m|\n|Reserve Factor|25%|40%|\n|LTV|75%|65%|\n\n* sDAI\n\n|Parameters|Current|Proposed|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|Yes|Yes|\n|Enable Borrow|Yes|Yes|\n|Enable Collateral|Yes|Yes|\n|Loan To Value (LTV)|75%|75%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|78%|78%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|20%|20%|\n|Supply Cap|48M|48M|\n|Borrow Cap|0|4M|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Optimal|90%|90%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|4%|4%|\n|Slope2|75%|20%|\n|Emode|No|Yes|\n\n# Disclosure\n\nkarpatkey has not received payment for this proposal. karpatkey is a delegate within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.
