        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the funding of the Balancer Foundation for year three.\n\nAs a recap, the Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work in a decentralized environment, and supports resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate. It allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts, and is able to take certain actions that a DAO is unable to perform on its own behalf.\n\nThe Foundation and its operating subsidiary (Balancer OpCo Limited) act as facilitators of the Balancer Ecosystem. This governance structure, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, the front-end team or other technology providers.\n\nIn short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the DAO and part of the DAO’s governance within the structure of the traditional business world.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.\n\n# Specification - Foundation expenses and reserves\n\nThe budget identified for the Foundation is line-item specific and includes very few estimates. The Foundation has, however, assisted in achieving meaningful savings elsewhere in the ecosystem, mainly by optimizing costs across many different service providers.\n\nThe Foundation’s independent Cayman director reviewed these projections in comparison with a number of foundations similar portfolio to the Balancer Foundation, and sees the Balancer Foundation achieving a material cost saving overall with its proposed figures.\n\nThis proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2024 running through March 2025. This proposal does not request any change to the self-insurance reserve, currently covered by the approval of [BIP-198](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409).\n\n## Foundation Expenses\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, and introduces a few changes to our Cayman/BVI structure without compromising our footprint in these jurisdictions, significantly reducing our USDC burn.\n\nThe current CEO (Tristan Relly) has given notice and the Foundation Board, with support from team leaders in the Ecosystem-Council, has identified @Danko8383 to perform the operational and administrative roles for both the Foundation and Balancer OpCo, deprecating the “CEO” title.\n\nDanko is a seasoned Balancer community member, part of the Balancer Maxis and has been a Director on the Foundation Board since Dec 2022. From Q2 and beyond, this proposal would also see other daily operational duties of the DAO (currently held from within the Maxis) move into the Foundation/OpCo setup, reallocating this scope of work (see more on the Maxis funding proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2024/5625));\n\nIn order to replace Tristan Relly’s signing authority in the Cayman Islands, the board has carried out discussions with independent directors based in the Cayman Islands, and would like to propose that the Foundation retain the services of an additional professional director provided by Leeward Management Limited (“Leeward”) that is being offered at a competitive price. The budget includes an element of operational and legal support for the Foundation on a monthly basis. Leeward and their personnel are drawn from recognized industry professions, are experienced in governance and compliance matters for Cayman Islands foundation companies, and act for many leading projects and some of the largest DAOs. This particular candidate has a legal background that will be useful to the Foundation well in reviewing legal contracts.\n\nThe Foundation Board proposes that the appointment is effective immediately on the conclusion of voting should the proposal pass. According to article 5.3 of Balancer’s Foundation Articles of Association: “The Token Holders have the power, by Governance Resolution, to appoint or remove Directors.”\n\nBoard meetings held on-site in the Cayman Islands are also accounted for in the budget, given last epoch’s were paid from savings. The meetings with a totality/majority of the members present are considered a great advantage for jurisdictional substance.\n\nIf approved, we propose that year three be funded from funds already held by Balancer OpCo due to savings achieved there, rather than additional funding from the DAO. If budget changes are requested, they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.\n\nThe Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, and one will see annual fees due around December/January that lead to higher funding needs in those quarters. The year two budget accounted for two years worth of annual fees and professional director's fees due to the timing of payments. That was a one-off and now the budget aligns with those payments once a year.\n\n \n![bip-566-1.png](ipfs://bafybeih7eugdbewp5tvybhddvtezyere76nouepmyjznssklxuqrggncqm)\n    \n\n# Detail\n\nFor reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.\n\n### Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)\n\nAnnual registered office and registrar fee (US$3,207.00). These fees are due in January each year and are based on current figures, with a 10% uplift. Includes:\n\n- providing the registered office and registered agent\n- maintaining the statutory registers\n- preparation and submission of annual returns\n- filing economic substance notifications\n- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same\n\n### Annual Secretary Fee\n\nUnder Cayman Law, a Foundation Company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). These fees are due in January each year and are based on current figures, with a 10% uplift.\n\nNeither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise (see “Legal Counsel” below).\n\n### Legal Counsel\n\nThe Foundation may seek counsel on matters of Cayman law and industry standards as they evolve. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to an additional Cayman legal team rather than the in-house service team.\n\nAny additional corporate requests (e.g. requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc) are here included as a buffer and will also be charged separately.\n\nTentatively, if the budget is available, the Foundation will seek counsel regarding MiCA developments in Europe and tax legislation, focusing on U.S. fiscal and regulatory overreach.\n\n### Governance/Supervisory Services\n\n#### Director and Supervisor Responsibilities\n\nUnder the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.\n\n“Supervisor”, for a Foundation Company, means a person, other than a member, who under the Foundation Company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.\n\nThe non-executive Director responsibilities are:\n\n* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors\n* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation\n* To work with the wider board of directors to:\n  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;\n  * set an agenda for board meetings;\n  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate\n* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate\n* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission\n* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary\n* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director\n\nThe contracted fees for these services are in line with industry standard, and less than certain providers. The fees are due in full in January each year.\n\nIn this present proposal, as presented above, the Foundation is budgeting for the appointment of a 4th Director to the board in replacement to Tristan Relly, allocating a maximum of 5 hours/mo (hourly charges incurred per hour capped), which should be sufficient for the Board needs.\n\n#### Community Board Member duties\n\nThe Directors have ultimate responsibility for the oversight of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:\n\n* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require\n\n* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;\n\n* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;\n\n* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;\n\nThe contracted fees for these services are in line with industry standard, and less than certain providers. The fees are due quarterly.\n\n#### Operational and administrative duties\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is currently responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation.\n\nFrom Q2/24, the Foundation Board has identified these responsibilities to be handed over to @Danko as a service provider for operations and administration at the direction of the board, accumulating other ecosystem-wide domains of operations, currently under the scope of the [Balancer Maxis](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420), taking the Ballers (community contributor) inside the OpCo subsidiary.\n\nThe cost-center shift will see an increase in Danko’s monthly compensation due to increased responsibilities, specially being a go-to signatory for the Foundation/OpCo while also acting behalf of the DAO, carrying a portion of his locked BAL package (1.2k BAL/quarter). Danko is a seasoned Balancer community member, having support from team leaders in the ecosystem-council to take on this responsibility (see detailed below). The changes introduced here and other restructuring proposals, account for most of the introduced cost savings to the DAO as a whole, reducing the Treasury’s burn rate.\n\nThe handover role of day-to-day management currently carried by the Foundation’s CEO (to be deprecated), includes:\n\n1. Liaising with the board on budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary\n* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, program operations, employee matters,\n* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance regarding the carrying out of the Foundation’s purpose under its Memorandum and Articles.\n\n2. Manage Finances and Service Providers\n\n* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.\n* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.\n* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord).\n* Contracts with BVI for service providers.\n* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account\n* Setting up and managing token custodian for the Foundation\n* As directed, overseeing vendors as needed.\n\n3. Compliance\n\n* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters.\n\n4. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.\n\nUnder the Balancer Maxis, Danko is carrying the following domains and tasks with the assistance of the Ballers:\n\n5. Community Engagement\n\n* Managing community interactions\n* Onboarding new contributors and service providers\n* Planning ecosystem meetups and events (ONsites) and handling logistical arrangements\n* Discord user support\n* Balancer weekly report (newsletter)\n* Governance report (Twitter)\n\n6. DAO Treasury and Risk Management\n\n* Overseeing budget, payments, and financial transactions.\n* Due diligence for new service providers.\n* Risk inventory and assessment with GRC\n\n7. Outreach and Anti-Scam Oversight\n\n* Leading efforts against scam activities within the Balancer ecosystem.\n* Pen-testing of security infrastructure\n* Take down of scam sites\n* Services and subscriptions admin (Discord, Notion, etc.).\n\nSee the supplementary budget proposal for the Ballers at the Balancer OpCo [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628).\n\n## Software, hosting, admin\n\nExpenses for day to day operations, including payment processor fee (crypto credit card, off-ramp solutions, banks etc.) and accounting software for bookkeeping (Xero)\n\n# Impact on the Treasury\n\nBalancer Foundation/OpCo holds enough USDC and BAL to cover the requested funding. This was saved due to the reduction in spend achieved by SPs v. their original budgets. For that reason, no token transfer is required from the DAO for this proposal.\n\nThe table below summarizes where costs were previously budgeted, and where they are now being proposed. In addition, the changes proposed by the restructuring will introduce $76,716 USD annualized net savings to the DAO (based on current projections):\n\n \n![bip-566-2.png](ipfs://bafkreigrwznk3blqr7kaqwwfuwcyt7kwwzgabfl4a55tejcjko5jmifnry)\n    \n\n## ETH Address to Receive Funds:\n\nNot necessary as this proposal can be covered by funds currently held at the Balancer OpCo.\n\n## Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this is internal / for the OpCo itself.",

        "body": "*Authored by Tristan, Sean, mkflow, and Xeonus*\n\n# Summary\n\nAs a recap, on 13 April 2022, a [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-incorporation-of-the-balancer-foundation/2989) was brought to the BalancerDAO (or the “DAO”) to incorporate the Balancer Foundation (or the “Foundation”). The Foundation provides the DAO with an additional mechanism for executing work, furthering Balancer’s decentralization goals, and building resilience across the Balancer Ecosystem.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation is a traditional legal entity that is directed by the DAO. It helps create a sustainable environment where many groups of people can participate, and provides, among others, two primary benefits:\n\nIt allows the DAO to operate at a larger scale and engage with service providers who require formal contracts. In addition, for example, it intends to establish a banking relationship to pay for certain service providers that do not accept crypto.\n\nIt encourages further decentralization for the Balancer Ecosystem because this entity, at the direction of the DAO, can leverage other teams to execute work that can further the adoption of the Balancer Protocol – for example, it could engage business development or tech providers.\n\nIn short, the Balancer Foundation acts as an agent for the BalancerDAO in the structure of the traditional business world.\n\nThe Balancer Foundation operates within a formal environment (The Foundation Companies Act) in the Cayman Islands and thus brings protection and certainty that comes with formal organizations.\n\nRunning a Foundation Company comes with certain real-world costs and financial reserve requirements. These are laid out below, first in summary and then in detail for reference.\n\n## Specification - Foundation Expenses and reserves\n\nThis proposal is created to seek funding for the Balancer Foundation for four quarters, effective April 2022 running through March 2023, and a self-insurance reserve.\n\n### Foundation Expenses\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Each quarter an update will be provided via Discourse. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision.\n\nThe Foundation’s fiscal year runs January to December, so April / May /June is the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, although it is the first quarter for which funding is requested.\n\n1. Q2 FY22 - USDC 32,941 - actual expenses incurred through the end of May 2022 and forecast for June 2022 - immediate payment requested\n2. Q3 FY22 - USDC 67,919 - for transfer 25 June 2022\n3. Q4 FY22 - USDC 67,969 - for transfer 25 September 2022\n4. Q1 FY23 - USDC 78,384 - for transfer 15 December 2022\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense line items by quarter. Descriptions for each line item are included under the “Detail” section further below.\n\n![|624x417.174903581549](upload://vPqyfiEv162ngVFJ64ipxJDv5Ii.jpeg)\n\n### Foundation Self Insurance Reserve\n\nAs part of this proposal, we are asking BalancerDAO to hold the equivalent of US$500,000 as a self-insurance reserve, earmarked for a year and to be revisited after a year. The reserve can be maintained in BAL tokens given current market conditions, but must at all times be available to the Foundation should it be needed, and must be maintained at an equivalent value of US$500,000. More on this reserve requirement can be found in the “Detail” section below.\n\nNote: the proposal is for funding at the Balancer Foundation level, it does not include funding for:\n\n1. Balancer OpCo Limited, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subsidiary and operating company that will house the front-end development team for BalancerDAO,\n2. Other third-party service providers to the BalancerDAO, such as Orb Collective and Kolektivo Labs.\n\nProposals for funding these three entities will follow separately.\n\n# ETH Address to Receive Funds: \n0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693\n\n# Detail\n\nFor reference, please see below descriptions of the individual line items.\n\n## Annual Secretary Fee\n\nUnder Cayman Law, a foundation company must at all times have a secretary who is a 'qualified person' (i.e. a person licensed or permitted under the Companies Management Act to provide company management services). The secretary has a duty to ensure that the company complies with applicable Cayman Islands legislation governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing.\n\nNeither the secretary fee nor the registered office fee includes the preparation of minutes and resolutions. The Foundation will prepare these for typical matters but might seek assistance from Campbells if complex matters arise.\n\nThese fees are due in January each year.\n\n## Registered Office and Registrar of Companies fees (via Campbells Corporate Services Cayman)\n\nAnnual registered office and registrar fee – US$2,915.12, which consists of:\n\n- Registered Office fee of US$ 1,495.00\n\n- Beneficial Ownership Reporting and Register Maintenance Fee of US$225.00\n\n- Economic Substance Notification Fee of US$125.00\n\n- Registrar Annual Return Fee of US$853.66\n\n- Supplementary Registered Office License Fee of US$91.46\n\n- Sundry Disbursements of US$125.00\n\nIncludes:\n\n- providing the registered office and registered agent\n\n- maintaining the statutory registers\n\n- preparation and submission of annual returns\n\n- filing economic substance notifications\n\n- maintaining the UBO register and reporting on the same\n\nThese fees are due in January each year.\n\n## Additional Campbells Corporate Services costs\n\nAny legal advice that may be requested from time to time will be charged on a time spent basis. Any additional corporate requests (for example, requests for certificates, certified documents, updates to registers, filing changes, mail forward, etc – these are all in addition to the annual fees) will also be charged separately.\n\n## Governance/Supervisory Services\n\n### Non-Executive Director and Supervisor Responsibilities\n\nUnder the Foundation Companies Act, 2017 and the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Balancer Foundation, the Foundation is required at all times to have at least one Supervisor who is able and willing to supervise the management of the Foundation Company.\n\n“Supervisor”, for a foundation company, means a person, other than a member, who under the foundation company’s constitution has an unconditional right to attend and vote at general meetings, whether or not the person has supervisory powers or duties.\n\nThe non-executive director responsibilities are:\n\n* To act as the Chairperson for the purposes of board meetings (to the extent the other board members do not wish to have this rotated to them), to delegate matters to the company secretary, and to ensure appropriate board packs and documents are prepared by the secretary or relevant Foundation officers or employees or contractors\n* To act as the Supervisor for the Foundation and to carry out the tasks of the Supervisor under the articles of association of the Foundation\n* To work with the wider board of directors to:\n  * set the direction for the foundation and its business with the board of directors;\n  * set an agenda for board meetings;\n  * further the growth of the Balancer DAO as appropriate\n* Along with other board members to select and remove directors where appropriate\n* Along with other board members, oversee efforts to support and grow the Balancer ecosystem including seeking funding and setting budgets, establishing the Foundation’s efforts to further its mission\n* Along with other board members, oversee the Foundation CEO, the Foundation and the BVI subsidiary\n* Where necessary to execute contracts and agreements for the Foundation and BVI Subsidiary with or in the stead of the executive director\n* Set the tone to involve the Balancer ecosystem in developing long-range programs to support and increase all types of contributions to Balancer projects\n* Set the tone to harmonize the ecosystem working with the board, the service providers, and projects and adjacent foundations to find opportunities to collaborate and reduce confusion.\n\n### Community Board Member duties\n\nThe Directors have ultimate responsibility for the management of the Foundation. In particular, the Director’s responsibilities will include:\n\n* complying with all reasonable requests, instructions and regulations made or given by the Board (or by any duly authorized committee thereof) and give to the Board such explanations, information, and assistance the Board may reasonably require\n\n* attending all meetings of the Board in person or by video/phone; provided that the dates of such meetings have been communicated to the Director by the Company or its corporate secretary, as applicable, with reasonable advance notice; and provided further that the Director may not be able to attend a meeting due to illness or incapacity or any other reasonable circumstances;\n\n* bringing independent judgment to bear on issues of the DAO, strategy, policy, resources, performance, and regulatory matters;\n\n* providing advice and direction on all matters affecting the Company, including, but not limited to, adherence to terms set forth in the Articles;\n\n* planning, developing, and enhancing the future strategic direction of the DAO\n\n* sharing responsibility with the other director(s) of the Company for the effective management of the Company\n\n### CEO/Management duties\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Foundation, which includes the following roles:\n\n1. Liaising with the board on all budgets, project proposals, and matters particularly as it relates to service providers including the BVI subsidiary\n\n* Reporting to the board in a timely manner on all matters of importance including financial status, funding projections, policy setting, planning, program operations, employee matters, and the long-term health of the ecosystem.\n* Providing adequate materials and analysis to assist the board in making decisions on all matters of importance.\n\n2. Manage Finances and Service Providers\n\n* Overseeing all financial management of the Foundation, including budgets for Board approval, grant, and funding administration required by either the Foundation or other supporters. Possessing thorough knowledge of all funding sources and required records.\n* Maintaining and adapting the organizational structure and systems capable of meeting the needs of the Foundation in carrying out its mission.\n* Overseeing BVI subsidiary operations including staff and logins as needed (Twitter, GitHub, Discord). Contracts with BVI for service providers.\n* Setting up and administering the Foundation’s bank account\n* Setting up and managing token custodian\n\n3. Involving the board, ecosystem participants, service provider staff as needed in developing organizational goals, a strategic plan, and projections for supporting the Balancer mission through service providers (Orb Collective Inc and BVI subsidiary) and the community.\n\n* Overseeing vendors & others involved in actively seeking software and product developments and funds as needed.\n* Ensuring that the Balancer projects delegated to service providers and the ecosystem have clear objectives that are within the scope of the resources and mission of the Foundation.\n* Overseeing the gathering, analysis, and reporting of data illustrating the work accomplished by service providers to manage performance and deliverables\n* Reviewing program evaluation results and developing and executing strategies for continual improvement.\n\n4. Compliance\n\n* Responsible for all necessary filings, responses to inquiries, management of AML Compliance vendor, and other Cayman Foundation compliance and risk-related matters\n\n5. and such other services reasonably related thereto as may be requested by the Foundation.\n\n## Legal Counsel\n\nThe Foundation may from time to time require advice on matters of Cayman law. It is hard to estimate this cost as it could vary considerably depending on the item. We have inserted a placeholder for each quarter. For clarity, this refers to the legal team rather than the corporate services team.\n\n## Self Insurance\n\nIt is typical for an organization to obtain insurance to protect itself against the legal, regulatory and operational risks, as well as to protect the directors and officers from personal liability for carrying out their duties. We have not seen reasonable insurance for organizations of this nature in the market, hence the need to self-insure.\n\nWe are asking for $500,000 based on the costs of defending Balancer in the event of a regulatory inquiry, class action or other lawsuit or vulnerability to the ecosystem. The self-insurance is based on recent DeFi matters within the last 12 months which have cost on average $100,000 monthly to defend. It is important to note, that we have excluded any reserve for payment of damages, fines, or impact on users.\n\nSince this is a reserve and not an expense, the Directors may assess in the future that a lower reserve amount becomes sufficient and propose changes to the DAO. We are asking that the DAO bookmarks these funds to hold for self-insurance.\n\n## Bank Fees\n\nThe Foundation is working to establish a bank relationship that we are advised could take approximately 6-8 weeks once the application is complete and submitted. This line item is an estimate/placeholder for monthly fees\n\n## Accounting Software\n\nEstimate for monthly software subscription fees.\n\n## Domain hosting, email document management solution\n\nMinor operating budget to cover the above and related items.",

        "body": "# Investment Policy Statement\n\n## Abstract\n\nIntroduction of an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for Balancer DAO Treasury management.\n\n## Introduction\n\nOfficially established in November 2022, as per [BIP-103](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-103-karpatkey-balancer-treasury-cu-proposal-update/3895), The Balancer DAO Treasury has grown to play a critical role in supporting the protocol’s operations, resilience, and long-term sustainability. As both the DeFi landscape and the DAO’s priorities evolve, it’s important to establish a shared framework for how Treasury assets are managed.\n\nThis IPS aligns with the ongoing [Treasury Migration Proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-dao-treasury-assets-migration/6489), which consolidates assets into the kpk-managed multisig to enhance execution and asset management, and reinforces our commitment as Treasury Managers.\n\nThis post introduces an Investment Policy Statement (IPS), developed by kpk in collaboration with Balancer DAO contributors. The IPS is designed to:\n\n1. Define and assign the responsibilities of all involved parties.\n2. Establish clear investment goals and objectives for Treasury assets.\n3. Provide guidance and limitations to the Treasury Manager in executing strategy.\n4. Ensure Treasury assets are managed according to prudent and transparent standards.\n\nOverall, the IPS aims to strike a balance: it should provide enough structure to guide day-to-day execution, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to changing DAO needs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis Investment Policy Statement (“IPS”) outlines the principles and guidelines for the effective management of the Balancer DAO Treasury (the “Treasury”). It establishes a clear understanding among DAO participants regarding the purpose, constraints, and governance structure around the Treasury, with the goal of:\n\n- Planning appropriate asset allocation and implementation of Treasury strategies.\n- Supporting informed financial planning across the DAO.\n- Establishing accountability and transparency for all involved parties.\n\nThis document also distinguishes between Treasury assets managed under the kpk mandate and those retained directly by the DAO.\n\n## Background\n\n### History of Balancer\n\nLaunched in 2020, Balancer DAO governs the Balancer Protocol, a decentralised automated market maker (AMM) designed to support flexible and efficient liquidity pools. Built on Ethereum and EVM compatible chains, Balancer enables users to both swap tokens and manage self-balancing pools with multiple tokens and customisable weights. Governance and protocol upgrades are managed by the Balancer DAO through community proposals and token voting. Further technical details can be found in the Balancer Documentation.\n\n### Purpose of Balancer DAO\n\nThe Balancer DAO community has progressively aligned around a shared mission: to develop and steward a decentralised protocol for programmable liquidity. The DAO aims to ensure the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of the Balancer ecosystem — driving innovation in AMM infrastructure and strengthening the protocol’s position in the ecosystem. Treasury assets, and any income generated by these assets, are used to fund protocol development, ecosystem grants, security initiatives, and incentive programmes that drive usage, growth, and resilience across supported networks.\n\n### History of kpk\n\nFounded in 2020, kpk is a DeFi-native treasury management organisation focused on secure, transparent, and non-custodial asset management for DAOs.\n\nkpk specialises in active deployment of DAO funds into carefully vetted DeFi strategies, combining rigorous risk management with a trust-minimised approach that preserves DAO self-custody. The team has developed proprietary monitoring tools, automated execution agents, and governance-integrated frameworks to serve some of the most prominent DAOs in the ecosystem, including Gnosis, Aave, ENS, CoW, Safe, Arbitrum, Nexus Mutual, and dYdX.\n\n### Purpose of kpk\n\nkpk empowers organisations to confidently navigate on-chain finance by securing, managing, and growing their digital assets. kpk deploys yield-bearing strategies with both world-class risk management and operational excellence.\n\nWith non-custodial management, funds always stay under the client’s control. kpk just gets the permissions needed to act on the DAO’s behalf — no assets are transferred to kpk directly for management. Roles contracts are used to define a set of pre-approved permissions that the DAO grants kpk in order to execute on their behalf. Any and all actions that are not present in these permissions contracts will not be actionable by kpk as Treasury Manager.\n\n## Purpose of the Investment Policy Statement\n\nThe Investment Policy Statement (“IPS”) has been developed by kpk in collaboration with Balancer DAO to:\n\n1. Clarify the roles and responsibilities of all relevant parties.\n2. Provide a shared understanding of the objectives and intended outcomes for the DAO’s Treasury assets.\n3. Offer direction and guardrails for the Treasury Manager in executing investment activities.\n4. Set a reference point for assessing the Treasury Manager’s performance.\n5. Ensure Treasury assets are managed in line with sound, responsible practices.\n\n## Governance and Oversight\n\n### Responsibilities of Balancer DAO\n\nThe responsibilities of Balancer DAO include, but are not limited to:\n\n- **Establishing Objectives**: Defining the investment goals, risk tolerance, liquidity targets, and any relevant operational or strategic constraints.\n- **Approving the IPS**: Formally approving this document and any future revisions through governance processes.\n- **Oversight and Review**: Reviewing the Treasury’s alignment with objectives and constraints outlined in this IPS. This includes evaluating strategy fit, operational soundness, and alignment with the DAO’s evolving needs.\n- **Communication**: Informing the Treasury Manager of any significant changes to DAO priorities, mandates, or financial conditions that could affect treasury management.\n- **Reviewing and Revising the IPS**: Periodically reviewing the IPS and revising it as necessary in response to changes in the DAO’s circumstances or broader market context.\n\nIPS review is expected to occur on an annual basis, or sooner if material changes arise. The Balancer DAO community is responsible for initiating and approving changes through its governance process (e.g., Snapshot proposals and forum discussions).\n\n### Responsibilities of the Treasury Manager\n\nkpk acts as Balancer DAO’s Treasury Manager, as designated by [BIP-103]. Within this role, kpk is responsible for:\n\n- **Strategy Implementation**: Executing treasury strategies in accordance with this IPS and DAO-approved permissions.\n- **Deployment**: Actively managing capital in risk-adjusted, yield-generating DeFi strategies.\n- **Reporting**: Providing regular updates, including monthly financial reports and presentations, and supporting documentation for governance discussions.\n- **Risk Management**: Continuously monitoring exposure across market, counterparty, smart contract, liquidity, and governance risks. Ensuring response mechanisms are in place to reduce risk.\n- **Communication**: Maintaining an open line of communication with the DAO and proactively disclosing material changes or considerations that may impact the treasury.\n- **Support**: Assisting in ad hoc financial projects, partnership evaluations, or strategy reviews relevant to treasury health and ecosystem alignment.\n\nAll actions are executed within the scope of pre-approved roles and permissions assigned by the DAO. kpk cannot take any action not explicitly allowed by the DAO’s permissions system.\n\n## Treasury Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Balancer DAO’s Treasury is to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the DAO, while maintaining operational flexibility and capital preservation. The Treasury aims to support the DAO’s current and future needs without the need to liquidate core DAO-native assets. As the Treasury grows over time, it is expected that investment returns will contribute to funding operational expenses, either partially or in full.\n\n### Investment Objectives\n\nThis objective is pursued through a conservative investment approach, with a focus on:\n\n- **Capital Preservation**: The Treasury should prioritize safeguarding principal value. Deployment should avoid unnecessary risk and be focused on stable, proven DeFi strategies. Avoiding capital loss is a core principle of the Treasury mandate.\n- **Risk-Adjusted Yield Generation**: Where appropriate, Treasury assets may be deployed to generate yield, provided the strategy meets conservative risk parameters and maintains liquidity standards. The purpose of yield is not to speculate, but to extend the life of the Treasury and reduce the need for DAO-native asset liquidations.\n- **Growth of Capital**: As the Treasury grows in size, yield generation may play an increasing role in covering DAO expenses. The long-term objective is for the Treasury to be able to partially or fully fund Balancer DAO’s operational needs through on-chain returns.\n\nThe Treasury is not expected to meet specific performance benchmarks or return targets at this time. Instead, strategic success is evaluated based on the alignment with DAO objectives, such as capital preservation, diversification, and liquidity readiness.\n\n### Risk Objectives\n\nRisk, in the context of this Investment Policy Statement, refers to the probability of the Treasury failing to meet its obligations, including operational funding needs, capital preservation, and strategic flexibility. The DAO maintains a conservative risk tolerance, placing high priority on capital preservation and steady operational continuity. ostracized strategies should avoid excessive volatility, capital loss, or dependence on speculative activity.\n\nThe following definitions and principles guide the risk management process:\n\n- **Risk Tolerance**: Balancer DAO has a conservative risk appetite. Risk-taking is acceptable only when aligned with the DAO’s core principles of sustainability, transparency, and control.\n- **Disallowed Activities**: Speculative trading or any activity with unacceptable downside risks is explicitly prohibited. Deployment is limited to strategies and venues deemed low-risk and pre-approved by governance.\n- **Risk Monitoring Categories**:\n  - **Market Risk**: Price volatility or macroeconomic trends affecting value.\n  - **Smart Contract Risk**: Vulnerabilities in protocol code.\n  - **Liquidity Risk**: Inability to convert assets quickly enough to meet operational needs.\n  - **Governance Risk**: Threats emerging from the governance processes of third-party protocols.\n  - **Operational Risk**: Execution errors, delays, or misalignments with DAO mandates.\n  - **Regulatory Risk**: Impact from evolving legal or compliance frameworks.\n\nThe Treasury Manager is expected to continuously monitor these risk vectors and maintain adequate tooling, alerting, and mitigation processes.\n\n## Investment Guidelines\n\nThe following investment guidelines are designed to ensure responsible treasury deployment, liquidity management, and operational flexibility. They reflect the DAO’s conservative risk profile and strategic intent to preserve capital while enabling stable, long-term financial sustainability.\n\n### Constraints\n\nThe Balancer DAO Treasury adheres to the following operational and risk-related constraints:\n\n- **Liquidity Target**: The Treasury aims to maintain a three-year stablecoin runway, structured across two liquidity tiers:\n  - 0–12 months: Stablecoins in highly liquid, instantly accessible venues.\n  - 12–36 months: Stablecoins deployed in longer-maturity strategies with conservative risk profiles.\n- **Deployment Limits**: To minimize protocol- or issuer-specific risk, each strategy or asset category (e.g., stablecoin deployments, ETH staking, or partner token allocations) should not allocate more than 30% of that category to a single protocol, platform, or asset.\n- **Strategy Restrictions**: Only low-risk, DAO-approved strategies may be used. Speculative trading or use of unvetted or high-risk protocols is prohibited. Strategies utilizing BAL or Balancer products require separate governance approval.\n- **Governance Permissions**: All actions must fall within the permissions framework pre-approved by the DAO via Roles Modifier contracts. Actions outside this allowlist are operationally blocked and cannot be executed by the Treasury Manager.\n\n## Asset Allocation\n\nThe Treasury may be allocated across a variety of assets and networks, with the following guiding rules:\n\n- **Approved Blockchains**:\n  - Ethereum Mainnet\n  - Gnosis Chain\n  - Arbitrum\n  - Base\n\n  Deployment to other chains requires DAO governance approval and creation of a new treasury address.\n\n- **Approved Strategy Types**:\n  - Lending and borrowing via DeFi money markets\n  - Liquidity provisioning\n  - Staking (direct or via liquid staking tokens)\n  - Cash-and-carry or basis trades without directional exposure\n  - Other strategies explicitly approved by the DAO via governance\n\n## Portfolio Rebalancing\n\n- **Rebalancing Frequency**: The Treasury will be rebalanced on a monthly basis by kpk to maintain liquidity targets and distribution alignment.\n- **Rebalancing Method**: Rebalancing transactions will be executed incrementally and in accordance with the DAO’s operational and risk constraints. Tranches, thresholds, or rotation schedules may be used based on market conditions.\n- **Initial Rebalancing**: Following IPS approval, the Treasury Manager may initiate a realignment of the portfolio to bring allocations closer to the defined liquidity targets and risk constraints, carried out with full transparency and subject to DAO oversight.\n\n## Treasury Expansion\n\nOver time, Balancer DAO may consider expanding its Treasury through new revenue sources, token conversions, or internal reallocation processes. While this IPS does not establish a fixed mechanism for treasury expansion, the following principles may guide future developments:\n\n- **Fee Integration**: The DAO may explore a model in which protocol revenues, including fees or emissions, are periodically transferred into the Treasury. This model could take inspiration from structures implemented by other DAOs, such as dYdX or ENS.\n- **Governance Approval Required**: Any expansion mechanism — whether recurring or one-time — must be proposed and approved through the DAO’s standard governance process. This includes setting thresholds, transfer schedules, and allocation destinations.\n- **Strategic Alignment**: Any treasury expansion should reinforce the DAO’s long-term sustainability, operational resilience, and financial autonomy. This includes strengthening the Treasury’s ability to fund DAO operations, support critical ecosystem functions, and increase capital flexibility.\n- **Implementation Scope**: Expansion activities may require technical and operational coordination between the Treasury Manager, DAO contributors, and core protocol entities (e.g., Balancer OpCo, Maxis). These interactions should be structured with transparency and accountability in mind.\n\n## Reporting and Performance Review\n\nTo ensure transparency and alignment with Balancer DAO’s objectives, the Treasury Manager will provide structured updates and facilitate community engagement through the following reporting mechanisms:\n\n1. **Monthly Treasury Reporting**: A monthly update will be published summarizing treasury composition, key activities, liquidity status, and any relevant strategic context. These reports may include charts, dashboards, and links to on-chain activity for verification.\n2. **Monthly Financial Reports**: kpk will deliver Financial Reports (formally known as “State of the DAO” presentations) that synthesize treasury insights with DAO-wide financial context, including budgeting, service provider tracking, and overall treasury health.\n3. **Quarterly Reviews**: Each quarter, a more in-depth assessment of treasury trends, strategic decisions, and market context will be shared. These reviews aim to support the DAO’s ability to steer financial planning and operational strategy.\n4. **Annual Reports**: Once per year, a comprehensive overview of the Treasury will be provided, covering liquidity runway, strategy effectiveness, risk exposures, and treasury structure. This will serve as a basis for governance reflection and potential IPS revisions.\n5. **Ad Hoc Updates and Permissions Changes**: Whenever a new strategy is proposed via a Permissions Update Request (PUR), an ad hoc update will be provided to the DAO. This includes strategy rationale, operational readiness, and risk considerations.\n6. **Evaluation Criteria**: Treasury performance will be assessed primarily against alignment with DAO objectives, including:\n   - Capital preservation\n   - Stable and diversified liquidity structure\n   - Operational readiness and risk mitigation\n   - Transparency in reporting and execution\n\nThe DAO reserves the right to reassess the Treasury Manager’s mandate at any time through its governance process, based on evolving priorities, ecosystem conditions, or organizational structure.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1073\n\nAuthored by: @0xDanko \n\n## Service Provider / Organisation Name & Overview:\n\nBalancer OpCo Limited (“OpCo”) is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of the Balancer Foundation. It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (a) Administrative and Operational; and (b) Product Development. This proposal deals with the Administrative and Operational (Admin & Ops) element of the OpCo. The Product Development element of OpCo is dealt with in a separate proposal [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-565-fund-opco-product-team-april-sept/5617).\n\n### Administrative & Operations\n\nServing as the operating entity with which third-party Service Providers to the Balancer DAO will contract, submit invoices to, and from which they will be paid whether that be in fiat or in tokens. This role is integral to the decentralized operations of the Balancer ecosystem. In practice, it helps the DAO achieve its goals, supporting the healthy long term functioning of the Balancer Protocol.\n\nThe Balancer OpCo will operate under the direction of the Balancer Foundation, which will oversee / have responsibility for governance, corporate administration and operations. This includes hosting and managing software subscriptions and login credentials for certain ecosystem-wide platforms and social media accounts. It also hosts an in-house counselor for Governance, Legal and Compliance (GRC) that serves the [Ecosystem Council](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-198-creation-of-ecosystem-council-and-amended-self-insurance-fund/4409). \n\nAs a reminder, the Foundation and OpCo operate under the governance of the DAO. The community should expect to see on this budget a higher number overall, mainly due to the moving from other allocations in past epochs to this BIP: either because they are essential protocol infrascruture costs or ecosystem-wide costs, not related to a single service/entity.\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:** 522,168 USDC + 12,000 BAL (12mo)\n\nTwelve Months (Year 3) - July 2024 (Q3 FY24) through June 2024 (Q2 FY25) divided into four quarters.\n\nThe summary below reflects the proposed budget for these four quarters, to be sent in quarterly payments from the DAO. Updates on each epoch will be given according to DAO’s accountability guidelines. If budget changes are requested they will go to a snapshot vote. If no changes are requested, this proposal will serve as the governing decision. Any unspent amounts at the end of the period will either be returned to the Balancer Treasury, or offset against the next period’s funding proposal or other SPs.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter, followed by descriptions of their make-up (*editted for a more granular view*).\n\n \n![opco1.png](ipfs://bafybeibhx53gq3at2cautk3rxg5uoa7ghli2r7mikg5ozqe2hqc3qlxe7u)\n    \n\n**Requests for USDC transfers:**\n\nThe OpCo and its parent Foundation company did not request any transfers since its initial setup, funding its operations with savings due to [reduction in spend](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-foundation-and-balancer-opco-cost-update-to-the-balancer-community-march-2023/4556) achieved in Year 1. *Final numbers for Year 2 are to be presented in due time during Q3.* We propose that 522,168 USDC funding for OpCo to be drawn from DAO Treasury, which are estimated to cover the twelve months of the OpCo budget based on current information.\n\n**Request for BAL transfer:**\n\nAdditionally, OpCo requests 12,000 BAL to be allocated in Year 3 towards People Costs (Admin & Ops) to fund Ballers and other user support groups, with no transfers being required at the moment.\n\n**Impact on the Treasury:**\n\nThe Treasury currently holds [~5,7M in stablecoins](https://balancer.defilytica.com/#/treasury). Funding this proposal for the next twelve months would cost around ~9,7% of current Treasury stablecoin reserves (not including the impact of projected revenue during the period).\n\n**Cost breakdown:**\n\n* Administrative costs forecast at 38,750 USDC for the BVI structure of Registered Office/Agent, Registrar of Companies fees, annual compliance services, ongoing legal regulatory expenses (including establishment of new bank accounts, if needed), bank fees, gas fees; Directors’ and Officers’ insurance USDC 20,000 (estimate);\n\n* GRC services (126,000 USDC) will be focused on protecting the resiliency, and facilitating the growth, of the ecosystem through the Council members (and major SPs). GRC efforts will protect Balancer by focusing on regulatory developments as they relate to the current structure and, at the ready, to help respond to third party inquiries, managing regulatory risks through disclosures, issue handling, governance and legal agreement review. GRC services will be aligned with ecosystem objectives to proactively protect against potential threats from legal/regulatory changes. GRC will also include keeping the Ecosystem Council current on matters of regulatory changes and sentiment, monitoring the GRC program including review of marketing/comms, conflicts of interest, VASP, sanctions and exemptions/exclusions from other evolving global requirements, assessment and negotiation of material contracts for disclosed council members and SPs and management of regulatory inquiries, investigations and/or litigation and strategy for Ecosystem Council with external counsel as needed. For more info, please refer to [Year 2 proposal here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-349-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-administrative-and-operational-for-year-2-fy23-q3-through-fy24-q2/4923#service-provider-organisation-name-overview-1).\n\n* Bookkeeping and accounting services estimated at 30,000 USDC for the year, including a Cayman-based accounting firm and professional bookkeeper. This also is a very low budget given industry comparables For more information, see Foundation budget and changes made [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-566-year-three-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/5627).\n\n* The Ballers [have moved](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-567-opco-admin-ops-supplementary-budget-for-q2-2024/5628) from the Balancer Maxis umbrella to live under OpCo, bringing more clarity to user support and attending to community queries, mainly through Discord. This change (budget at 48,000 USDC + 12,000 BAL) carried some savings since Q2’24. The group is running leaner, carrying 1.5 FTE, costing 3,000 USDC+300 BAL in salaries per month, but we'd like to leave room to onboard more people as we approach v3, higher usage and bull market.\n\n* Business and Community Service Providers (forecast at 50,838 USDC) consist in a set of software subscriptions and diverse service providers, currently being utilized by one or multiple DAO SPs for coordination, i.e. Google Workspace, Notion, Twitter, Slack etc.\n\n* Network and Protocol Infrastructure services (forecast at 238,580 USD) is the heavy part of the budget. This was a line item moved from OpCo’s Product budget, being it essential to the core functionality of the protocol and surrounding infrastructure, i.e. API and RFC providers, DNS server, etc. This high increase is expected anticipating the launch of v3 and usage (Our highest allocation is on AWS for API, currently at $12,000/mo, which is a climbing expenditure), but the teams will be actively monitoring and searching for cost-effective alternatives whenever possible/available, likely being able to revisit these costs in 6mo.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:**\n0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693\n\n**Link to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):**\nNot applicable\n\n### Technical Specifications\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the OpCo Multi-sig `0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693` as recipient and amount as 522168 as `522168000000`.",
