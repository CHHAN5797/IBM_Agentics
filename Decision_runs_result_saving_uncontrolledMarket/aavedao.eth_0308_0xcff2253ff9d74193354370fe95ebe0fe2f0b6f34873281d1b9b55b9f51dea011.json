While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future recommendations and cases of significant market changes.\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing SNX as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0x09d86d566092bec46d449e72087ee788937599d2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x09d86d566092bec46d449e72087ee788937599d2) - borrowing $1.81M in stables (USDC and USDT) against his 1.4M SNX collateral, accounting for nearly 73% of the debt ceiling.

The user's current health score is 2.73.\n\n\n### MKR\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum set at $8.5M, has reached 99% utilization.\n\nGiven current market conditions our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling to $12M.\n\nThere are currently four major users using MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum, utilizing 87.5% of the debt ceiling. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future recommendations and cases of significant market changes\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\n1.

While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0) -  borrowing $3.11M DAI against his 5,914 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 52% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2.

        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the interest rate curves for AMPL on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs per the initial [forum post by BGD a few weeks ago](https://governance.aave.com/t/ampl-problem-on-aave-v2-ethereum/15886), over the past few weeks, we have seen an abnormal exponential deviation within the AMPL market, particularly in the context of aAMPL/total supplied liquidity/vAMPL supply values. Although the exact cause of this shift is still under investigation, it appears linked to the unique aAMPL implementation. Specifically, the scaled total supply of the underlying AMPL in the market, and thus by proxy aAMPL supply, seems to rebase irrespective of the utilization rate, in addition to the high interest rates realized by the aAMPL. In the expected implementation however, suppliers and/or borrowers will proportionately receive daily AMPL rebases in accordance with the utilization of the underlying market (where utilization of 100% = zero to AMPL suppliers and 0% = only to AMPL suppliers).\n\nWith minimal withdrawals and 100% utilization rate over the last month and a half, it seems as though the correlation has only gotten stronger. Given the rampant growth in aAMPL supply whilst total supplied liquidity has stayed constant, & aAMPL withdrawals are naturally credited 1:1 with underlying AMPL, there is currently a predicament whereby current aAMPL holders cannot be paid out their effective claims on the market. The development of a fair method for distributing these claims, or any potential reimbursement strategy, will be formulated in the upcoming days and weeks, once we have a clearer understanding of the core issue. As such, given the AMPL market's frozen status since Nov 27th, 2022, and the ongoing deprecation of the market (including setting the RF to 99% on Dec 17th, 2023), suggesting a decrease in slope2 from 300% to 0% could alleviate the interest rate's impact on aAMPL supply growth, even if primarily realized by the Aave collector. This adjustment seeks to analyze the influence on the relative exponentiation within the current aAMPL supply, and would leave the 20% base rate intact.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n| Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Base | 20% | No Change |\n| Slope1 | 0% | No Change |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 0% |\n| Uoptimal | 80% | No Change |\n| Reserve Factor | 99.00% | 99.90% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market conditions and its parameters on other deployments.\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Analysis\n\nChaos Labs recommends a 15% reduction. As of October 25, seven total accounts amounting to ~$141 are at risk of liquidation following the proposed changes.\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | 65% | 50% | 141 | 8 |\n\nList of affected accounts:\n\n| Account | Total Supply (USD) | Total CRV Supplied | Total Borrows (USD) | Health | Health After Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0x9ce21324617b6b573e75d28580dcd5a88c41b4bb | 106 | 29.16 | 86.47 | 1.01 | 0.99 |\n| 0xa21fa160a63993d06daf2cb22f66b9a118a25ed4 | 97 | 200.43 | 59.14 | 1.07 | 0.83 |\n| 0xf36375ef8ef450476541f6326631cac44f9f0a49 | 58 | 40.18 | 41.22 | 1.07 | 0.99 |\n| 0xe9784ffc614fe5cc57939cc7b21cdd2cf8f61c86 | 17 | 34.88 | 10.60 | 1.09 | 0.86 |\n| 0x6c62b64c4e1a4702a41c47d5cdafc29fcba0ebad | 12 | 25.77 | 6.63 | 1.23 | 0.95 |\n| 0xdb79b400a31997ebc6816f002f2b622fe186056a | 12 | 25.57 | 6.63 | 1.22 | 0.94 |\n| 0x0906f3f07c7211bdce20d8a7cf9bdd7c3306532d | 4 | 6.7 | 2.65 | 1.14 | 0.96 |\n| 0x304481771f4922b60a759ac363da3a7da6372cc1 | 4 | 0.83 | 3.5 | 1.02 | 1.00 |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 65% | 50% | -15% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

At this time, the total circulating supply on Avalanche is 1,731 WBTC.e. A  considerable portion, nearly 67%, of the circulating supply is concentrated on Aave Avalanche V2 and V3, with ~496 and ~664 tokens, respectively. \n\nGiven the persistence of this trend, we suggest reducing exposure on Aave and proactively modifying risk parameters for the asset. This strategy aims to:\n\n1.  Avert a potential scenario where there is inadequate liquidity to facilitate liquidations in Aave deployments.\n2. Motivate new and existing users on Aave to transition to BTC.b, which has a stronger liquidity profile on Avalanche.\n\n### Limit New Supply\n\nFreeze the WBTC.e reserves on V2 and V3 Avalanche.\n\n### Reduce Capital Efficiency\n\nAdditionally, as a precautionary measure and to further reduce exposure to the asset, we recommend reducing LTs and LTV, without impacting current holders:\n\n- V3 - reduce LT to 70 % and LTV to 0.\n- V2 - reduce LT to 70% and LTV to 0.\n  - at this time, this will lead to 6 accounts totaling $15 to be liquidated.\n\n# Specification\n\n### V3 Avalanche\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |\n| WBTC.e | LTV | 70% | 0% |\n| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |\n\n### V2 Avalanche\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |\n| WBTC.e | LTV | 60% | 0% |\n| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.
