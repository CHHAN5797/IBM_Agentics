This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.\n\n## **Motivation**:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**:\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with the following assets for collateral: CAKE, BNB, BTCB, WETH, USDC, and USDT. The table below provides the suggested risk parameters for each asset.\n\n|Risk Parameter|CAKE|BNB|BTCB|WETH|USDC|USDT|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|YES|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|NO|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|NO|NO|NO|NO|YES|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|55.00%|70.00%|70.00%|80.00%|77.50%|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|61.00%|75.00%|75.00%|82.50%|80.00%|80.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|5.00%|5.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|20.00%|20.00%|15.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,800,000|42,000|115|3,300.00|20,000,000*|20,000,000*|\n|Supply Cap|5,300,000|46,000|210|6,000.00|50,000,000*|50,000,000*|\n|Debt Ceiling|$10,000,000|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Stable Borrowing|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|uOptimal|45%|45%|45%|80%|90%|80%|\n|Base|0%|0%|0%|1%|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|7%|7%|3.80%|4%|4%|\n|Slope2|300%|300%|300%|80%|60%|75%|\n\n## **Deployment Checklist:**\n\n- Risk service providers feedback ✔\n- BGD Labs [Infrastructure/technical evaluation Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bnb-chain-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/13752)  ✔ \n- Oracle recommendation ✔ ([Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=bnb-chain))\n- The graph support ✔\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance  ✔ \n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~70$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Integrate BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 BNB.\n\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.\n\nCoinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.\n\nDocs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)\n\nIts mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***\n\nAs a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.\n\nFour key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:\n\n\n**Open-source**\n\nBase is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.\n\n\n\n\n**A bridge, not an island**\n\nBase is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.\n\n\n\n**Decentralization** \n\n Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy \"to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.\n\n\n**For everyone**\n\nBase is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.\n\n \nBase has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.\n\nPlease see the list below of robust launch partners:\n\n \n![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)\n    \n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.\n\nBy enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.\n\nBase is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.\n\nIn the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.\n\nSince Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:\n\n* 2,000,000 accounts created\n* 17,000,000 transactions\n* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests\n\nIn addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers (@Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of the token.\n\n|||||||\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|**Risk Parameter**|**wETH**|**USDC**|**wstETH**|**cbETH**||\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|NO|NO||\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|YES|YES||\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES||\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A||\n|Loan To Value|N/A|82.5%|70.0%|67.0%||\n|Liquidation Threshold|80%|85%|79%|74%||\n|Liquidation Bonus|82.5%|5%|7.2%|7.5%||\n|Reserve Factor|5%|10%|15%|15%||\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|10%|10%||\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|940|1200||\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|6000|10000||\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|0|0||\n|uOptimal|45%|80%|45%|45%||\n|Base|0%|0%|0.25%|0%||\n\n\n\nBase will deploy using the [Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data), which an overview can be found [here](https://static.optimism.io/#adding-a-token-to-the-list).

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal.

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave v3 MVP deployment on Scroll mainnet\n\nAuthor: Lea - Partnerships Lead at @Scroll_zkEVM\n\nDate: 2023-05-30\n\n----\n\n### Simple Summary:\n\nProposal to deploy an Aave v3 MVP to Scroll mainnet with limited assets onboarding and conservative risk parameters in order to allow Aave to establish a strategic position in the Scroll ecosystem while limiting risk exposure.\n\n### Background:\n\nThis Temp Check proposes the deployment of a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) version of Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet. Scroll mainnet will go live beginning of August this year and intends to onboard Aave V3 as one of the first DeFi dApps in the eocsystem. Scroll is an EVM-equivalent zk-rollup with the primary goal to provide scalability to Ethereum in the most robust and secure way. We guarantee this by being open source from day 1, a strong in-house security team paired with rigorous audits, third party provers upon our mainnet genesis block and a gradual decentralization of our sequencer network.\n\n### Motivation:\nAave will be given a prominent role in the early Scroll ecosystem and will be able to establish a strategic presence early on. Aave will be in good company of 150+ projects going live shortly after mainnet launch and will be able to harness a vibrant new ecosystem that expands across the globe.\n\n### Specification:\nThe proposal will detail the deployment of Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet with three collaterals (WETH, USDC, wstETH) and one borrowable asset (USDC). We consulted Gauntlet and Chaos Labs for preliminary risk parameters and if this proposal is to pass, we will get further input on risk parameters for the listed assets at the ARFC phase.\n\n| Risk Parameter |WETH|wstETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | YES | NO | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES |\n| Emode Category | eth-correlated | eth-correlated | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 80%  | 82.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 82.5% | 85% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 5% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 15% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 80% | 45% | 90% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 4.8% | 4.8% | 4% |\n| Slope2 | 80% | 80% | 60% |\n\nTo limit risk exposure to the DAO, we commit 500,000 USD in $AAVE staked to the Aave Safety Module to provide additional security guarantees.\n\n### Disclaimer\nWe consulted both @Gauntlet and @ChaosLabs for this MVP proposal. The information provided above about preliminary risk parameters is based on public sources and previous comparable parameter proposals. It cannot be guaranteed that it is or will stay accurate. Neither Gauntlet nor Chaos Labs have been compensated by Scroll.\n\nThis TempCheck has been prepared to gauge initial feedback from the community and promote further discussion. The presented risk parameters will be finalized in the ARFC phase pending a positive outcome of the Temperature Check Snapshot\n\n### Next Steps\n**Temperature Check:** Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Scroll mainnet.\n\n**ARFC:** If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP:** If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n### Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
