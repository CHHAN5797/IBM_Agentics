        "body": "# Summary\n\nChaos Labs proposes to renew our engagement with the Aave DAO, providing our full suite of risk management products and services, covering all of Aave, including V2, V3, and GHO, across all current and future deployments.\n\nOur current annual engagement is set to end on November 7th, 2023.\n\n# Background\n\nIn November 2022, Chaos formally joined the Aave DAO as a service provider specializing in risk management and parameter optimization. This partnership began with our original [engagement to cover V3 markets](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025), followed by an [extension to cover V2 markets formally](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/139/), with an additional [engagement amendment](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-scope-and-compensation-amendment/14407) approved by the community in August 2023 to adjust the scope and compensation for the remainder of the original term. \n\nDuring this time, we have consistently demonstrated our unwavering dedication to the DAO, covering all aspects of the protocol across all deployments and providing the community with proactive risk parameter recommendations alongside reactive analyses and risk-mitigating strategies in light of significant market events. Chaos has initiated over 60 ARFCs and supported nearly 100 additional proposals and community discussions, including parameter optimization, onboarding of new assets and new deployments, deprecation of V2 and migration to V3, GHO launch, and community support during major market events.\n\nDuring our engagement, the protocol incurred minimal bad debt while facing major market events, namely the USDC depeg in early March 2023. \n\n💡 A full overview of Chaos Labs’ activities through the past year can be found in our monthly community updates [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-monthly-community-update/11174/6).\n\n## Highlighted previous work and resources\n\n### Products:\n\n- [Aave Risk Monitoring and Alerting Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/overview)\n- [Chaos Labs Asset Protection Tool](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-asset-protection-tool)\n- [Parameter Recommendations Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations)\n- [GHO Risk Monitoring Dashboard](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/GHO)\n\n### Methodologies:\n\n- [Chaos Labs’ Research](https://chaoslabs.xyz/research)\n- [Chaos Labs -

Our methodologies are rooted in an integrative approach, offering protocol robustness and protecting funds from market risks through dynamic risk parameter recommendations. We provide a holistic approach encompassing software and services to mitigate risks in volatile markets, countering economic attacks on the protocol and ensuring the secure preservation of user funds.\n\n## Scope\n\n### **Risk Parameter Optimization**\n\nDeploying our custom agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors. Chaos Labs will thoroughly analyze the ecosystem and build custom agent-based simulations. These simulations leverage protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. Thorough system analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven optimization and risk management recommendations. \n\nCoverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.\n\n**Parameter Recommendation Platform**\n\nThe Chaos Labs Parameter Recommendation Portal is designed to provide the Aave community with a comprehensive understanding of the simulation outputs and underlying data to optimize risk parameter settings. By providing a clear and intuitive interface that highlights the impact of different parameter settings on risk and return, we can foster a more informed and engaged community, facilitating ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing. \n\nIn addition to presenting the data outputs from the Chaos Simulation Engine, the Parameter Recommendation Portal offers users unparalleled access to the underlying simulation mechanics and implications, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the simulations and their results.\n\n### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWe offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health. \n\nAs part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.\n\n### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3\n\nChaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the 'Background' section. \n\nAs we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2. \n\nGiven the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.\n\n### **Protocol Growth**\n\nChaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n\nAs we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol's expansion and sustainability.\n\n### GHO\n\nFollowing the initial launch of GHO, Chaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:\n\n- **Parameter Optimization** - we will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.\n- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.\n- **Facilitator's Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - we will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.\n- **And more**\n\n### Chaos Team Support\n\nAs part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.\n\nOur team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response. In the event of any incidents or issues, our team will be on hand to provide timely and effective incident response, minimizing the potential impact on the protocol and its users.\n\n**Ongoing and Proactive Risk Management**\n\nThis includes detailed analyses of new asset onboarding, assessing the potential risks and benefits of launching in new markets and providing a thorough understanding of parameter recommendations, including qualitative data and position analysis. \n\n**Incident Response**\n\n This includes supporting various events, including liquidity changes, asset depegs, price volatilities, etc. Our team provides ongoing support in these events, including market monitoring and alerting, ad-hoc risk analysis, and recommendations on risk-mitigating actions.\n\nOur team of experts brings a wealth of experience in risk management and data analysis, enabling us to provide the insights and recommendations necessary to navigate even the most challenging market conditions. By working closely with the community, we can provide the support and guidance necessary to promote Aave’s long-term success and sustainability.\n\n## Communications:\n\n- Our team will share our recommendations and analyses through dedicated governance forum discussions, maintaining transparency and facilitating effective communication with the community.\n- We commit to providing a monthly update post, highlighting completed work and outlining our future areas of focus.\n- We are consistently available for community calls and regularly schedule check-up calls with Aave delegates. These calls primarily focus on addressing risk-related inquiries, offering insights into existing proposals, and gathering general feedback.\n\n## Terms\n\n- 12-month engagement, November 13th 2023-November 13th, 2024\n- $1.6M, streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n    - Given community preference, we suggest the full amount to be paid in GHO but are open to any composition of stables/AAVE tokens.\n\n## Specification:\n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (`0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0`) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 1,600,000 aUSDC or GHO for a 12-month duration.\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and Tashi. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, we are targeting a Snapshot vote on November 1st, 2023.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) on November 8th, 2023.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5.

        "body": "![Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 11.49.57](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rytN7ZMH6.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces @TokenLogic and @Karpatkey as the DAO’s Financial Service Provider for an initial period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 400k GHO. The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:\n\n* Treasury Management;\n* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and\n* Safety Module.\n\nThe combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Treasury Management\n\nAave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.\n\n![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI \"Chart\")\n\nIn spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.\n\n### Portfolio Volatility\n\nA significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.\n\n![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA \"Chart\")\n\n### Asset Dispersion\n\nTreasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)\n\nThe DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.\n\n### Runway\n\nAccording to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.\n\n|Category|Budget $k|Duration (mths)|Annualized Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Security¹|$1,500|6|$3,000|\n|[Risk Management](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194/8)|$1,600|12|$1,600|\n|Bug Bounty|$1,000|12|$1,000|\n|Gov.

Certora only.\n2. AGD figures based on discussions with the team.\n\nWhile there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.\n\n![|669x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Aq6xqeeq_hr2ObgV9PFBiQrn6BFRk718dJywySHO4U7jRyUXSsMDyl7CdMhdf1cGOht1143KdBZy4mEagWkrum9CBeapl2HnDnSFfRbFNaPB4-3pZH0veEu8nMoo2cAw3-uohJYNq8s8zKUn-J45spg \"Chart\")\n\nWith the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.\n\n## GHO Development\n\nAave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.\n\nAiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.\n\nWith an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).\n\n![|690x391](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7UXzX05dWaMixQmE4B-lkjHuv4-fu2jIFs8bn03_gLYG8hjpIm2mPHK4uhWVcyetMgZPUlWekoavWr1pfc43F15YuXkIZPy1r1K71mtU6WxdBl4rdzw4zMiABAUsHgRDP4d-BdkW_E-EcFgA1qArif0)\n\n![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)\n\nAs demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.\n\nFor the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:\n\n### Peg Mechanisms\n\nThere's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.\n\n### Demand\n\nThe second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.\n\n![|654x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0K9JhuF5N6ScUkxYuGisZNp4S0IQ0qfc1ZvnW59aTIzisXhXB-4w5PX_2pzyTKs9sOlZkPikzm2IPx-uC_B366JsFOyHrmVqFYdLfmef0fBEaXquwkH-f48RAzVfmM9AqARhdcJ_EIQn7IrxaMv2fU0)\n\nCurrently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.\n\n![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)\n\nIf a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.\n\nFurthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.\n\n![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)\n\nThe daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.\n\n## Why Partnering?\n\nAll of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.\n\nThere hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:\n\n* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and\n* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.\n\nThe combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.\n\n### TokenLogic\n\nWe are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.\n\nOur dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.\n\n### karpatkey\n\nkarpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.\n\nAs DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.\n\nIn addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.\n\nWe now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling\n\nWe aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s \"shortExecutor\". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n## Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;\n* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and\n* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.\n\nDo note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\nAs it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.\n\n## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee\n\nThis expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.\n  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.\n  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",

The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired. Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment, including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background.

This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Integration Review: Outline the technical details of the proposed integration. This includes specifics on how Aave’s lending and borrowing functionalities will interact with new Aave Deployment. For that, please share the result of both documentation submission and technical review, from TEMP CHECK, so community can understand the level of work, security and commitment. Avoid providing sensitive information.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for ARFC phase, that has been as well implemented in TEMP CHECK stage, to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments.\n\nTo be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not, and details\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n\nSpecification: Include the initial assets that should be available as collateral and their risk parameters in a table. These should have received input from at least one risk manager service provider.\n\nDeployment Checklist: New deployments must have all of the following completed prior to posting an ARFC.\n\n- Risk service providers feedback\n- BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation\n- Oracle recommendation\n- The graph support\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nStatement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nRefine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\nIf consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\nIf consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 on the new chain.\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\n# Next Steps\n- Community Engagement: Engage with the Aave community to gather feedback on the proposed framework for new Aave v3 deployments.\n- ARFC Snapshot: If community sentiment is favorable, initiate an ARFC snapshot to gauge official support for the framework.\n- Implementation: Since this is a governance framework ARFC, if it passes snapshot, it will be implemented as the framework standard for new chain deployments going forward.\n# Disclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Updated Aave Grants Continuation Proposal \nAuthor: @0xmigi & Bill\nCreated: 2023-11-14\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nAn opportunity to continue Aave Grants DAO (AGD) for 6 months by preserving the current AGD treasury holdings and increasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.\n\nThis proposal will enable AGD to deliver and improve upon the top tier grants program the Aave ecosystem has had over the past 2+ years and continue being a gateway for new contributors to the ecosystem. AGD will fund $500,000 in developer grants per quarter, drive Aave’s culture and GHO adoption, and set the groundwork for the next chapter of the continued evolution of AGD.\n\nFigures and calculations based on asset prices have been updated from the TEMP CHECK to reflect the current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThroughout the previous proposal, AGD has:\n\nAwarded 50 new grants and made 15 payments to grantees based on milestone completion.\n\nEngaged builders and the community at five events, including four hackathons where AGD awarded a total of 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties and inspired 58 teams to hack with Aave and GHO.\n\nProliferated the ghost by hosting 1 rAAVE to strengthen Aave’s culture, bring the community together, and cultivate an ecosystem with the best contributors.\n\nExercised prudence with the treasury by decreasing the average grant size awarded by 52.8% and maintaining average reviewer compensation at ~22% of the monthly maximum budget.\n\nThis proposal outlines renewing AGD for the next 6 months by:\n\nIncreasing AGD’s GHO allowance by $328,000.\n\n# Specification\n\n*History*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia5rsf2qn7obbf2y5fs6uzqdbhz74wrvh32yys76jc5a7ks2guuay)\n    \nSince its inception in May 2021 to September 2023, AGD has awarded $4,852,753 across 249 grants.\n\nFrom the last AGD proposal in January 2023 to now, AGD has awarded 50 grants and awarded 19 Aave and GHO specific bounties across four different hackathons.\n\n*Note: All $ cost amounts are calculated at time of payment, pre/post token value fluctuations are not included unless otherwise specified. Pending payments are not included.\n\nThis is the fifth proposal for AGD:\n\n- The initial proposal launched AGD in May 2021 with $1 million of total funding over two quarters.\n\n- The second proposal was executed at the end of December 2021 and funded AGD for three months with $2 million of funding.\n\n- The third proposal was executed at the end of May 2022 and funded AGD for six months with $3 million per quarter.\n\n- The fourth proposal was executed at the end of January 2023 and funded AGD for six months with $1.625 million per quarter.\n\n*Mission*\n\nAGD is a community-led grants program that supports the growth of the Aave ecosystem by:\n\n(1) Funding innovative projects backed by strong teams with creative ideas that benefit and strengthen the Aave ecosystem through products and initiatives which:\n\nIncrease TVL or other protocol metrics\n\nExpand the capabilities of the platform and utility of Aave\n\nEmpower the community with accessible and novel insights\n\nEngage new users and enhance retention of current users\n\nGrow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity\n\nAND\n\n(2) Fostering a strong and inclusive culture around Aave. Aave’s culture leads to:\n\nAttracting and retaining the best contributors, and\n\nEncouraging the development of new and creative solutions to key areas in the Aave protocol and Aave DAO.\n\n*Metrics*\n\nGrants Provided:\n\nMay 2021 - September 2023: 249 grants worth $4,845,753\n\nJan 2023 - September 2023: 50 grants worth $885,020\n\nBreakdown of grants by category:\n\nCategory - $cumulative cost - number approved\n\nApplications and integrations - $2,664,556 - 108 grants\n\nCode audits - $82,000 - 3 grants\n\nCommittees & DAOs that serve Aave’s ecosystem - $703,780 - 18 grants\n\nCommunity (marketing and educational) - $698,550 - 52 grants\n\nDeveloper tooling - $415,000 - 13 grants\n\nEvents / Hackathons / Sponsorships - $185,000 - 14 grants\n\nOther - $294,900 - 12 grants\n\nProtocol development - $474,200 - 21 grants\n\nStatus of all Grant Projects Awarded:\n\nComplete/Live - 67.6%\n\nIn-progress - 24.8%\n\nInactive - 7.6%\n\nGrowth in Community Engagement Since Last Renewal Proposal (Jan 2023):\n\nSubstack subscribers: 1,748 → 1,805 (+ 3%)\n\nTwitter followers: 13,300 → 13,400 (+ 0.75%)\n\nTelegram members: 643 → 719 (+ 12%)\n\nLens followers: 2,828 → 8,801 (+ 211%)\n\nMirror subscribers: 169 → 546 (+ 223%)\n\nKey Stats Since Inception:\n\nParticipated in 14 hackathons, awarding $150,000 in Aave and GHO specific bounties to 58 teams.\n\nMany of these teams have continued building or contributing to Aave and GHO, including five projects that went on to receive grants.\nAchieved a Net Promoter Score, a measurement to gauge the experience of grantees, of 83 based on 77 responses.\n\nAverage response to “How likely are you to recommend AGD?” is 4.8/5.\nProcessed 1,944 applications with an average turnaround time from application submission to grant decision of 9.6 days, shrinking over time.\n\nConsistently accepted applications and awarded grants to builders:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihbznvdfekheqtlzcv5vr73dy2zmc7mgrgpxamdmgdywfcmlltrbi)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiakp7rcss6vcay3t2qtb6ltmn3svlhu2bzg3gkzx3jtcqfjlfdrze)\n    \n*Since the Last Proposal*\n\nThe community has been kept up to date with AGD’s activity in @0xmigi’s monthly governance updates, the Halfway Update, and through AGD being added to Llama’s treasury dashboard 1. The AGD website houses a running list since inception of grants awarded, event and sponsorship spend and other information.\n\nThe GHO release was an exciting launch for the Aave community and was a prioritized focus throughout AGD’s last proposal. AGD began to spread awareness about GHO’s launch and encouraged early development with GHO across the four hackathons that were sponsored. AGD also funded multiple GHO related grants and supported development with the introduction of ‘Request for Grants’, inviting projects that help to stimulate GHO’s demand and increase its utility to apply for a grant.\n\n*AGD Budget*\n\nAGD has exercised prudence with the treasury, while continuing to fund high quality builders and drive growth and experimentation in the Aave ecosystem. The current AGD treasury, including token allowances and OP, is roughly $1,435,042. Please note: despite continuing to operate and distribute grants, the dollar value of the treasury has remained relatively flat since the TEMP CHECK due to the appreciation of AAVE and OP.\n\nPart of the reduced spend is because of a reduction in the average size of grants awarded. The average grant size awarded so far in 2023 is 52.8% lower than the average grant size awarded during 2022, currently at $13,936.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihoc2iwk36ta6fqi2btkb3dsms2jteldin2w3l7w5acdxuczgon34)\n\nHere is AGD’s spend over the course of the previous proposal:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihafvtfdgespbdluqm6uv5kj2fbitjoutolsqorktozffh4tshhta)\n\n*Other Initiatives*\n\n- Increasing Grantee Accountability. There has been an influx in grantees (e.g. recently Defi Simulator, Projection Finance, and Aave Alarm) posting directly on the forum to introduce themselves, explain their grant, and to keep the community updated as they progress. Most of these posts are the result of an initiative from AGD to better increase grantee accountability and engagement with the community.\n\n- ‘Requests for Grants’ (RFGs). A pilot project has been introduced to better direct builders to apply for grants in certain high impact areas. Going forward, AGD will look to expand the list of RFGs to target high impact areas and community needs by better communicating with different contributors and encouraging anyone to make suggestions.\n\n- AGD Operations and Best Practices. Over the last two years of operations, AGD’s values and best practices have been refined and adopted. It is a priority for AGD to clearly define and share these values and best practices with the community. Here is an overview of AGD’s current process:\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiefrkqq5lsl3na4sm7hhxnwaqozsxmhvt67edyvm6sdms3iz44pke)\n\n*Grantee Highlights*\n\nSince AGD’s last proposal to September 2023, 50 new grants have been awarded and 15 follow up milestone payments have been made. Of the 50 new grants awarded, 22 are complete, live or have reached notable milestones at the time of writing. Each grant has positively impacted different aspects of the Aave ecosystem.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeic5lh6oay26aff4iuyetkhxlv6uxktk73qgcbhvbv6lhvzktvtjry)\n\nHere are some recent highlights from grantees:\n\nDullahan\n\nDesigned and launched a hub for GHO to drive adoption. Dullahan produces passive income for stkAAVE holders and provides GHO borrowers with access to reduced interest rates and reached over 3,000 AAVE in deposits a few weeks after launch.\n\nSommelier Finance\n\nEnables the creation of state-of-the-art DeFi strategies that leverage Aave V3 and GHO with the development and audit of a Aave V3 adaptor used by Sommelier strategies. As of July, their Aave V3 integration has allocated a net of $4M to Aave V3.\n\nAAVE based CIAN Strategies & Automation Tools\n\nExpands access to Aave V3 with open source vaults and advanced automation tooling, allowing strategists to generate strategies and users to easily access yield. As of August 2023, CIAN has generated $55M in TVL across Aave V2 and V3 on Polygon, Arbitrum, Ethereum Mainnet, Avalanche and Optimism via its leveraged staking strategies.\n\nOther applications include: DeFi Simulator, Aave Alarm, Projection Finance and Karma HQ’s Delegate Dashboard.\n\nIntoTheBlock Risk Radar for GHO 1\n\nHelps the community understand GHO’s activity with 20 dedicated risk indicators including peg performance, collateral distribution and whale credit history.\n\nXenophon Labs\n\nPerformed an analysis on the Safety Module proposing an increase in the slashing percentage with the intent of saving the Aave protocol ~$2.1M per year\n\nButter\n\nFacilitated an incentivized delegate initiative which kickstarted paying Aave delegates, encouraged participation in Aave governance from new community members and sparked TokenLogic to start their delegate platform.\n\nFlexible aToken Voting ScopeLift\n\nUnlocks the potential for new deposits by enabling protocols to allow users to retain voting power with tokens that are active in DeFi like Aave.\n\nAwesomeQA\n\nStreamlined the community support process with their Discord bot that automatically and quickly responds to user questions. In the past 3 months, the bot has answered over 55% of all questions, with 30% of those answers voted up by users indicating the response was very helpful.\n\n*Operational Focuses for this Proposal*\n\nThe path to a decentralized and sustainable AGD is a long journey. Here are some initiatives planned for this proposal to continue working towards an effective and sustainable AGD:\n\nFinish Establishing Legal Entity\n\nEstablishing a legal entity allows AGD to begin operating more independently and with more protection and certainty for contributors by providing a legal structure for members and the ability to operate with the traditional financial world. As it currently exists, AGD is not able to even sign a contract. Transitioning to an entity is a big step for AGD’s maturity by providing clarity and protection to contributors, along with increasing operational effectiveness.\n\nAGD is currently finalizing the process of establishing a Cayman Foundation Company. The grants process will continue to operate as it does today and there will be no noticeable changes to AGD’s current processes or operations for the community.\n\nRevamping Review Committee\n\nAGD will update the processes and structure around the review committee. One idea AGD will explore is introducing a rotating committee of community experts to serve short (3-6 months) time frames as grant reviewers. This will further involve the community in AGD while bringing expertise from different community members.\n\nAGD and Service Provider Alignment\n\nWith the increased number of Service Providers, there is a need to create better alignment between AGD and the work being done across the Aave DAO. Introducing simple activities like regular touch points would enable AGD to better (de)prioritize areas for grants based on feedback and insights from service providers. Where appropriate, AGD can also better work with service providers on helping to define the scope of related grants.\n\nMeasuring Impact\n\nAGD aims to enhance the way it measures impact from grants by further developing internal resources and working with teams such as Spindl to better track the impact effectiveness of grants.\n\nStarting with specific categories of grants like quests, AGD will better visualize activity driven by grants and gain insights into the effectiveness of different spend. Over time, AGD will extend similar tracking to other grant categories and impact metrics. This will enable the community to better track impact from grantees and empower AGD to make better review decisions.\n\n*People*\n\nAGD now has ten members.\n\nLead. Bill oversees the growth of the team, the distribution of grants, and making sure AGD meets the strategic needs of Aave DAO.\n\nReview Committee. The Review Committee is made up of:\n\nCorbin Page - Paymagic, ex-ConsenSys\n\nCalvin Chu - Impossible Finance\n\nFrancis Gowen - Flipside Crypto\n\nLawrence Mosley - Omni Analytics\n\nKakashi - Symphony\n\nAndrew Allen - Coinbase\n\nDavid Truong - x23.ai, ex-Aave Companies Genesis team dev\n\nOperations Lead. Neil has streamlined the application process, manages payments, KYC, and other administrative tasks.\n\nAnalyst. Migi is the main touch point with current and future grantees. He finds opportunities where AGD can support grantees and track the returns generated. Migi also provides monthly updates on the governance forum.\n\nCompensation:\n\nLead: $9k/month\n\nReview committee: $150/hr, capped at 10 hrs/week\n\nReviewer pay per month has averaged $1,273/month per reviewer since May 2021. We will look to modify this as part of the overall revamp of the review committee.\nAnalyst: $5k/month\n\nOperations lead: $150/hr capped at 20 hrs/month\n\nDesigner and other roles: one-off based on specific design engagements\n\nThe roles and compensation will be reviewed and iterated on in line with the focuses outlined above.\n\n*Proposed Budgets*\n\nThis proposal’s total budget will be split between a Grants Budget and an Operations Budget. In total across budgets the total ask for the next 6 months is:\n\n$328,000 increase in AGD’s GHO allowance\nThis would make AGD’s treasury, including allowances: 72.2% in stables, 18.7% in AAVE, and 9% in OP\n\n$292,000 that was previously allocated to ‘Digital Marketing’ spend has been reallocated to this budget.\n\nNotably for the stablecoin portion of the treasury, AGD has started to explore further driving GHO adoption and grantee alignment by collaborating with @TokenLogic to swap AGD’s DAI allowance with GHO. AGD will look to continue to do this with other stablecoin holdings in the future based on similar style governance proposals.\n\n*Grants Budget*\n\nCarry Forward\tAsk\tTokens for Ask\nDeveloper Grants\t$614,980\t$300,000\tStables\n$133,000\t$0\tOP\nGrants Total Budgeted Cost\t$747,980\t$300,000\t\nThe OP is based on the 100,000 OP allocated to AGD during the previous proposal.\n\nAGD will introduce a new $20k max grant size for all grants and double down on kickstarting the growth of new teams building on top of Aave and GHO.\n\n*Operations Budget*\n\nCarry Forward\tAsk\tTokens for Ask\nCompensation\t$20,150\t$300,000\tStables\nMaintenance: Tooling, subscriptions, gas reimbursements\t$526\t$20,000\tStables\nLegal Buffer\t$69,984\t$0\t\nOperations Total Budgeted Cost\t$90,660\t$320,000\t\nIncreasing the overall amount allocated to operations, especially compensation, is necessary for AGD to grow its resources and operate more independently.\n    \n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis TEMP CHECK is powered by Skywards.\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not received any form of compensation from AGD for creating this proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "The proposal to onboard LlamaRisk as a risk service provider is strongly supported by voting timeline analysis, community forum sentiment, and analogous historical proposals. LlamaRisk offers a specialized, complementary approach to existing risk management, with expertise in stablecoins, regulatory advisory, and collaboration with Chaos Labs. Similar past proposals to onboard risk service providers were successful and resulted in positive market and TVL impacts. The forum sentiment is mixed but generally leans towards support with constructive critiques, and the vote timeline shows a stable, unanimous lead for YAE. This supports the recommendation to approve the proposal for the DAO's long-term benefit.",
