        "body": "### Non-constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to get the conversation started regarding the future of the Multisig Support Services (MSS). In collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, input from MSS members, and based on conversations with key stakeholders and delegates, we are proposing to move forward by sunsetting the MSS. The multisig administration and payment processing responsibilities would be transferred to the Arbitrum Foundation, which is already deeply involved in the compliance and execution of nearly all MSS activity. MSS Signers will immediately begin the transition if this proposal passes Snapshot, and following the completion of this transition, receive final payments for their work. \n\nIf rejected, then Entropy will consider that delegates prefer to keep utilizing the MSS and will work to bring forward a proposal that restructures the MSS and a solution for the shortfall of funds.\n\n\n## Motivation & Rationale\n\nWhen the MSS was proposed in April 2024, the DAO was managing six active multisig wallets. Entropy accurately predicted that the number and complexity of DAO-affiliated multisigs would grow significantly, and today the MSS is involved with eight active multisigs, including:\n\n* MSS Payroll + R3gen\n* Delegate Incentive Program\n* Event Horizon\n* ADPC Subsidies\n* Hackathon Continuation Program\n* Stylus Sprint\n* ARDC V2\n* 2025 Events Budget\n\nThe original MSS proposal approved 600k ARB to cover the costs for R3gen’s monthly token reports and payments for the 3 chairs and 9 signers connected to the MSS. Despite an ample buffer at the time, market conditions over the last year have placed the MSS in a position where funds will run out before the end of its term, unless ARB suddenly starts performing extremely well.\n\nAs a reminder, the MSS was originally structured with 9 signers paid a fixed monthly fee of $1500 in ARB and 3 Chairs paid $2500 per month in ARB, both using the spot price at the time of payment. R3gen charges $6650 per month, paid upfront in ARB on the 1st of the month, also using USD/ARB spot price.\n\nThe MSS payroll multisig currently has 131,209.2 ARB (~$52,000, with ARB priced at ~$0.4) remaining, but with currently 2 active chairs and 8 signers, there is a total of $81,300 in commitments remaining. R3gen is owed two more payments for their June and July token reports, while the MSS members have 4 months of payment remaining (May-August) on their current term. At current prices, this would put the MSS on track to be short of funds following the July 1st payment to R3gen.\n\nIn April, Entropy, the Arbitrum Foundation, and MSS discussed potential solutions for the shortfall. Transferring the payment processing function to the Foundation was an option discussed and [shared](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/mss-for-arbitrum-communication-thread-arbitrum-multisig-support-service/26508/25?u=entropy) with the DAO by MSS chair @cattin. Following confirmation from the Foundation that they have operational bandwidth to take on such responsibilities, a partial transfer was considered by all parties, but it was deemed unfair to reduce MSS member pays due to the sustained level of risk MSS members take on by being signers. Even at $0.4, reducing the overall number of MSS members to 1 chair and 4 signers would still result in a shortfall. Another option is providing a top up of funds and beginning conversations on a restructured MSS; however, Entropy believes the best path forward is to formally wind down the MSS and recognize that the Arbitrum Foundation is better suited to take on payment responsibilities in the interim until OpCo is stood up, at which point the conversation shifts to moving the payment function to this entity.\n\nOver the MSS’ tenure, operational improvements have happened and some of the recognized frictions could likely be further negated by restructuring the MSS to less signers, as the somewhat high threshold of 7/12 or 8/12 has proven to be inherently slow and inefficient. Regardless, given that the Foundation must be involved in every multisig anyway, the contributors of this proposal feel as though it’s sensible for the DAO to formally recognize this reality and consolidate multisig operations under the Foundation’s purview for the time being.\n\nThe primary rationale for consolidating the DAO’s multisigs and payment processing under the Arbitrum Foundation instead of approving additional funds or restructuring pertains to the required compliance process and coordination between signers and the Arbitrum Foundation. The compliance requirements create a system that requires the Foundation to approve and review the recipient of nearly every payment. Whether under OpCo or the AF, consolidating the payment function under one accountable entity with the capabilities to conduct KYC/KYB is the most effective long-term solution.\n\nAdditional benefits include not only a reduction in total OpEx spending by the DAO, but also with full-time employees trained in OpSec and internal legal capacities, we believe that the funds will be safest in the hands of the Arbitrum Foundation until OpCo possesses similar capabilities. Finally, by marking the clear owner of the payroll function as the AF, responsibility for successes and failures will fall on a single party, giving the DAO greater accountability beyond the committee structure.\n\n## Specifications\n\nAfter inquiry, delegates expressed a preference to honor the agreement with R3gen and have them finish out the planned monthly token reports. To ensure that the MSS Payroll multisig has sufficient ARB to pay out R3gen for the remaining 2 reports, Entropy is proposing that the MSS wind down begins by transitioning the following multisigs to the Arbitrum Foundation with a target completion date of June 15th:\n\n* Delegate Incentive Program\n* Stylus Sprint\n* Hackathon Continuation Program\n* The DAO’s 2025 Event Budget\n* Event Horizon\n* ADPC Subsidies\n* ARDC V2\n\nFollowing the completion of this transfer, the Arbitrum Foundation will share the updated addresses for the seven initiatives being transferred in the MSS communication thread. The Arbitrum Foundation has confirmed that funds for these ongoing programs will be separated into unique wallets so that they can continue to be easily tracked. Going forward, the Arbitrum Foundation has also agreed to continue this practice for any new initiatives in order to ensure delegates and the DAO have transparency on the state and flow of funds. Additionally, the Foundation has committed to providing updates when necessary; however, delegates should expect these to be at an informal cadence.\n\nThe following multisigs will remain under the control of the MSS:\n\n* MSS Payroll and R3gen\n\nAt the passing of this proposal (June 6th), the MSS will have discretion to pay R3gen upfront for their July token report if the price of ARB is high enough to secure the avoidance of a shortfall.\n\nOnce the above-mentioned multisigs have been transferred to the Arbitrum Foundation, the MSS will complete its tenure by sending a final payment to the MSS members for their work in June. With a target completion date of June 15th, MSS members will be paid one-half of their normal monthly compensation for June. If work for the MSS extends beyond June 15th, the members will be paid a pro-rata monthly rate up until June 30th. Following these final payments, the MSS will formally dissolve, returning any remaining ARB to the DAO’s treasury and being absolved of any future payment responsibilities and risk.\n\nSimilar to the upfront payment of R3gen’s work and if necessary due to extreme changes in market conditions, MSS members will have the discretion to send payments related to June work at an earlier date to avoid a shortfall.\n\nGoing forward, the payment vertical and its structure will be left up to the Arbitrum Foundation. In the event of resource constraints, Entropy recommends to the AF that they onboard a limited number of community members to assist with multisigs for smaller programs; however, this is something that will be up to the discretion of the Foundation. If the AF chooses to do so, they will have the mandate to structure the involvement of community contributions in the payroll function as they wish.\n\nOnce the OpCo has been operationalized and possesses similar payroll capabilities as the Arbitrum Foundation, we believe that responsibilities for the DAO’s multisigs should be transferred to that entity. When that time comes, Entropy recommends for the Arbitrum Foundation and future head of OpCo to update the DAO with a joint statement.\n\nIf this proposal is rejected, then delegates would be signalling a preference to keep utilizing the MSS until OpCo’s formation, at which point the conversation can be restarted on moving the payment function to that entity. If this is the prevailing decision, a top up would almost certainly be necessary to allow time for the full onchain proposal process & any possible follow-up procedures. In this scenario, Entropy will work to create a proposal that restructures the MSS, taking into account learnings and the opinions of relevant parties.\n\n## Timeline\n\nMay 22nd: Forum Post\nMay 29th - June 5th: Snapshot vote\nJune 6th: If approved, transfer of the previous MSS multisigs to the Foundation will begin.\nJune 15th: MSS' term comes to an end\n\n## Voting Options\n\n1. **For (Wind Down the MSS):** In support of winding down the MSS and transferring ownership of the payment vertical to the Arbitrum Foundation in the interim.\n2. **Against (Continue with the MSS):** Entropy begins working on a solution to the shortfall and creating a revised proposal that addresses the future structure of the payment vertical.\n3. **Abstain**",

        "body": "This description has been shortened to meet Snapshot character limits. Please find the full proposal on the forums: https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/establishing-a-dao-events-budget-for-2025/26734\n\n## Abstract\n\nTo ensure Arbitrum’s continued presence at the industry’s most prominent events, and to enable the DAO to host in-person initiatives to accelerate collaboration and increase efficiency of operations, we (Entropy Advisors, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe) would like to earmark a budget for events for 2025 and take lead on running ongoing RFPs to satisfy the DAOs event demands. The 3 members of this group will lean on OCL and the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that any events organized by the DAO are aligned with the broader ecosystem of contributors, work towards a unified message/brand, and are synergistic with events led by the Foundation and OCL.\n\nOur proposed Events strategy should focus on 2 key categories:\n\n1. Delegate Gatherings aimed at streamlining operations through in-person meetups such as a delegate retreat.\n2. Ecosystem Growth Events to foster innovation and community engagement, ideally coinciding with other major crypto conferences (specifically ETHDenver, Bitcoin 2025: Las Vegas, EthCC, among other potential events) at the same location. These events can include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * Virtual hackathons\n  * Non-crypto conference presence (RustConf, CES, etc.)\n  * In-person hackathons\n  * Side events\n  * Sponsorships of major events\n  * Arbitrum Days around the world (not just EthCC)\n  * Educational workshops (Stylus & Orbit)\n\nThe selection of event provider(s) will follow a two-step process: Together with the ADPC and Disruption Joe, we will gauge community sentiment/attendance levels regarding certain events. If there is consensus to put on a certain event but there is no PM/event coordinator to lead the effort, the group will procure, select, and support service providers to make the vision a reality. It is highly likely the OCL or the Arbitrum Foundation will lead many of these events, which is made apparent by the preliminary schedule proposed below. Alternatively, if an events provider comes to the DAO with a proposal for an event that passes a Snapshot vote that garners at least 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority For/Abstain, the funds for that proposal will come from the 2025 events budget brought forth in this proposal.\n\nWe propose the earmarking of $1.5M USD to fund this initiative, with any unused funds at the end of 2025 to be returned to the DAO treasury. 4M ARB will be sent to a Foundation-controlled address to be liquidated into stablecoins, with any excess ARB immediately returned to the DAO treasury and the stablecoins to an MSS-controlled address. The ADPC, Entropy, and Disruption Joe will be waiving payment to get this stood up, but we expect this initiative to fall under the OpCo once it becomes fully operational. We also envision a dedicated employee to lead the DAO’s event strategy within the OpCo, so this is more of an effort to get the ball rolling so we are properly prepared for 2025. We plan to have the OpCo established in mid 2025, and once an events coordinator is employed by this entity, the funds will be transferred to the OpCo while Entropy, the ADPC, and Disruption Joe will be relieved of their duties thereafter.\n\n## Specifications\n\nIn order to eliminate the potential for event overload, we are capping the number of delegate gatherings to two for the year - but are leaving the number of ecosystem growth events open-ended. These events should be planned in such a way that no two events align too closely with one another on dates, with the exception of delegate offsites which could coincide with an ecosystem growth event at a major crypto conference given the convenience of planning travel arrangements. While the primary goal of delegate offsites should be aligning ecosystem leaders and providing a dedicated place/time for more efficient in-person working hours, the ecosystem growth category is more vague in nature. However, all applicants should have clearly articulated goals for the events in line with the defined events strategy, i.e., driving the adoption of Stylus through a hackathon, generating thought-provoking governance proposals, or onboarding new people into the DAO similar to GovHack. Events brought forward by either an individual or service provider, must create a post-event impact report ([example](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/govhack-ethcc-brussels-2024-impact-report-hack-humanity/26530?u=entropy) from Govhack Brussels) that includes a breakdown of actual costs. Service providers that are procured to execute on an event idea will also be required to provide a post-event impact report.\n\nFor concrete examples of how this could work, we can take a look at the 2 proposals for events currently on the forum. The GovHack Core proposal (which has since been rescinded) was brought forth by Hack Humanity, which serves as a great example of a scenario where the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy would not have been needed in the process at all. Hack Humanity could have taken their proposal to Snapshot, and because they were the service provider themselves, there was no need for any type of procurement process. If the GovHack Core proposal passed snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain, the funds would be sent from the 2025 events budget (this proposal) and Hack Humanity could have begun their planning. This would eliminate the ~4-week onchain voting process and potentially make it possible to put something together for DevCon in Bangkok in just ~2 months.\n\nThis is a prime example of how earmarking an events budget will enable the DAO to move more nimbly. Please note that this proposal is only for 2025, so the previous example is only provided for illustrative purposes. However, it is quite possible that the DAO would rather fund GovHacks on an as-needed/case-by-case basis rather than a whole year, or even open up the event type to other service providers to get new actors involved or potentially lower the price.\n\nIn an earlier iteration of a proposal from [@danielo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/danielo), there was no defined offsite facilitator. This is an example of a proposal that did not specify the service provider, so the ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy could have worked together in procuring the proper coordinator upon the proposal passing on Snapshot with 3% of the votable token supply and a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain. The procurement process should bring down overall costs by making the process competitive amongst service providers, and again reduces the lead time by foregoing the onchain Tally vote. Note that this is just an example for illustrative purposes.\n\nIt is expected that the contributor requesting a specific event is tasked with defining the measurable KPIs. The DAO will be tasked with deeming a specific events proposal worthwhile via Snapshot, and we encourage delegates to hold these authors to a high standard when it comes to measuring a given event’s impact and how it pushes Arbitrum’s mission forward.\n\n## Flow of Funds\n\nTo cover the $1.5M dollar-denominated expenses, 4M ARB would be earmarked and sent to an Arbitrum Foundation-controlled wallet, with funds liquidated into a preferred stablecoin and then sent to a MSS-controlled address .Surplus ARB will be sent back to the DAO Treasury following the liquidation. Entropy Advisors, Disruption Joe, and the ADPC will be the point of contact for the MSS chair to greenlight any queued transactions. No transactions will be signed without confirmations from all 3 entities/individuals. The MSS may send stablecoins back to the Arbitrum Foundation in order to pay service providers with fiat if required. Excess funds will either be moved over to the OpCo once a dedicated events coordinator has been hired, or fully returned to the DAO by the end of 2025.\n\nUpdates related to funds spent, upcoming events and relevant details, a place to provide feedback or recommendations, or any other communications will be posted to the [ADPC update thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/procurement-committee/27) on the Arbitrum Forum. Alternatively, Entropy can post these to our [updates thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/c/dao-grant-programs/entropy-advisors-updates/50) on the Arbitrum Forum.\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n1. September 10th: “Establishing a DAO Events Budget for 2025” Forum post (4 weeks)\n2. October 10th: Snapshot Vote\n3. October 24th: Tally vote (If Snapshot passes and depending on feedback)\n4. November 11th: The ADPC, Disruption Joe, and Entropy Advisors can begin working with OCL/the AF and other individuals/SPs to ensure the events calendar brought forth comes to fruition. Dependent on the outcome of the Tally vote.\n\nWe expect this process to take about 2-3 months in its entirety to get underway, which will provide the DAO ample time to prepare for its 2025 events.\n\n## Overall Ask\n\nThe upfront ask to the DAO is $1.5M and the transfer of 4M ARB with the excess returned to the DAO post liquidation, but with just 3 ecosystem growth events outlined in this proposal, the entire budget will not be utilized. However, as mentioned earlier, earmarking these funds gives the DAO the ability to act more nimbly when there is an opportunity to host an event. This will result in the DAO getting better pricing from potential service providers while ensuring the service provider has ample time to do what they do best - organize great events. The DAO can clawback funds from the MSS at any time via a snapshot vote that garners 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain.",

        "body": "### Non-Constitutional\n\nThis proposal has been worked on in collaboration with the entire STEP 2 Committee where consensus was reached on this proposed path forward.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO held approximately $3.5 million in USDM, a yield-bearing stablecoin from Mountain Protocol. This treasury asset purchase was a part of the STEP 1 program. Following Anchorage Digital Acquiring Mountain and the [announced wind-down](https://docs.mountainprotocol.com/usdm-wind-down-overview) of USDM, the Arbitrum Foundation has already redeemed the entirety of the DAO’s USDM position, which is now in USDC. This proposal reallocates the fully redeemed funds (~$3.5M USDC) to the STEP 2 budget.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale:\n\nThis is a straightforward administrative action to ensure the assets allocated to STEP remain yield bearing. At an estimated 4.5% on $3.5M, the DAO is missing out on ~$13k per month while these funds sit in USDC. Given the extremely recent review of RWAs and acceptance of the STEP 2 allocation, this is a simple path forward that the committee believes should enable these assets to get to work in high-quality yield-bearing assets.\n\nFor further context, the STEP 2 budget has been partially liquidated, but some of the allocated ARB is still awaiting swapping. Additionally, none of the STEP 2 funds have been allocated yet (in progress).\n\n## Specifications\n\nThis proposal, if passed via Snapshot with more votes For than Against, will enable the Arbitrum Foundation to move all funds redeemed from USDM into the previously approved STEP 2 allocation:\n\n* [WisdomTree WTGXX](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/wisdomtree-wtgxx-step-application/28756): 30%\n* [Spiko USTBL](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/step-2-application-spiko-ustbl/28752): 35%\n* [Franklin Templeton FOBXX (BENJI)](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/franklin-onchain-u-s-government-money-fund-fobxx-step-application/23655): 35%\n\n## Budget\n\nThis proposal requires no additional funds from the DAO and will proceed to Snapshot Thursday June 5th.\n\n*Disclaimer The information provided in this proposal is for educational and informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice.

        "body": "# Abstract\n\nArbitrum lacks an efficient mechanism to swap funds for projects, which has led to multiple challenges for service providers around token price changes. Specifically, the Hackathon Continuation Program is currently underfunded by $89,980 USD due to token price drop before RnDAO received any funds.\n\nBeyond usual market risks, the program faced prolonged market risks due to delays as we worked with the Arbitrum Foundation on an improved fund management system for DAO-led investments, creating a valuable process template for the Arbitrum ecosystem, but exposing us to this situation.\n\nThis proposal suggests using a portion of the Domain Allocator (i.e. Questbook grant program) funds left over from the season 1 (a bit over $200k, due to be returned to the DAO) to “top up” the Hackathon Continuation Program and allow it to continue as approved by the DAO.\n\nWe’ll also propose an option in the vote for the remaining funds from the Domain Allocator season 1, to be sent to the Treasury Management Committee to increase their stablecoin pool. Said pool could be used by service providers in the future to cover shortfalls as per a process to be designed by the TMC ([see their first draft here](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/tmc-stablecoin-withdrawal-process/28877)).\n\n# [](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-consitutional-top-up-for-hackathon-continuation-program/29064#p-69807-rationale-2)Rationale\n\nWhat’s the current status and why did the shortfall happen?  \nThe Hackathon Continuation Program is divided into two phases, with separate payments for each. The MSS holds enough funds to complete payments for projects in Phase 1 of the program and has some USDC remaining for Phase 2 but not enough to complete the program.\n\nThe complexity of this specific initiative (the first investment program setup via the DAO) meant we needed to figure out a system for fund management for investments. The initial approach proposed would have required additional bureaucracy (register RnDAO signers and the RnDAO multisig setup for project investments as part of the AF) and so, in cooperation with the Foundation, we devised an improved approach that would see RnDAO scheduling payments directly on the MSS while the MSS signers would approve payments.\n\nThe system devised can be used moving forward to facilitate future investment programs, unlocking a valuable milestone for the DAO to test investments and improve the ROI of ecosystem development programs. However, the money requested was to be paid in stables, and the conversion didn’t happen immediately.  \nSeeing the market drop, in coordination with the AF, RnDAO tried to delay the swapping of funds as long as possible to allow for a market recovery; unfortunately, the price didn’t recover in time, and it was required to swap at a reduced token price to meet the program obligations for Phase 1. Leading to a budget shortfall for Phase 2.\n\nAdvancing the program is time-sensitive, as the projects are now expecting the funding and support to progress. Any further delays could cause them to fail or migrate to other ecosystems.\n\n**Is this a precedent?**\n\nThe funds left over from Season 1 of the Domain Allocator programs are due to be returned to the DAO. Authorising a transfer to the MSS for usage in the Hackathon Continuation Program (HCP) (while the rest of the funds are sent to the DAO/AF) would be a one-time action that would provide timely reassurance to the HCP projects. Given that the rest of the funds would be returned, this approach would not become a recurring mechanism in the DAO.\n\n**What about the Domain Allocator programs?**\n\nBoth programs follow the same objective of supporting builders in Arbitrum.\n\nThe approach proposed in this proposal was suggested by [@jojo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo) as a viable route, given the small sums needed and the availability of the funds.\n\n**What about the Treasury Management Committee and the checking account?**\n\nThe TMC V 1.2 proposal sets $ 15 million USD equivalent to be converted to Stables and serve as a reserve for service providers. The TMC has proposed a mechanism based on using the yield of this reserve, which will take time to accrue. As such, the proposed strategy can cover a short-term gap in the proposed mechanism.\n\n**Calculation of the exact amount:**\n\nAs per the AF post ([Hackathon Continuation Program - #149 by Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/hackathon-continuation-program/27492/149)), 2 Arb were left after Phase 1. However, having eliminated one project that underdelivered from Phase 1, we have saed an additional $12k (held in the MSS). Bringing the shortfall for Phase 2 to: $101,980 - $12,000 = $89,980 USD.\n\n# [](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-consitutional-top-up-for-hackathon-continuation-program/29064#p-69807-specifications-3)Specifications\n\nThis proposal authorises the transfer of $89,980 USD of the leftover funds from the Season 1 Domain Allocator program’s SAFE, to the Arbitrum Foundation, and from the AF to the MSS for the Hackathon Continuation Program.  \nThis transfer route was selected for compliance reasons.\n\nAddtionally, an option to send the leftover funds (after covering the 89k needed for the Hackathon Continuation program) to the Arbiturm Foundation and from there to the Treasury Management Committee.\n\n# [](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-consitutional-top-up-for-hackathon-continuation-program/29064#p-69807-budget-4)Budget\n\nNo additional funds from the DAO are needed. Just the authorisation to use the leftover from Domain Allocator season 1.\n\n# [](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-non-consitutional-top-up-for-hackathon-continuation-program/29064#p-69807-voting-options-5)Voting options\n\nA. **only top-up the HCP**: top-up the HCP and leftover funds to the DAO  \nB. **yes to both**: top-up the HCP and leftover funds to the TMC  \nC. **againts**:all funds to the DAO (don’t top-up the HCP nor TMC)  \nD. **abstain**",

        "body": "The Arbitrum DAO Procurement Committee (ADPC), composed of Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal, is proposing to extend its term for an additional 6 months. The initial phase, which ends on August 20, 2024, was a proof of concept that established a comprehensive procurement process to support Arbitrum DAO's decentralized governance structure. This second phase, starting upon the successful on-chain vote, aims to build on the successes and lessons learned from the pilot phase, with a focus on delivering strategic procurement benefits for the DAO.\n\n## Key Achievements in Phase I:\nDuring its first phase, the ADPC successfully implemented procurement frameworks and marketplaces uniquely tailored for Arbitrum DAO, creating a foundation for cost savings and operational efficiency. Through the development of a solid legal and operational infrastructure, the committee has positioned Arbitrum DAO as a leader not just in the technical sphere but also in decentralized governance. The pilot phase showcased the benefits of using advanced sourcing methodologies and well-structured procurement to enhance the DAO’s operations.\n_______________________\n## Plans for Phase II:\n\n### 1. Procurement for Two Key Vertical Sectors:\n\n**Vertical 1:** Focused on procuring RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers for projects building in the Arbitrum ecosystem. This decision is based on thorough engagement with DAO delegates and stakeholders, identifying RPC services as a core requirement for projects in the ecosystem.\n\n**Vertical 2:** Aims to manage procurement for events scheduled within the DAO's Events Strategy for 2025. The ADPC will work in collaboration with Entropy Advisors and Disruption Joe, though no separate funding will be requested for event services in this proposal. The ADPC will create evaluation criteria, publish a request for proposals (RFP), and evaluate responses from potential suppliers. However, contract negotiations will not be handled by the ADPC, as they will fall under the purview of the Arbitrum Foundation or other third parties involved.\n\n### 2. Continued Management of the Subsidy Fund for Security Services:\nBuilding on the success of the initial cohort, the ADPC will continue overseeing the security services fund and will publish a proposal for its extension.\n\n### 3. Operational Expense (OpEx) Budget Creation:\nThe ADPC will define and propose an OpEx budget for the Arbitrum DAO, which will be managed by the Multi-Signature Safe (MSS). This will allow the DAO to use services from whitelisted providers without needing to undergo the full proposal process (Forum, Snapshot, On-Chain). The proposal will include multiple budget options for the community to vote on, allowing flexibility in how the budget is allocated.\n\n### 4. Phase II Outcome Report:\nUpon completion of the second phase, the ADPC will publish a detailed report outlining the results and key achievements, similar to the one produced for Phase I. This report will be submitted to the DAO for review.\n\n### 5. Alignment with DAO Stakeholders:\nThe ADPC will continue to engage with key stakeholders within the DAO to ensure that it remains aligned with the evolving governance structure of Arbitrum, particularly as the DAO explores potential changes like establishing an operating company (OpCo). The ADPC will also handle ad-hoc tasks, such as connecting whitelisted service providers with new projects or proposals within the DAO.\n\n### 6. Optional Additional Vertical Sectors:\nUpon successful completion of the work packages outlined above, the ADPC may take on up to two additional verticals based on DAO demand and the committee’s capacity. This work would require approval through the DAO’s governance process and would be contingent on the ADPC’s term being extended if necessary.\n_______________________\n## Budget for Phase II:\nThe total budget for this 6-month period is $414,000. This amount includes operational expenses and will be disbursed in six monthly installments. The funding request will (based on prices at the time of posting and subject to change) total 915,658 ARB, calculated based on the average ARB price at $0.5425/ARB. A buffer is included to protect against ARB price depreciation, ensuring that the ADPC can meet its financial obligations. The funds will be OTC’d to USDC. Any unutilized ARB will be returned to the Arbitrum DAO treasury at the end of the term.\n_______________________\n## Additional Information:\nThe proposal also includes the re-election of the current ADPC members (Axis Advisory, Areta, and Daimon Legal) to continue their roles in Phase II. This is intended to provide continuity and ensure that the progress made in Phase I can be built upon without interruption.\n\nThe committee believes that by extending its tenure, it can continue to deliver significant value to the Arbitrum ecosystem by optimizing procurement processes, securing vital services, and enabling a smoother governance structure for the DAO. Ultimately, the ADPC’s work in Phase II will help position Arbitrum DAO for long-term success, both in terms of operational efficiency and decentralized governance practices.",
