As anybody can top-up LINK on the Aave Robot via a permissionless function on the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, the community could request for external entities to partially or totally cover the execution costs of proposals by using it.\n- As in some cases it could be desirable for example to disable automation of a specific proposal and this is not possible with \"slow\" governance procedures, a Robot Guardian role is defined that will be able to 1) disable automation for a certain governance proposal and 2) \"pause\" automation on a specific network.\nBoth actions are non-invasive, as it only affects the automation system, not the underlying governance system at all.\nInitially, BGD will keep the Robot Guardian role.\n\n### Setup flow\n\nFor the DAO to activate the system the procedure is simply the following:\n1. A technical service provider (BGD in this case) will deploy both the Robot smart contracts and the `AaveCLRobotOperator`, on each supported network.\n2. A governance proposal will be submitted to activate and configured those robots, and top them up with LINK from the Aave Collector.\n\nAfterwards, the DAO can register new robots via governance proposal, or manage the registered ones however needed.",
