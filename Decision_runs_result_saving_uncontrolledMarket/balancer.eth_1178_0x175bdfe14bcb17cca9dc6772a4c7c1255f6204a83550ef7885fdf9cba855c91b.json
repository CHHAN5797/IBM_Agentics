Another ~5-10k AURA remains unvested and will be claimed at a later date.\n\nWe are proposing to initiate another lock with the available ~255k AURA to be used to vote on AURA governance. The specifics of the Balancer DAOs voting allocations can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419).\n\nBy re-locking the initial position and vesting additional AURA between June 27th and July 4th which would fall into the same locking epoch, it is guaranteed that the entirety of the locks will be up for re-lock in 16 weeks, reducing load on the multi-sig, streamlining the management of this position.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the vlAURA contract at `0x3fa73f1e5d8a792c80f426fc8f84fbf7ce9bbcac` and call `processExpiredLocks` with argument `true` - The execution needs to be timed AFTER June 27th and BEFORE July 4th\n\nAdditionally, the DAO multisig on mainnet `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call the `claim` function on the AuraVestedEscrow at `0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422` with the parameter `_lock` set to `true`. This execution, as well as the above, needs to be timed AFTER June 27th and BEFORE July 4th",

        "body": "Payload with PR:\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1420\n\n# Background\n\nThe DAO claimed its AURA allocation and locked it in [BIP-481](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-481-claim-and-lock-balancer-dao-aura-allocation-into-vlaura/5319), and later more claiming/locking occurred via [BIP-551](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-551-claim-and-relock-balancer-daos-aura-vlaura/5588) and [BIP-638](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-638-claim-and-relock-balancer-daos-additional-aura-vlaura/5811). As a result the DAO multisig now has 2m vlAURA, which will become available to be relocked `2024-10-17 00:00UTC` and will otherwise unlock `2024-10-24 00:00UTC`.\n\nThe voting power is actively being used strategically every epoch, and the DAO would like to keep doing so. Therefore, in order to (1) prevent having to create a new BIP for every relock, and to (2) reduce the risk of the DAO multisig not being able to execute this relocking every cycle within the right time window, we developed a Safe module that does this automatically: [`AuraLockerModule.sol`](https://github.com/onchainification/aura_locker_v2/blob/main/src/AuraLockerModule.sol).\n \n![99c62e3a1b141e4650ec239242ef693d3ad5acce.png](ipfs://bafkreiadk3sqmjsnpbwggqpx57ljurxvt5t5ze5jpuzjytwknlhyrgikiq)\n    \n# Summary\n\nThe proposal here is to enable this module on the DAO multisig, and to thus let the module, on behalf of the DAO multisig, relock all vlAURA automatically every cycle as soon as that becomes possible. If this were to for some reason fail, the DAO multisig will have the mandate to relock manually every cycle. The module can be disabled at any time to prevent relocking from occurring, if the DAO were to have other plans with its AURA allocation.\n\n# Risks\n\nA variant of the same contract by the same author has been [running in production](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC485aFD2f3252cCB69d1c94392701d51013D42eB) successfully for a different DAO. [This Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/4143358) shows all of its successful automatic relocking events (note how almost all of them occur at the first block at midnight UTC). Besides Maxi’s internal reviews, a Balancer Labs contributor (@mkflow27) did a review of the contract. If the module fails to perform its task, the DAO multisig still has 7 days to relock via a manual call (`0x3Fa73f1E5d8A792C80F426fc8F84FBF7Ce9bBCAC.processExpiredUnlocks(true)`).\n\n# Payload\n\nDAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` on Ethereum will call `enableModule(0xfD20C63554A9916816dC5e5Df596A0333185F263)` on itself.",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/916\n\nOverview\n\nOriginally when BeethovenX was approved as a friendly fork 10 million BEETS was set aside for the DAO to unlock via a vest. This can be seen here in the original vote. https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc to receive 4% of the total supply, 250M tokens, which can be confirmed in BEETS [tokenomics](https://docs.beets.fi/beets/tokenomics). The purpose of this proposal is to update the fantom wallet responsible for this vesting contract with the maxis as signers. The maxis will then claim the fully vested balance of BEETS, and transfer it to the DAO Multisig on Optimism. This is to make the bridging process streamlined. For the time being this will consolidate the multisigs utilized by the DAO as fantom is a relatively inactive network. There is no plan to utilize the BEETS tokens in any way for the time being, but an additional proposal can be made to do so at a later time.\n\nThe current DAO Multisig on Fantom will not be utilized after these actions unless absolutely necessary after this proposal. The likelihood of it's use is incredibly low due to the networks activity, and Balancer's influence in the Fantom ecosystem.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe DAO Multisig ftm: `0xFe2022da08d17ac8388F5bEFE4F71456255105A4` will call `addOwnerWithThreshold` on itself six times, with the `threshold` equal to `6` and the following new `owner` addresses:\n\n`0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17`\n`0xafFC70b81D54F229A5F50ec07e2c76D2AAAD07Ae`\n`0xc4591c41e01a7a654B5427f39Bbd1dEe5bD45D1D`\n`0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516`\n`0x11761c7b08287d9489CD84C04DF6852F5C07107b`\n`0xcf4fF1e03830D692F52EB094c52A5A6A2181Ab3F`\n\nThese can be confirmed via [bal_addresses](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/4396ca6ee46272111bb6db65e5054af079e58dda/extras/signers.json#L2)\n\nThe DAO Multisig ftm: `0xFe2022da08d17ac8388F5bEFE4F71456255105A4` will then interact with the vesting contract `0x8D381EC09356C3F1805c54B2BB0867e8b417DC3a` calling `release` with the BEETS token address `0xF24Bcf4d1e507740041C9cFd2DddB29585aDCe1e` as the `token` argument. \n\nOnce the BEETS is received it will sent to the Maxi Multisig until further notice by calling `transfer` on `ftm:0xF24Bcf4d1e507740041C9cFd2DddB29585aDCe1e` with the recipient as `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e` and amount `10000000000000000000000000`",
