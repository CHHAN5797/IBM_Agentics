    "summary": "The MUX Protocol proposal requests a 6M ARB grant to reduce trading fees to zero across integrated perpetual DEXs and incentivize liquidity in its native pool, aiming to boost user adoption and trading volume on Arbitrum. The timeline voting data shows unanimous early support for the 'For' option. Forum sentiment is mixed but leans positive with strong endorsements highlighting MUX's role as a leading perp DEX aggregator with significant organic volume and TVL. Concerns raised about grant size and overlap with partner protocols have been addressed by the proposal's grant size reduction and detailed anti-abuse measures. Historical adjacent proposals with similar early unanimous support suffered post-vote market declines, suggesting caution. However, MUX's strategic role and community backing support a positive change stance.",
