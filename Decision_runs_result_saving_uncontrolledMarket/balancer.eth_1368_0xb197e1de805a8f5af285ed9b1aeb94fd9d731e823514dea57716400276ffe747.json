The sFRAX token represents pro rata deposits within the vault and is always withdrawable for FRAX stablecoins at the pro rata rate at all times. - [Frax ](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n> * Frax Finance is a decentralized lending platform which issues the FRAX stablecoin. Frax Finance algorithmically sustains the value of FRAX through the use of fractional collateral reserves. The collateral used on Frax Finance is split between an accepted collateral (e.g. ether) and Frax Finance’s governance token, FXS. The collateralization ratio for FRAX changes based on its price. - [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/pt-BR/prices/Frax?timestamp=1705682853673)\n\n> # Motivation\n>\n>\n>\n> By using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD.

E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds**: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n>\n>\n>\n> Several E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins.

At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs ](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website ](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * [When staking ETH with RocketPool] you will be given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH you deposited, and when you deposited it.

They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for liquid staking tokens, is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n> * **The pool shall be a ‘Core’ pool with a swap fee of 1 basis points, i.e., 0.01% at pool inception.** The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope. As a Core pool it will be eligible for fee recycling.\n\n> ## References/Useful links\n> \n> * [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n\n> ## Protocol description\n> \n> * stETH is a token that represents staked ether in Lido, combining the value of initial deposit + staking rewards. stETH tokens are minted upon deposit and burned when redeemed. stETH token balances are issued 1:1 to the ethers that are staked by Lido. stETH token’s balances are updated when the oracle reports change in total stake every day. - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230610-what-is-steth)\n> * wstETH is a wrapped version of regular stETH, while wETH is a wrapped version of Ethereum.\n> * swETH is an ERC-20 token that represents a user’s staked ETH in the Ethereum blockchain inclusive of any accrued rewards and penalties from the consensus layer, and MEV and ‘tips’ from the execution layer. The amount of swETH held will not change over a period of time but the underlying value of the token will increase as the rewards accrue on chain. - [Swell](https://docs.swellnetwork.io/swell/system-design/staking-with-sweth/sweth-token)\n> * The E-CLP uses an internal conversion to avoid a unit drift of yield-accruing tokens.\n\n> ## Motivation\n> \n> **We expect the E-CLP to improve capital efficiency significantly.** The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n> \n> * **Customizable liquidity profiles:** Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n> * **Price bounds:** The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n> \n> For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs view: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps\n> \n> E-CLPs have been developed for stablecoin pools that include the upcoming Gyroscope stablecoin, GYD. However, they can find broader application, whenever the expected trading range of the included assets can be informed by external business logic (e.g. from arbitrage loops of mints/ redemptions in the case of LSTs).\n\n## Specifications\n\n> ### Governance\n> \n> The Gyroscope Protocol is in limited production live on Polygon. The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n> ### Oracles\n> \n> * rateProvider0 (for wstETH): [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768#code)\n> * rateProvider1 (for swETH): [0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf951E335afb289353dc249e82926178EaC7DEd78)\n> * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n\n> ### Audits\n> \n> Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports).

    "ai_final_reason": "• The voting timeline shows a unanimous and stable lead for 'Yes, let's do it' with no support for alternatives, indicating clear voter consensus.\n• Historical similar proposals enabling new gauges had strong support and resulted in positive market and TVL impacts, supporting the desirability of this change.\n• Forum sentiment is neutral with limited comments, showing neither opposition nor strong support, so it does not conflict with the recommendation.\n• Despite post-vote negative price and TVL impacts, these are not factored into the decision; the recommendation aligns with maximizing the organization's long-term health.\n• The recommendation mirrors the aggregated vote sentiment and is consistent with successful past gauge enabling proposals.",
