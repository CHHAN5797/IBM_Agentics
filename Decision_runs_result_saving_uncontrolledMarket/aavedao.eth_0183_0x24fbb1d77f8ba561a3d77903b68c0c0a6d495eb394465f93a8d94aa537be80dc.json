It has also seen large demand for use as collateral on other lending protocols.\n\nIn order to capitalize on this demand, we propose deploying a dedicated Aave v3 instance for Ethena’s stablecoins and related collateral assets. \n\nTo start the instance will use sUSDe and USDe as main collateral assets, with USDC, DAI and USDT as supply assets. \n\nWe also propose providing the Ethena instance with an initial GHO facilitator. \n\nThe goals for this instance will be to grow Aave market share for borrowers using sUSDe and USDe as well as create an additional steady revenue stream of GHO. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Ethena Aave v3 instance will implement the following:\n\n- The market will include sUSDe, USDe, USDC, DAI, USDT and a new GHO facilitator. Additional assets to consider during ARFC are Ethena’s Pendle PT tokens and rsUSDe.\n- This GHO facilitator will be limited in size to start both to limit risk to Ethena collateral and protect liquidity and the GHO peg.\n- The market will have stablecoin E-Mode to allow for high leverage borrowing between the correlated assets.\n- The market will use the existing sUSDe and USDe capped oracles, so that borrowers are not affected by fluctuations in the secondary market price.\n- Borrow parameters will match the mainnet Aave v3 instance, making it the most competitive location to borrow against sUSDe and USDe.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated by Ethena for the publication of this proposal.\n\nACI team members are holders of sUSDe, USDe and ENA.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard osGNO to Aave v3 Gnosis\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-29\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to Onboard osGNO, the Liquid Staking Token (LST) of StakeWise V3 into the GnosisMarket. By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nGNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain. \n\nosGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.\n\nCreating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.  \n\nosGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism). If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.\n\nosETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nPotential POL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nosGNO announcement post: https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\n\nosGNO Vaults: https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeWise and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and some ACI team members are holders of GNO.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. \n\nTo enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).\n\nCurrently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. \n\nOther liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. \n\nThe liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\nIntegrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.\n\nConfidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\n [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.\n\nIntegration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.\n\n### Specification\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Audits & Relevant links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n Issuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nWhitepaper: CDCETH\nDeFillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: https://crypto.com/staking\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\n\nCommunity:\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/cryptocom\nTelegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nNews on Telegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nDiscord: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-09-02\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nStakeStone is the protocol issuing STONE, the liquid ETH, with over 150k users. Currently, StakeStone is seeking support to onboard STONE to Aave V3 on Scroll and is launching a series of initiatives to boost liquidity and Aave adoption.\n\n### **Motivation/Background**\n\nSTONE is an ERC-20 rebalancing token that generates risk-free rewards for ETH based on blue-chip underlying assets like Lido, EigenLayer, and Symbiotic in a decentralized manner through our OPAP governance mechanism. StakeStone currently has $350 million worth of STONE deployed on Scroll. To ensure that STONE has robust liquidity, in addition to the STONE-ETH DEX liquidity on Scroll, STONE also has PMM powered cross-chain liquidity. Users can perform cross-chain redemption and receive ETH on the Ethereum mainnet within 40 seconds, with optimized pricing.\n\nSTONE aims to become the liquid ETH, covering users’ opportunity costs while creating more use cases for STONE holders. Thanks to its architecture supporting multiple underlying assets, STONE can maintain market adaptability and stability over the long term, allowing users and the protocol to avoid the need to mint or integrate a new asset.\n\n**Benefits of listing STONE token:**\n\nSTONE is collaborating with Scroll to build a DeFi ecosystem. STONE works closely with various protocols to support the ecosystem and facilitate their go-to-market strategies. Currently, STONE is the largest asset category on Scroll, accounting for over 30% of the total TVL across the chain, with a high utilization rate (close to 90%). The StakeStone team is dedicated to offering services to protocols that support STONE while fostering collaboration for shared prosperity, which is reflected in the high utilization of STONE across various DeFi use cases.\n\n**Market Impact:**\n\nAs of today, over 180,000 ETH have been staked in StakeStone, with a historical high of 340,000 ETH. StakeStone has also successfully processed nearly 1 billion dollars in inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, STONE has a wide user base, and all users are very active on-chain. We hope that this active community can bring more liquidity and activity to AAVE.\n\n### **Chain to be deployed/listed:**\n\nScroll chain. Scroll grew to become the top zk rollup in terms of TVL and shows continued strength in community and volume.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nStakeStone has collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity for a more robust and diverse liquidity environment at AAVE. Large liquidity providers are highly interested in using STONE in AAVE and further boosting DEX liquidity for STONE. StakeStone will also have its own liquidity mining incentive campaign for STONE in AAVE.\n\nTo incentivize the use of STONE in AAVE, StakeStone will provide boosted STONE points for STONE suppliers and is planning a yield-boost campaign specifically designed to maximize engagement.\n\nAmong our active liquidity providers, we have gathered strong interest in using STONE for lending and borrowing. The team will actively engage with liquidity providers to achieve a supply of at least 5,000 STONE, gradually increasing it over time as risk parameters are adjusted.\n\n### Specification\n\nFollowing analysis from Chaos Labs, the recommend the following parameter settings are:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 4,800 |\n| Borrow Cap | 480 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72.5% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.00% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### Other relevant information\n\nSTONE has undergone multiple rounds of audits conducted by firms such as Quantstamp, Slowmist, Veridise, and Secure3, and closely collaborates with security organizations like Cobo and Coincover.\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n[Dune Analytics for data about STONE](https://dune.com/HolyMoon/stakestone)\n\n[Security audits](https://docs.stakestone.io/stakestone/additionals/audits-and-security)\n\n[Governance votes about asset](https://app.stakestone.io/u/portfolio-allocation/vote/vote-list)\n\n[OPAP proposal example](https://x.com/Stake_Stone/status/1772286551340286261)\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeStone and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
