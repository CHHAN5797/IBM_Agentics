Cameron from the ecosystem team at Consensys reaching out regarding a proposal for a Balancer deployment on Linea.\n\n*Please see the contact information below if you would like to reach out directly regarding this proposal.*\n\n## Intro\n\nWe recently launched the public Linea Testnet and saw overwhelmingly positive feedback from community members, users, and builders. To date, Linea has processed >11M transactions, many of which are helping us stress-test the network. In addition, the Linea team is closely aligned with developers in the ecosystem. As such, we aim to serve developers, protocols, and builders. We see Balancer as a critical piece of DeFi infrastructure to enable innovation.\n\nBalancer is more than a unique AMM; it's a versatile and adaptive protocol offering innovative features such as multi-asset pools, custom weight allocation, boosted pools, and the x-chain gauges enabled with L0. These features facilitate a wide array of DeFi strategies while providing significant advantages for growing ecosystems and the start-ups building in them.\n\nMetaMask swaps is also leveraging Balancer among the meta aggregator providers, so this deployment is key for Linea to ensure MetaMask swaps can work on Linea on mainnet from day 0 with a low switching cost.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\n### Proposal\n\nThis proposal asks the Balancer community to support deployment on the Linea testnet & Linea mainnet. Balancer's unique capabilities, paired with Linea's advanced zkEVM technology, would be a leap forward in strengthening and diversifying the DeFi ecosystem on Linea.\n\nThis proposal to deploy Balancer on Linea is about more than just bringing a protocol to Linea. It's about enabling innovation and opportunities for builders.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe have had significant interest from Linea builders, partners, and the MetaMask team to have a deployment of Balancer. These builders look forward to leveraging x-chain boosts, multiasset pools, and building protocols on top of balancer as infrastructure.\n\nMoreso, although Consensys will not always be the only support for linea development, we have a team of engineers to assist with onboarding and the innovation of new features enabled through Zks or account abstraction.\n\nWe look forward to featuring the protocol on Linea’s portal and supporting the success of the protocol on Linea.\n\n## About Linea\n\n### Linea\n\nLinea handles native EVM bytecode for proving and verification to allow the execution of Solidity smart contracts and enable developers to build on a zk-rollup while using familiar tools and infrastructure. The ConsenSys zkEVM aims to be a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence with the Ethereum VM specification specified in the yellow paper.\n\nLinea does not use transpilers or custom compilers to generate the zkProofs. Taking the compiled bytecode directly from solidity significantly reduces deployment costs and surface area risk for bugs and hacks.\n\n### Other Information\n\nPlease see more details here:\n\n1. [Linea Website](http://linea.build)\n2. [Linea Block Explorer](https://explorer.goerli.linea.build/)\n3. [Linea Docs](https://docs.linea.build/)\n4. [Consensys: R&D](https://consensys.net/research-and-development/)\n\n### Timeline/Next Steps\n\nWe encourage thoughtful community discussion and will facilitate that. If this proposal passes, we will work closely with contributors on a timeline that aligns with Balancer contributors and Linea mainnet deployment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn light of this proposal, we are eager to strengthen our alliance with Balancer through this deployment. By deploying Balancer on Linea, we aim to enable a seamless user experience and growth in our communities!\n\nBuild on,\n\n## Contact Information\n\n- Email: [Governance@Consensys.net](mailto:Cameron.ODonnell@Consensys.net)\n- Forum: DAOstrat.C\n- Tg: DAOstrat\n- Calendly: [Link](https://calendly.com/daostrat/balancer-deployment-proposal-on-linea)",

        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/537\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDiscord: overnight-fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time. Our token has a cross-chain functionality with the help of Axelar.\n>\n>\n> Launch Price: $20\n> Presale Price: $20\n> OVN Tokenomics: [Overnight Tokenomics ($OVN)](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/overnight-tokenomics)\n> Presale Information: [Overnight Presale Information](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/ovn-presale)\n> 25% of OVN from Private Presale unlocked on Oct 2. and the remaining 75 will be linearly vested for 4 weeks.\n>\n>  Additional Information:\n> - We cancelled public presale and just used the money raised from private presale to bootstrap liquidity on DEXes. \n> - We have launched at 20m FDV.\n> - We are already live on Aerodrome and Velodrome Finance. We also incentivized huge amount of bribes on Aerodrome (7400$) and Velodrome ($5,700) (For Sept. 28 - Oct. 5)\n> - We have also provided 22.5k OP for our Beefy Boost Program that will be distributed in over 2 weeks.\n> \n> - The rate providers was also reviewed by the integrations team and deemed safe.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n> \n> We aim to create a competitive environment that rewards participation and ensures the most efficient allocation of resources. We believe that veBAL voters are sophisticated and discerning and they will prioritize the community’s best interest. Complexity is often a byproduct of innovation. Our past experiences teach us valuable lessons, enabling us to build more robust systems.\n> \n> While 80/20 pools have been associated with locking, the beauty of the DeFi space is its adaptability. Our objective is to leverage the pool structure for its inherent benefits, not merely conform to traditional use-cases. The goal is to amplify liquidity and ensure stability, rather than exploit emissions. We’re using the pool to its fullest potential to cater to the evolving needs of the market. As also noted, the proposed bribe per week represents a significant boost in Aura’s bribe market, should all bribes be channeled in here.\n> \n> The absence of a defined market cap or trading history doesn’t undermine the intrinsic value of the coin or its future adoption potential. The proposed gauge allocation, especially the 2% caps, is informed by a forward-looking strategy, ensuring that it aligns with the expected bribes and accrued yield.\n> \n> The gauge allocation is in recognition of the potential this new coin brings. Traditional metrics, like trading history, might not fully capture the inherent value and projected adoption. We’re operating in a rapidly evolving landscape; hence, a forward-looking approach is crucial. Coingecko’s preview status doesn’t reflect the groundwork and strategic partnerships that underscore this project.\n> \n> The proposal aims to push the boundaries, capitalize on new opportunities, and ensure the best outcome for the community. We trust the veBAL voters to recognize the merit and long-term vision of this initiative.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/519\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time.\n\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? No\n> 3. **Audits:** [Audits](https://docs.overnight.fi/advanced/audits)\n> * [Hacken Audit (Feb 3, 2022) - App](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-app/blob/master/audits/hacken_2022-02-03.pdf)\n> * [Hacken Audit (Feb 3, 2022) - Core](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-core/blob/master/audits/hacken_2022-02-03.pdf)\n> * [Ackee Audit (Mar 3, 2023)](https://github.com/ovnstable/ovnstable-core/blob/master/audits/ackee_2023-03-03.pdf)\n>\n> 4. **Market History:**\n> Overnight Pulse on Beethoven [Beethoven X | Overnight Pulse ](https://op.beets.fi/pool/0xb1c9ac57594e9b1ec0f3787d9f6744ef4cb0a02400000000000000000000006e)\n> Overnight Pulse on Balancer Arbitrum [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x519cce718fcd11ac09194cff4517f12d263be067000000000000000000000382)\n>\n> 5. **Value:** The pool is expected to generate trading volumes and fees for Balancer.The proposed OVN/wUSD+ pool aims to be a primary source of liquidity for both tokens, enhancing the stability and depth of the market on Balancer.

MaticX is a liquid token for Matic staking built by StaderLabs, a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider with ~770 mn $ in TVL. The incentivization of the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer will help:\n\n1. Build deep liquidity would be a prerequisite to make staked Matic truly liquid in the Polygon Defi ecosystem and incentives would be an important mechanism to aid this\n2. Establish Balancer as the prime DEX for Matic <> MaticX pool. Two reasons why this is important:\n  1. $3 bn in assets locked in polygon staking currently that is set to be unlocked by liquid staking solutions like MaticX\n  2. With its metastable pool technology, Balancer is best placed to serve Matic <> MaticX\n\n**# References/Useful links**\n\n<Restricted due to 2 links due to posting restrictions.

We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera.\n\nWithin a few months of launch, Stader has more than 770 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform.\n\n1. ~ $700 M+ Luna staked\n2. ~$60 M+ HBAR staked\n3. Over 40k+ users staking with Stader smart contracts\n\nStader Protocol’s native token is the SD Token, and we have incentivized liquidity pools on other DEXes by giving out rewards in SD tokens (listed on coin gecko). \n\n*About MaticX:*\n\nMaticX is a liquid token that users get when they stake their Matic with Stader. The MaticX tokens are a representation of users’ staked Matic. They allow users to swap them at a later date for their staked Matic and accrued rewards with Stader. Meanwhile, they will be able to use it on multiple protocols on Polygon to participate in DeFi. MaticX is an ERC20 token.\n\nSafety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard user’s funds. MaticX contracts have been audited successfully by two reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. \n\n**Motivation**\n\nAdding incentivization to the Matic<>MaticX pool on Balancer will help unlock the large liquidity currently locked in staked Matic for the Polygon and Balancer community and in the process, bring significant liquidity and trading volumes to the Balancer ecosystem\n\n* Liquid staking is large and MaticX aims to be the primary liquid staking token for Polygon:\n  * Staking on polygon currently has ~3bn $ of assets staked. Liquid staking can help unlock a large part of this for use in the Defi ecosystem making this an asset class of interest to the Polygon and Balancer communities\n  * Stader’s experience in building strong liquid staking solutions on multiple chains, especially Terra and Hedera, with ~770 mn$ in TVL makes it one of the leading candidates to help unlock this liquidity through MaticX\n  * MaticX is off to a strong start within a few weeks of launch with staking TVL for Matic already at 2.5+ Million Matic. We also recently launched staking on the Polygon Mainnet directly (Polygon's staking protocol is native to Ethereum, so Stader Polygon v1 only supported staking Matic on Ethereum) and this will help increase staking penetration and in turn, MaticX\n  * We will build deep liquidity for MaticX to truly enable users to unlock their staked assets and participate in Defi on Polygon. The MaticX <> Matic LP is already live on Quickswap and has a liquidity of around 5 million USD with average daily trading volume of $246,333 in the last 7 days (Apr 27-May 3)\n  * We expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon (currently only 14,000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon)\n* Balancer is best suited to provide deep liquidity for Matic<>MaticX given its unique metastable pool technology, a great fit for liquid staking assets\n\n**Other Specifications**\n\nGauge: 0xf01541837CF3A64BC957F53678b0AB113e92911b\n\n* Balancer Pool Address: https://polygon.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xc17636e36398602dd37bb5d1b3a9008c7629005f0002000000000000000004c4\n\nWe would like to hear feedback and update any specific information/ parameters as suggested by the Polygon and Balancer community",

[relinquished its responsibilities of all marketing-related work](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-april-2023-high-level-updates/4735) and has since [released all marketing personnel](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-updated-q2-budget-forecast-5-12-23/4775). These actions created a void wherein a critical service essential for the Balancer ecosystem ceased to exist almost overnight.\n\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition and mitigate any harm to the Balancer brand, Beethoven X contributors have activated significant resources to allow us to step in to fill the gap in the domain of marketing/content and are now running the marketing efforts at Balancer.\n\nApril 26: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-balancer-marketing-analysis/4705/14?u=jedirasta26\nMay 4: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/beethoven-x-marketing-update/4731?u=jedirasta26\nMay 19: https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bi-weekly-marketing-update-beethoven-x/4797?u=jedirasta26\n\nAs our initial budget did not account for the significant amount of additional work we’ve undertaken over the course of the last month, this proposal seeks to amend BIP-254 in the following ways:\n\n1. Increase funding for marketing/content-related efforts from $15k to $30k per month starting June 1.\n2. In an attempt to answer community concerns around having service providers that are “too big,” we will split marketing and technical services into two distinct service provider proposals moving forward. Passage of this proposal would additionally remove the marketing budget from BIP-254.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\nOver the past 3 months, the marketing efforts to support Orb were focused on the following key areas:\n\n* Developer Landing Page\n* Content and Education\n* Social Media Presence\n\nHowever, in light of the transitions of the Orb marketing team, our efforts over the past month have shifted focus and have been put towards building a foundation to adequately fill the role previously occupied by Orb. To achieve this we have established the following:\n\n* We have defined a strategy for content creation that is focused on highlighting current developments in the Balancer ecosystem.\n* We are attending weekly meetings with [@Solarcurve](https://forum.balancer.fi/u/solarcurve) and Maxis to make sure that content is relevant and closely aligned with BD efforts.\n* We have created a notion-based system to organize, develop, and schedule content coming out on social media channels and share with all relevant contributors.\n* We established a baseline cadence for content coming out on Twitter.\n* We have built a base layer of visual assets to support all of the content copy.\n* We have begun to develop a distinctive voice/style to authentically represent the Balancer brand.\n* We have been working closely with Balancer’s lead designer [@uxui](https://forum.balancer.fi/u/uxui) to develop an aesthetic for the Balancer brand/social media presence.\n* We have connected with the Balancer community contributors to begin to define a working relationship, support their contributions and build a framework for future collaboration.\n* We have continued to work on the developer landing page.\n* We have furthered our relationship with Aura to closely align on the Balancer brand direction and over-arching marketing strategy.\n\nNow that a baseline has been built, our focus moving forward is to showcase Balancer as a highly relevant and flourishing ecosystem. Leveraging our current expertise and familiarity with the ecosystem/tech alongside support from key contributors from the Balancer DAO we aim to achieve this by working on 4 key areas:\n\n1. Social Media\n2. Core Growth Pillars\n3. Brand Development\n4. Long-Term Initiatives\n\nBelow we have outlined the intention for these initiatives with relevant KPIs for their measurement/success.\n\n1.Social Media: Twitter is the main point of visibility for the content coming through Balancer and as such it will remain a major priority for our marketing efforts. To continue to build relevancy for the Balancer brand and increase our reach we will be working on the following:\n\n  * Consistent threads focused around the core growth pillars identified with BD.\n  * Building rapport with key partners in the space to increase network effect.\n  * Refining Balancer's visual style and tone of voice.\n  * The inclusion of visual forms of educational content.\n  * Community initiatives and a focus on increasing engagement.\n\nKPIs: To measure growth across Twitter we will use the following metrics on a bi-monthly basis. Our hope is to see these figures trend upward over time.\n\n \n![beetsM1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreig4ilgccqfynilp635t7m2ote2ng4ya4n7djlgnzxke7fekecgncm)\n    \n\n\n2.Core Growth Pillars: Re-establishing “relevancy” has been identified as an area that will be critical for the future growth of Balancer’s ecosystem. The following narratives have been outlined as highly relevant to Balancer's success:\n\n  * ve8020\n  * LST’s\n  * Boosted Pools\n  * Building on Balancer\n\nWith these core growth pillars identified, our goal is to curate content focused on bringing these pillars to the forefront of users' attention. We aim to achieve this in the following way:\n\n* Focus marketing efforts around highlighting the vast benefits of the ve8020 model. Showcase successful case partner studies with statistics and growth metrics, as well as build out a ve8020 initiative pack to further educate, onboard, and align new participants.\n* Continue to highlight the unique technology that sets Balancer apart for hosting and facilitating the growth of Liquid Staked Tokens.\n* Showcase the power and effectiveness of Boosted Pools for facilitating ecosystem-wide growth.\n* Provide content and material for builders to onboard into the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nKPIs:\n\n* Ve8020: With a push for the adoption of ve8020 we would like to see the number of protocols adopting this governance model increase over the rest of the quarter. Currently, 8 protocols have embraced the initiative, we would like to see this number increase to 15+ protocols by Q3.\n\n* LST dominance: Since Shapella, we have seen LST liquidity on Ethereum rise week after week, with total ETH staked up over 4 million since April. Throughout the next quarter, we expect this to continue to increase with Liquid Staked protocols directly impacted by an influx of capital. With an innovative tech stack tailored to facilitate the growth of Liquid Staked liquidity, Balancer is uniquely positioned to become the dominant hub for these YB asset types. The goal is to see every LST hosted on Balancer increase in % by the start of Q3.\n\n \n![beetsM2.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiapq5p773dkibw67p4uej63jr4bwiqsm2irnvblxcfxzitapkp34q)\n    \n\n* Building on Balancer: At the start of our service provider contract we had begun work on a developer-focused landing page. However, during the transition of Orb this project has seen less attention as our focus shifted to building a baseline for operations. With a baseline now in place, the goal for the next 3 months is to have completed a beta version of the Landing Page for the community to test out.\n\n3.Brand Development: One of the major areas identified as having potential for improvement has been the overall design and UX for Balancer. Working closely with lead designer Pon, we have been exploring different avenues for how this could be achieved.\n\n  Over the coming months, we hope to bring to life all of the conceptual work we have done by working on the following:\n\n  * Curate and present to the community 2-3 refined brand aesthetics with UX/UI prototypes.\n  * Build out the Balancer developer landing page integrating new brand aesthetic.\n  * Incorporate new look and feel into Twitter and content-related efforts.\n\n4.Long-Term Initiatives\n\nBelow we have outlined 2 long-term marketing goals.\n\n1.Education (Balancer Media Hub)\n\nThe Balancer Media Hub aims to create a central hub dedicated to curating high-quality, engaging content for the Balancer ecosystem. Articles, Videos, and Podcasts, all on one site. With a tech stack uniquely positioned to educate users on a plethora of different DeFi topics, the Balancer Media Hub has the potential to onboard the next wave of DeFi participants. The primary motivations for the development of the media hub are to:\n\n* Facilitate the widespread adoption of users into Balancer/DeFi\n* Create a space where educational content is accessible, fun, and engaging.\n* Continue to push the evolution of the Balancer marketing department\n* Build a foundation for the community to contribute to the growth and education of Balancer.\n* Make sure that we stay not only relevant but “ahead of the curve” moving into the future.\n\n2.Community Development\n\nWe are strong believers in grassroots movements and want to encourage community contributions in our marketing efforts. Our aim would be to foster community content creators to contribute towards the larger efforts of education in DeFi. By incentivizing users with innovative financial gamification mechanisms, we could create an initiative that would provide a platform for community members to showcase content relevant to the ecosystem in the following ways:\n\n* Serve as a space of development for engaged community members and a space of inspiration for aspiring members.\n* Introduce structures of gamification that add to participation and interaction within our community dynamic.\n* Provide a framework for engagement that would have an effect on both visibility and education.\n* Create a network of trust which allows the community to thrive.\n* Potentially integrate into the Balancer Media hub to help scale community contributions\n\n**Deprioritization of PR and Live Events:**\n\nThis is an area that previously received a significant amount of resources from the Orb marketing team. While we value the potential upside this type of marketing can bring, we feel that the cost-benefit doesn’t justify the continuation of these efforts. For the time being, we have chosen to sunset these domains for our marketing strategy and will instead focus on the areas described above. This means that we will not be actively pursuing PR-related activity or officially organizing/attending live events as part of our service provider contributions.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nFor the services described above, we are requesting an increase in the current funding outlined in BIP-254 for marketing-related efforts from $15k per month to $30k per month starting from June 1, 2023, until July 31, 2023.\n\nAs part of this proposal, we would also like to make a formal revision to BIP-254. Presently, we offer both technical and non-technical services to the Balancer ecosystem under one service provider proposal. If accepted by the Balancer community, the passing of this proposal would split our services into 2 distinctive proposals; one service provider contract for technical services and another for marketing services. Moving forward this would mean that we will always request marketing budget changes/renewals separately, and any complaints/objections for marketing services would be treated as separate issues from the technical services provided.\n\nAs these funds will be used to cover contributor salaries, we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form. If approved, $30,000 USDC or BAL equivalent would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",
