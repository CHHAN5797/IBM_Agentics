        "body": "title: GHO Facilitator Onboarding Process and Application\nauthor: @oneski22, @khan\ndescription: A process for prospective GHO Facilitators to apply to be onboarded into the GHO deployment operated by the Aave DAO\ncreated: 2023-03-24\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal aims to enact a new governance process by which interested parties may apply to the Aave DAO to have addresses be onboarded as GHO Facilitators. The authors propose a process by which interested parties publish an application to the Aave Forum (governance.aave.com 1), after a period of discussion and comment, an offchain vote is taken using Snapshot. Should that temperature check vote be successful, an on-chain vote targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor will formally add the address and its initial cap to the GHO system as a facilitator. This post outlines the process in detail, an addition includes 2 sample applications for each of the facilitators Aave Companies has released publicly, Aave V3 & Flash Minter.\n\n## Motivation\nThe GHO Stablecoin Protocol will be governed by the Aave DAO, specifically the Aave DAO Short Executor. There are 3 new processes that the Aave DAO will need to implement:\n\n- a process for facilitator onboarding\n- a process for adjustment of a facilitator limit\n- a process for facilitator offboarding.\n\nThis document only intends to address the first of these processes.\n\n## Implementation\nThe Facilitator onboarding process will begin with a post on the Aave Governance Forum (governance.aave.com 1) conforming to the template below. Next, a 7 day discussion period will commence for the community to ask questions. After the discussion period a snapshot temperature check can be posted on Snapshot. The standard snapshot process with an informal quorum of 320,000 votes is suggested to ensure sufficient community input is received and to keep consistency with existing governance processes. Should the temperature check be successful, another discussion period of 7 days will commence for the community to further refine the proposal. The authors hope that during this second period technical and risk contributors especially provide feedback on the proposed facilitator design, terms of the credit line and the initial GHO limit being requested. Following this second discussion period, an on-chain proposal targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor can then be posted via the Aave DAO Governance contracts to formally on-board the facilitator with its initial GHO limit.\n\n## Specification\nFOR - Adopt this process for onboarding GHO Facilitators\n\nNAE - Do not adopt this process for onboarding GHO Facilitators\n\nABSTAIN - Abstain\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n## Facilitator Application Template\n### Background\n- Title of Facilitator\n- High Level Description of Mechanism / Request\n- Author / Link to License\n- Link to whitepaper (if applicable)\n- How Facilitator Furthers GHO\n- Organization / DAO responsible for operation of the Facilitator (if applicable)\n- History, Details, Background of the operator of the Facilitator (if applicable)\n### Credit Line Details\n- Requested Facilitator Cap\n- Cap Increase Roadmap (if applicable)\n- Use of Funds\n- Revenue Streams\n- Revenue Split / Interest Terms\n- Collateral Posted\n- Other Commercial Details/Considerations\n### Mechanism & Risk Details\n- Detailed Description of the Facilitator\n- How Facilitator is backing GHO\n- If RWA - description of legal structure etc\n- Detail any / all risks (Oracle risk, Third-party Dependencies, Contract risk, Cross-chain, Bridging, Regulatory, etc) as well as any prevention/mitigation methods\n### Governance Controls\n- List of controls given to Aave DAO\n- Controls given not to Aave DAO\n- Alternative controls / roles that may be present but not set (optimistic governance? Risk Admin?

Upon implementation of this upgrade, via a successful Snapshot vote, assets can no longer be add/introduced to the Aave v2 deployments.  \n\n**Note: The Aave ARC & Centrifuge RWA markets, which are powered by the \"Permissioned\" V2 codebase are not included. These liquidity pools support the latest battletested version of the \"Permissioned\" code base.**\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal seeks to begin the transition from v2 to v3 deployments. The first step in this progression is to focus our efforts on growing the v3 deployments whilst continuing to actively support the v2 deployments in all other areas. Going forward all future asset listings are to be limited to only v3 deployments.\n\nSuccessful passing of this ARFC will indicate the DAO has decided that the various V3 deployments are the future of the Aave DAO, and support of the various listed markets will be limited to Risk and Critical Technical Updates. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe Aave Community upon successfully voting on Snapshot to implement this upgrade, will prevent any further assets from being added to any of the following Aave Market pools<!--deployments-->, as identified by their LendingPool Addresses.\n\n- Ethereum V1 Market [0x398eC7346DcD622eDc5ae82352F02bE94C62d119](https://etherscan.io/address/0x398eC7346DcD622eDc5ae82352F02bE94C62d119)\n- Ethereum V1 Uniswap Market [0x2F60C3EB259D63dcCa81fDE7Eaa216D9983D7C60](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2F60C3EB259D63dcCa81fDE7Eaa216D9983D7C60)\n- Ethereum V2 Market [0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d2768de32b0b80b7a3454c06bdac94a69ddc7a9)\n- Ethereum V2 AMM Market [0x7937d4799803fbbe595ed57278bc4ca21f3bffcb](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7937d4799803fbbe595ed57278bc4ca21f3bffcb)\n- Polygon V2 Market [0x8dff5e27ea6b7ac08ebfdf9eb090f32ee9a30fcf](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x8dff5e27ea6b7ac08ebfdf9eb090f32ee9a30fcf)\n- Avalanche V2 Market [0x4F01AeD16D97E3aB5ab2B501154DC9bb0F1A5A2C](https://snowtrace.io/address/0x4F01AeD16D97E3aB5ab2B501154DC9bb0F1A5A2C) \n\nReferences: [Aave v1 Docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/1.0/deployed-contracts), [Aave v2 Docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/v/2.0/deployed-contracts/deployed-contracts)\n\nThis represents the first progression toward deprecating the v1 & v2 deployments across all networks.\n\n# Implementation\n\nCriteria for a success Snapshot vote, the Short Executor criteria must be met:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-11-26 at 16.51.26|548x500](upload://ksUc419zJLE3IBmWhkLxx4YQG2N.png)\n\nReference: https://docs.aave.com/governance/aips\n\nA Snapshot will be created on the 30th November with the vote commencing on the 1st December.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

New assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nSince Gauntlet began its partnership with the Aave protocol, we have received requests from the Community to analyze asset listings. Community members, developers, and other stakeholders often asked us questions like, \"how much liquidity should this asset have before being listed? What should the asset's initial parameters be? How do we protect the protocol from insolvency?\" \n\nGauntlet's framework focuses specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Aave. Our framework can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3). This will work in conjunction with [Aave's existing asset listing framework](https://docs.aave.com/governance/guides/new-asset-listing). \n\nListing assets is essential to the growth of the protocol. As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor, Aave must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol. Gauntlet will conduct these risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in.\n\nNotably, we recommend that LTV and Liquidation Threshold be set to 0% on the initial listing. In other words, assets will not be allowed to be used as collateral upon their initial listing. \n\nHistorically, the community has listed assets with non-zero LTV and Liquidation Threshold. Because there are risks in doing so, this Snapshot vote helps the community align on best practices moving forward.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nCommunity input is valuable because requiring that assets are listed with an initial LTV of 0% imposes important trade-offs:\n\n1. Not requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can potentially allow the asset to have more utility (depending on the asset) from the onset of listing. Thus, the protocol may be earning revenue at the onset of the listing (driven by increased borrows). However, when assets are enabled as collateral from the initial listing, the protocol immediately faces the technical and market risks inherent in adding another risk vector to the protocol. The protocol is only as strong as its weakest link.\n2. Requiring assets to be listed with an initial LTV of 0% can protect the protocol from unforeseen mechanism, smart contract, and other technical risks. In addition, setting an initial LTV of 0% allows the protocol to observe how supply and borrow usage as well as liquidity conditions evolve following the asset listing. This data enables more robust risk analysis and fine-tuning of LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters following the initial asset listing. The tradeoff is that until an asset is enabled as collateral, usage may be limited (depending on the asset), and thus, the protocol faces an opportunity cost of revenue. We view this as a minuscule opportunity cost (e.g., a few weeks of revenue attributable to the asset) relative to the risks. Assets can be turned on as collateral, but being turned off as collateral is a more difficult process with increased user friction.\n\n\nOption 1 above should not be interpreted as suggesting that all assets should be enabled as collateral. It simply allows for the possibility that assets can be listed with an initial non-zero LTV should the community deem the asset a collateral asset.\n\nShould the community favor Option 2, assets should be listed with an initial LTV of 0%, and a separate proposal must be proposed by the community at some point after the initial listing to enable the asset as collateral. At that point in time, given strong community buy-in, Gauntlet will conduct market risk analysis to recommend LTV and Liquidation Threshold parameters.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n\n* This Snapshot vote has the below options:\n1. Not all assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%.\n2. All assets are required to be listed with an initial LTV of 0%. After 2-3 weeks of operation as a non-collateral asset, the community can propose turning it on as collateral. At that point, Gauntlet will make parameter recommendations as per our Notion document below.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Quick Links\n[Gauntlet Asset Listing Framework for Market Risk](https://www.notion.so/gauntlet/Aave-Asset-Listing-Framework-Market-Risk-7c29d448924f444abfa9681410c707c3)\n\n\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

        "body": "Title: [ARC] Risk Parameter Updates for Ethereum Aave v2 Market\nauthor: @MarcZeller @MatthewGraham @Llamaxyz \ncreated: 20-08-2022\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nIn response to Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by FEI borrowers to the Reserve Factor.\n\n## Abstract\n\nTribe DAO is dissolving the DAO’s assets and TRIBE governance token. As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI.\n\nAs FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEI’s circulating supply and liquidity will also fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market.\n\nIn response to recent events, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. A separate forum post will emerge that recommends all aFEI be redeemed for FEI and swapped for DAI via the contracts deployed by Tribe DAO.\n\nThis proposal is to disable lending and borrowing of FEI whilst enabling existing debt to be repaid and collateral to be withdrawn.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI lending market in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state.\n\nThe details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475).\n\nAs FEI will be redeemed for DAI, the stablecoin will suffer diminishing liquidity and diminishing supply. This renders the FEI stablecoin not suitable as a supported asset on Aave markets.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe recommendation is to disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor.\n\n**Risk Parameters:**\n\nFreeze the FEI market which will:\n\nBorrowing Enabled → Disable \nLending Enabled → Disable \n\nAlso,\n\nReserve Factor 20% → 100%\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 24th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to modify FEI risk parameters as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Add LUSD to Ethereum V3 Market\n\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative\n\nDated: 2023-01-31\n\n# Simple Summary\nThis proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard LUSD to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by the Liquity protocol. For more details about LUSD please refers to [Aave V2 ARC by @TokenBrice ARC: Add support for LUSD (Liquity) 3)\n\nThis ARC is a joint effort with @Llamaxyz to allow a selection of assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3…\n\n# Motivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Liquity or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the initial forum post 1 discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same than for LUSD in V2. for now the ACI is supportive to onboard LUSD as it was on V2, when the V3 will be more mature, the ACI is supportive to work on AIP to allow usage of LUSD as a collateral.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\n# Specification\nTicker: LUSD\n\nContract Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0#code\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\tN/A\nBorrow Cap\t1,210k\nSupply Cap\t3,000k\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t80%\nSlope2\t87%\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
