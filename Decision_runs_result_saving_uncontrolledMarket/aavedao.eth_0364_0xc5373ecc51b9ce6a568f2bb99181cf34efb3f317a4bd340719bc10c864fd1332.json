At this time, the total circulating supply on Avalanche is 1,731 WBTC.e. A  considerable portion, nearly 67%, of the circulating supply is concentrated on Aave Avalanche V2 and V3, with ~496 and ~664 tokens, respectively. \n\nGiven the persistence of this trend, we suggest reducing exposure on Aave and proactively modifying risk parameters for the asset. This strategy aims to:\n\n1.  Avert a potential scenario where there is inadequate liquidity to facilitate liquidations in Aave deployments.\n2. Motivate new and existing users on Aave to transition to BTC.b, which has a stronger liquidity profile on Avalanche.\n\n### Limit New Supply\n\nFreeze the WBTC.e reserves on V2 and V3 Avalanche.\n\n### Reduce Capital Efficiency\n\nAdditionally, as a precautionary measure and to further reduce exposure to the asset, we recommend reducing LTs and LTV, without impacting current holders:\n\n- V3 - reduce LT to 70 % and LTV to 0.\n- V2 - reduce LT to 70% and LTV to 0.\n  - at this time, this will lead to 6 accounts totaling $15 to be liquidated.\n\n# Specification\n\n### V3 Avalanche\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |\n| WBTC.e | LTV | 70% | 0% |\n| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |\n\n### V2 Avalanche\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current  | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC.e | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 70% |\n| WBTC.e | LTV | 60% | 0% |\n| WBTC.e | Freeze Reserve | NO | YES |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to increase the debt ceiling of MKR on V3 Ethereum\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum, set at $6M, has reached 100% utilization. \n\nGiven current market conditions and improved liquidity for MKR on Ethereum over the past months, our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling for MKR to $8.5M. \n\nIt is important to note that the majority of MKR debt positions are concentrated within two accounts, accounting for over 80% of the total debt, as outlined below. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0) -  borrowing $3.11M DAI against his 5,914 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 52% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2. [0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05) -  borrowing $1.84M USDC against his 4,077 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 31% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 2.06.\n\n## Specification:\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | Debt Ceiling | 6,000,000 | 8,500,000 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

This change will effectively remove any yield for depositors of these assets, thereby discouraging their supply.\n\n### Increase Borrow Rates:\n\nTo encourage the repayment of borrowed assets, we propose raising the borrow rates across V2 frozen assets. This will be achieved by creating a constant borrow rate up to the currently set UOptomal configuration. Accordingly, we put forward the following options for the community to choose from:\n\n**Moderate (Chaos Recommendation):**\n\n1. Set Base Rate at 20%\n2. Set Slope1 at 0%\n3. Set Slope2 at 300%\n\n**Aggressive:**\n\n1. Set Base Rate at 40%\n2. Set Slope1 at 0%\n3. Set Slope2 at 300%\n\nAfter these changes are put into effect, we'll evaluate their influence on loan repayments and, if necessary, offer additional recommendations. Future updates could involve further hikes in borrow rates and adjustments to the UOptimal points.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur RF | Rec RF | Cur Base | Rec Base | Cur Slope1 | Rec Slope1 | Cur Slope2 | Rec Slope2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1INCH | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| BAL | 35% | 99.90% | 5% | 20% / 40% | 27% | 0% | 150% | 300% |\n| BAT | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| CRV | 30% | 99.90% | 3% | 20% / 40% | 17% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| CVX | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| DPI | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| ENJ | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| ENS | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| MANA | 50% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| MKR | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| REN | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| SNX | 45% | 99.90% | 3% | 20% / 40% | 15% | 0% | 100% | 300% |\n| UNI | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| xSUSHI | 50% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| YFI | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| ZRX | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| KNCL | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 8% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| UST | 20% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| AMPL | 10% | 99.90% | 1% | 20% / 40% | 3% | 0% | 750% | 300% |\n| RAI | 20% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 4% | 0% | 75% | 300% |\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for CRV on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing our recommendations to decrease Aave’s exposure to CRV on V2 Ethereum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31), we propose a series of LT and LTV reductions. The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum. \n\nGiven the current conditions and protocol usage, we propose 2 options for the community to vote on:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-CRV-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-7-10-32dc4ed994be4029b05af831ce5ea537).\n2. “Moderate” - 3% reduction. This option is aligned with the previous reduction and the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nIn the table below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. \n\n| Option | Liquidation Threshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Moderate | 52 | 3 | $46 |\n| Aggressive | 49 | 5 | $116 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 55 | 52 / 49 | -3% / -6% |\n| CRV | LTV | 49 | 46 / 43 | -3% / -6% |\n\n*Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the “aggressive” and “moderate” options*\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) for CRV on Aave V3 Polygon.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs the market liquidity of CRV has seen a substantial decline, this proposal seeks to address this by decreasing the liquidation threshold (LT) for CRV on Polygon V3. The objective is to mitigate the risk exposure associated with CRV and diminish its borrowing power, thereby aligning it more accurately with the existing market conditions and its parameters on other deployments.\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Analysis\n\nChaos Labs recommends a 15% reduction. As of October 25, seven total accounts amounting to ~$141 are at risk of liquidation following the proposed changes.\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | 65% | 50% | 141 | 8 |\n\nList of affected accounts:\n\n| Account | Total Supply (USD) | Total CRV Supplied | Total Borrows (USD) | Health | Health After Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0x9ce21324617b6b573e75d28580dcd5a88c41b4bb | 106 | 29.16 | 86.47 | 1.01 | 0.99 |\n| 0xa21fa160a63993d06daf2cb22f66b9a118a25ed4 | 97 | 200.43 | 59.14 | 1.07 | 0.83 |\n| 0xf36375ef8ef450476541f6326631cac44f9f0a49 | 58 | 40.18 | 41.22 | 1.07 | 0.99 |\n| 0xe9784ffc614fe5cc57939cc7b21cdd2cf8f61c86 | 17 | 34.88 | 10.60 | 1.09 | 0.86 |\n| 0x6c62b64c4e1a4702a41c47d5cdafc29fcba0ebad | 12 | 25.77 | 6.63 | 1.23 | 0.95 |\n| 0xdb79b400a31997ebc6816f002f2b622fe186056a | 12 | 25.57 | 6.63 | 1.22 | 0.94 |\n| 0x0906f3f07c7211bdce20d8a7cf9bdd7c3306532d | 4 | 6.7 | 2.65 | 1.14 | 0.96 |\n| 0x304481771f4922b60a759ac363da3a7da6372cc1 | 4 | 0.83 | 3.5 | 1.02 | 1.00 |\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 65% | 50% | -15% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs have not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
