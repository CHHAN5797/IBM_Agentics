        "body": "## Proposal\nWormhole is a leading cross-chain interoperability protocol, allowing generic messaging over 22 heterogenous blockchains 1 and soon to be many more.\n\nSince launch on mainnet in August 2021, 160 million messages have been transmitted with 2 million messages 1 currently generated a day between asset transfers and messaging. The sheer load of messages that Wormhole processes in a 24 hour period is comparable to an L1 and signals its high reliability.\n\nWormhole has nineteen guardians comprised of the leading PoS validators 1 who jointly attest to messages. Each guardian holds equal weight in governance and consensus. Wormhole requires over two-thirds of the 19 guardians to gain consensus and pass verification, thus we assume that at least one-third of our guardian set is trustworthy.\n\nHashflow is a decentralized exchange platform designed for interoperability, zero slippage, and MEV-protected trades. Hashflow works by connecting professional market makers directly to traders using a request-for-quote (RFQ) model.\n\nHashflow uses DeFi-native RFQs to fetch quotes from market makers who are responsible for managing liquidity in the pools. Market makers are required to cryptographically sign quotes that remain unchanged for the duration of the trade. This ensures that the price is guaranteed and cannot be front-run or sandwich attacked. It also protects traders against slippage if there is significant price movement between the time it takes to validate the transaction on the source chain and relay the payload on to the destination chain.\n\nHashflow leverages Wormhole’s generalized message-passing to communicate between source and destination chains.\n\nWe propose a custom protocol utilizing Wormhole’s generic messaging for cross-chain communication and Hashflow’s cross-chain DEX to facilitate collateral transfers when backing aTokens (detailed below). Generic messaging unlocks Wormhole as a neutral interoperability layer on which protocols can serve users across most chains today. Wormhole has been integrated with Hashflow, which leverages a request-for-quote (RFQ) model for efficient liquidity provision, depth, and order execution quality. Users request a quote to sell some amount of asset X on the source chain and buy some amount of asset Y on the target chain without incurring slippage on the quoted price. Institutional market makers compete on price and depth for order execution and provide a signed quote to the user, which the user includes as calldata when sending the trade transaction on the source chain. With over $11.75B in lifetime trading volume and aggregate average daily volume of $25M from traders directly using the platform and through the aggregators 1inch Network, Open Ocean, Odos, and Zerion, Hashflow has been battle-tested and is a logical starting choice for these cross-chain collateral transfers. Users pay no trading fees for this cross-chain swap but are responsible for the associated gas fees when bridging their aTokens and might incur an implicit fee in any price-differences between the collateral asset on the source and destination chain. Additionally, Wormhole currently does not charge any fees for token bridging.\n\nPending Aave V3 deployments on the specific L1s/L2s, the protocol can support Aave on Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and BNB. To start, we suggest piloting Portals on Arbitrum as a burgeoning deployment and ecosystem.\n\n## Integration\nA custom protocol (”Protocol”) utilizing Wormhole and Hashflow for a Portals integration could function as follows for a given source and target chain:\n\nUser uses the Protocol front-end built on Wormhole to transfer aTokens to the Protocol contract.\n\nProtocol front-end will fetch a signed quote from Hashflow which will be used as a payload to perform the cross-chain swap\nProtocol front-end will allow the user to review the quote before confirming the transaction\nUser’s aTokens are then escrowed in the Protocol on the source chain.\nFollowing the transfer of aTokens, the source chain Protocol contract calls the withdraw function in the Aave Pool contract on the source chain, which transfers the user’s previously escrowed aTokens from the Protocol contract to the Aave Pool contract and then transfers the user’s underlying collateral from the Aave Pool contract to the Protocol contract.\n\nThe contract then submits the signed quote to Hashflow’s cross-chain router to swap the user’s source-chain native collateral to the target-chain native collateral, sending this collateral to the target chain Protocol contract.\n\nNext, the target chain Protocol contract calls mintUnbacked 2 function in the target chain Aave Pool contract followed by the backUnbacked function to atomically mint aTokens to the user on the target chain and back these aTokens.\n\nTo prevent the collateral risk to the Protocol on the source chain and to allow for seamless atomic liquidations on the target chain, we suggest that Aave prevent users from bridging aTokens used as collateral on the source chain and prevent the use of the unbacked aTokens as collateral on the target chain until they’ve been backed by the bridge.\n\n## Technical Specifications\nIs the entity a Bridge?\n\nWhile users can bridge assets using applications built atop Wormhole, Wormhole is primarily a generic interoperability protocol, enabling users and developers alike to use and build complex, composable applications on top of Wormhole.\nCan anyone provide liquidity to the protocol?\n\nN/A\nIs liquidity incentivized?\n\nNo, at this time liquidity is not incentivized.\nIs there a fee model for participants?\n\nThere are currently no fees when participants use Wormhole.\nDoes the entity plan to provide available liquidity into Aave protocol?\n\nTBD\nLink to analytics dashboard of protocol (Liquidity, assets, networks, volume).\n\nhttps://wormhole.com/stats/ 1\nhttps://wormhole.com/explorer/ 1\nhttps://app.hashflow.com/dashboard\nIf applicable, link to the user-focused dapp of the entity.\n\nhttps://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer\nhttps://wormhole.com/ecosystem/\nhttps://app.hashflow.com/ 1\nLink to technical documentation\n\nhttps://book.wormhole.com/\nhttps://docs.hashflow.com/hashflow/product/bridgeless-cross-chain-swaps\nProposed Portals Asset Minting Caps\nOn all networks that Aave V3 is deployed on and Wormhole supports, we propose conservative Portals minting caps of $0.5M, $1M, and 50 ETH respectively for USDC, USDT, and ETH to begin with but aim to increase this over time subject to governance. The protocol will charge users a nominal 3bps fee to bridge over their aTokens, of which the Aave DAO will be entitled to 50%.\n\nScreenshot 2023-02-22 at 3.27.46 PM\nScreenshot 2023-02-22 at 3.27.46 PM\n1436×168 6.53 KB\nBenefits to AaveDAO\nAave is at an inflection point, with a sizable but closing head-start on its multi-chain deployment and usage. With the launch of V3 on Ethereum, it is timely to pilot Portals, enabling seamless flows of capital from the liquidity hub of Ethereum to the other V3 deployments. For AaveDao’s longterm success, it’s imperative that the DAO fosters these multi-chain deployments while still in the lead as the tight integration of aToken assets into DeFi creates a strong moat. Additionally, with tens to hundreds of millions of TVL and volume in Hashflow and Wormhole, we see Portals as an natural way to onboard Hashflow and Wormhole users into the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Audits & Security\nList of relevant security audits of the Wormhole network\n\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Ethereum Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Solana Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Terra Contracts\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Guardian\nJanuary 2022 - Neodyme 1: Solitaire\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Ethereum Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Solana Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Terra Contracts\nJuly 2022 - Kudelski: Guardian\nAugust 2022 - Kudelski: Algorand Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - OtterSec: NEAR Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - Trail of Bits: Solana Contracts\nSeptember 2022 - Trail of Bits: CosmWasm Contracts\nUnderway audits can be found here\nList of relevant security audits of Hashflow\n\nOctober 2022 - Quantstamp\nOctober 2022 - Certik\nNovember 2022 - OpenZeppelin\nSecurity Properties\n\nThe Wormhole dependency in the implementation above is in the core messaging layer, relying on the standard trust assumption of the PoA consensus with 19 guardians where more than two-thirds are required to reach consensus and verify a message. These guardians are made up of some of the largest and most reputable staking providers in crypto. This level of operational security diversity is a useful property in preventing wholesale compromise of the Guardian Set due to operational failures of a single or small number of organizations. More information on Wormhole security practices can be found here.\n\nHashflow relies on Market Makers for providing quotes, and Wormhole for ensuring that the cross-chain messages are correctly passed. The former is a transparent process (the user can see these quotes ahead of execution), whereas the latter falls back on Wormhole’s security properties.\n\nThe logic of creating new unbacked aTokens on the target chain, withdrawing collateral on behalf of the user on the source chain, and backing users’ unbacked aTokens on the target chain lies in the Aave protocol, falling back on Aave’s security.\n\nHas the Entity experienced outages, downtime, or exploits/hacks? On which Networks?\n\nWe recognize that Wormhole has earned some press for the hack in February of this year. Since then, Wormhole continues to add multiple security layers 1 to help prevent/mitigate the effects of smart contract bugs like the one responsible for that hack:\nThe first of these, Governor, allows each Guardian to set limits on the notional value of any transfer originating on a supported chain within a specified time period. The Governor allows Wormhole Guardians to provide optional value movement protections to token bridges built on Wormhole. This protection allows Wormhole Guardians to govern (or effectively rate-limit) the notional flow of assets from any given token bridge chain. This safety feature allows Guardians to limit the impact of any security issue any given chain may have from affecting other connected chains. The Governor allows the setting of daily limits of notional flow and also has an ability to set a fixed finality delay for transactions over a specific size for each supported chain.\n\nFurther layers of security to prevent incorrect withdrawals of funds is the Cosmos-based Wormhole Chain, which enables Guardians to independently verify if the source chain has sufficient funds to do cross-chain transfers, and an emergency shutdown module, allowing a quorum of Guardians to temporarily pause value movement through Wormhole.\n\nAdditionally, Wormhole has a $2.5M bounty program on Immunefi.",

Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.\n\n# Motivations\nLaunched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):\n\nTotal trading volume: $160B\nTotal swaps: 5.91M\nTotal users: 1.25M\n\n1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.\n\nThe mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.\n\nIn December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.\n\n# Benefits to Aave Community\n\n1INCH is highly liquid.\n1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.\n1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.\n\n# Resources\nWebsite: 1inch.io\nToken: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302 4\nGovernance Forum\nDiscord Chat\nGithub\nDocumentation\nBlog\nTwitter\nCoingecko\nDune analytics\n\n# Specification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\nRoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.\n\n1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.\n\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.\n\nOn the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\n1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.\n\n1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.\n\n1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.\n\nP2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.\n1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.\n\nSupported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.\n\n# How is the asset currently used?\n\n1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3\n\n#Emission schedule\n\nThe 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.\n\nOf the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).\n\nUncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).\n\n# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nThe smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.\n\nThe 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.\n\n# Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $548M circulating, $1.98B FDV\n24h Volume: $50M\nExchanges: CoinGecko | CoinMarketCap\nDEX:\nUniswap V3 1 | $9.9M TVL | $176k 24h Trading Volume\n1inch Liquidity Protocol | $3.4M TVL\nUniswap V2 | $0.5M TVL\n\n# Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nTwitter 2: 1.0M\nDiscord: 15.8k\nTelegram [EN]: 25.9k\nReddit: 7.9k\nGithub\n\n# Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment (Token): Dec-23-2020\nNumber of Transactions: 580k+\nNumber of Holders: 87k\n\n# Risk Factors\n# 1INCH - Risk Assessment\n\n## Smart Contract Risk Counterparty Risk Market Risk Overall Risk\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-04 at 19.47.49.png](ipfs://bafkreie6zbinxzt2fufyo76ha7tb7mbbjwir2mgougsnbgqjg2x7ymiobm)\n    \n\n## General\n\nThe 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.\n\n* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.\n* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.\n* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.\n  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.\n  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.\n  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.\n\nThe 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nDAO Treasury: 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07\n1inch Foundation: 0x5E89f8d81C74E311458277EA1Be3d3247c7cd7D1\n1INCH: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302\nst1INCH: 0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba\nv1INCH: 0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2\nChainlink Oracle: 0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8\n\n## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:\n\nThe 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M\n\nThe 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.\n\nThe 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.\n\nOn April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.\n\nThere is an extensive list of audits available on Github.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nAudits: https://github.com/1inch/1inch-v2-audits\n1inch Genesis: 0x9825b9f083ba43112afd66dbcfbbf770e24bc21ff4128ce24ddbda171d79ae2f\nBurn 1INCH Key Transaction: 0x8799998e32cf58f4939a1fb21b3e679f1cc4598b26b73bfea6f265fa5426d511\n\n## 1INCH Counterparty Risk:\n\n1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program.\n\nThe st1INCH token is used for governing the DAO and although there is no revenue sharing like with xSUSHI there are economic rewards/incentives for those who hold the token. st1INCH token holders receive up to 100% of gas expenses refunded, depending on your stake size. Under this program, 1INCH tokens are distributed as a gas refund to Ethereum users who stake 1INCH tokens through the 1INCH dApp. Borrowing 1INCH with the intent to receive a gas refund is a useful utility.\n\nUsers who stake 1INCH receive st1INCH which is non transferrable and used for governance. If a malicious actor was to borrow 1INCH, stake to receive st1INCH and then try attack the DAO’s treasury, then the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72 hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote. This measure provides a level of protection for the DAO’s Treasury funds which are nominated in USDC. Any malicious attack on the DAO Treasury would not lead to the actor selling 1INCH on-market and this scenario would not create bad debt by moving the spot price of 1INCH.\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n\nRisk parameters can be found on the forum thread linked below.

        "body": "Vote:\nYES = In-favour of listing BTC.b on the Avalanche V3 Market\nNO = Against listing BTC.b on the Avalanche V3 Market\n\n## References\n\nProject: https://www.avax.network/\nDocument portal: https://docs.avax.network 1\nContract addresses: Bitcoin (BTC.b) Token Tracker | SnowTrace 3\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/avalancheavax?s=20&t=PSU83btgvaI0pwbkwO8vCA 1\nTelegram: Telegram: Contact @avalancheavax\nTechnical Documentation: Bridging Bitcoin To Avalanche: A Technical Overview | by Michael Kaplan | Avalanche | Jun, 2022 | Medium\nSupport Documentation: Avalanche Bridge | Avalanche Support\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to list BTC.b as a collateral asset. BTC.b is the bridged version of Bitcoin from the Avalanche Bitcoin bridge.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Avalanche Bridge has become a cornerstone piece of infrastructure for the Avalanche community, introducing an innovative security model that uses Intel SGX technology to usher in a new era of bridge technology. The Bitcoin bridge will allow users to directly on and off-ramp from the Bitcoin network and enable Bitcoin users the chance to participate in DeFi. It is a seamless, easy and secure process.\n\n## Driving Factors\n\nSecure: the bridge must be audited and built with security-first technologies.\nCost-Effective: the cost of bridging assets should be low.\nFast: the transaction should take the least amount of time possible.\nTransparent: users should be informed of the transfer status at every step of the process.\nIntuitive: users new to crypto asset transfers can easily understand the steps to use the bridge.\nSpecifications\n\n### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\nThe author of the AIP is a representative of the Ava Labs team.\n\n### Provide a high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nAva Labs is the servicing firm behind the Avalanche blockchain. Avalanche is a network that is EVM compatible and can scale both vertically and horizontally through the subnet architecture and rollups. Avalanche subnets can also support custom virtual machines and many programming languages.\n\nBTC.b is the Avalanche bridged version of native Bitcoin and is non-custodial and permissionless allowing for one of the best and easiest on/off ramps to the Bitcoin network.\n\n### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good asset to borrow or use as collateral?\n\nBTC.b is redeemable for the native version of BTC and might be the quickest, easiest and safest way to get BTC on-chain. As we have seen in recent times CeFi carries its own risks and BTC.b allows another avenue to get BTC on-chain.\n\nBTC.b is already integrated into multiple DeFi protocols within the Avalanche ecosystem such as Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, Pangolin, Benqi, and Paraswap.\n\n### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nAvalanche’s primary network consisting of its X-Chain, P-Chain, and C-Chain went live a little over a year ago with on-chain protocols launching around that time and since then has not had any downtime. C-Chain is an EVM-compatible contract chain and Avalanche subnets allow for horizontal scaling into a variety of virtual machines and languages.\n\nThe Avalanche Ethereum Bridge is the most popular Ethereum bridge in terms of TVL and the network has become very popular for DeFi, peaking at 2nd or 3rd in terms of TVL only behind Ethereum. Avalanche initially struggled to gain liquidity and traction but Avalanche Rush, Avalanche’s liquidity mining program that took place in the Autumn of 2021, attracted both Ethereum bluechip protocols and thousands of new users. Avalanche also has native stablecoins ensuring some of the bridge risks are taken away.\n\n### How is the asset currently used?\n\nCurrently, there is about $28M worth of BTC.b bridged to Avalanche C-Chain. Some of the top protocols with BTC.b integrated include $30M of liquidity deposited in Platypus Finance, the Avalanche native stableswap, $2.6M of liquidity within the Benqi lending protocol, and $14M of liquidity for the AVAX-BTC.b pair within the AMM Trader Joe.\n\n### Emission schedule\nNo emission schedule\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nThe bridge uses Intel SGX with a total of 8 wardens and the approval structure of 6 of 8. The wardens include Ankr, Blockdaemon, Chainstack, Protofire, Avascan, Ava Labs, Bware Labs, and Halborn. BTC bridging with Avalanche Bridge is not supported with Metamask or any other wallet other than the Avalanche Core Wallet. This is because the Core Wallet Extension was custom built to support Bitcoin and the Avalanche Bridge and to handle the technical problems of linking Bitcoin and EVM chains within a wallet.\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $28M\n24 Hr Volume: $501k\nExchanges: Trader Joe, Platypus Finance, and Pangolin\nCoinGecko: Bitcoin Avalanche Bridged (BTC.b) Price in USD: BTC.B Live Price Chart & News | CoinGecko 1\nSocial channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\nTwitter: 715k followers (https://twitter.com/avalancheavax)\nTelegram: 48k member (Telegram: Contact @avalancheavax)\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of deployment: June 21, 2022\nThe number of transactions: 14,440\nThe number of holders: 408\n\n### How It Works/Technical Specifications\n\nThe Bridge can be broken down into two main parts: the SGX application and a set of third-party indexers and verifiers called “Wardens.” The Wardens are responsible for indexing the Avalanche and Bitcoin blockchains and submitting eligible transactions to the enclave for processing. The SGX application requires 3 of 4 Wardens to submit the same transaction before generating the signed transaction to process the Bridge transfer on the other network. For security reasons, neither the enclave nor the Wardens are directly accessible to bridge users. Instead, they’ll explicitly whitelist each other’s IP addresses for direct communication. In addition, all communication between the Enclave and Wardens will be encrypted and verified using TLS and include an HMAC signature. For relaying information to the Bridge user base, each warden hosts a JSON file containing the current bridge settings, assets requirements, and attestation report. The front end is set to disable itself if there’s any discrepancy within the critical information.\n\n### Proposed Technical Parameters\n\nBTC.b is proposed to start with a 70 percent max LTV, a 75 percent liquidation threshold, and a 6.5 percent liquidation penalty. With the level of on-chain liquidity and the ability to bridge from BTC.b back to native BTC quickly and exchange on centralized exchanges for native Avalanche stablecoins, these parameters are safe.",

        "body": "## Summary\nFull details at: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-new-knc-to-aave-v2-and-v3/8236\n\nKyber Network is a multi-chain crypto trading and liquidity hub that connects liquidity from different sources to enable token trading at the best rates through its main user interface [KyberSwap.com](http://kyberswap.com). As a hybrid DEX aggregator + liquidity platform, it aims to offer the best rates for traders and the best returns for liquidity providers with concentrated liquidity.\n\nKyber Network launched on Ethereum in February 2018 and is a pioneer in the DeFi space, developing one of the earliest decentralized exchanges (DEX) with Vitalik Buterin as an advisor. The team has continued to innovate; spearheading the launch of WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) - the most popular ERC20 version of Bitcoin today, as well as developing amplified liquidity pools on KyberSwap that offers capital efficiency for any token pair. Kyber Network is also part of the pioneer batch of Alliance DAO/DeFi Alliance mentors.\n\nThis proposal aims to list the new version of the [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdeFA4e8a7bcBA345F687a2f1456F5Edd9CE97202) for borrowing and lending and as a collateral asset on both Aave v2 and v3, after [delisting](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2022-03-31/7742) the old KNCL token (previously on Aave).\n\n## Motivations\n\nKyberSwap (Kyber Network’s main swap interface) is one of the oldest and most popular DEX aggregators with close to [1M web visitors per month](https://www.similarweb.com/website/kyberswap.com/#overview) (June 2022). KyberSwap has already been deployed on 12 chains. Total trading volume has crossed $10B+ (combined legacy and new KyberSwap protocol) and current total value locked (TVL) is $63M+.\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on proposals to improve KyberSwap. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap.com and other benefits from ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated.\n\nKNC is a liquid asset with many token holders. KNC holders may want to obtain additional liquidity without selling KNC so that they can still capture potential upside in value. With KNC supported on Aave, KNC holders can borrow funds for a wide variety of DeFi use cases, such as margin trading or for new investment opportunities, all without selling their current holdings.\n\n## Specifications\n\n#### 1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n[shaneMkt](https://twitter.com/shaneMkt) is Head of Strategy for DAO & Tokenomics at Kyber Network.\n\n#### 2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\n**About Kyber Network**\n\nKyber Network is a multi-chain crypto trading and liquidity hub that connects liquidity from different sources to enable token trading at the best rates through its main user interface KyberSwap.com. As a hybrid DEX aggregator + liquidity platform, it aims to offer the best rates for traders and the best returns for liquidity providers. Kyber’s vision is to be the multi-chain liquidity hub for the decentralized economy, where any user or application can easily access the required tokens for their liquidity needs.\n\n**About KNC**\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on [KyberDAO](http://kyber.org) proposals. Important proposals include improvements to KyberSwap, determining the various incentive mechanisms for liquidity providers, and capturing value created by new innovations. In return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap.com and other benefits from ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated.\n\nKNC investors include: Hashed, Signum, ParaFi, HyperChain, and Stake Capital.\n\n**KNC Migration in 2021**\n\nThe old KNCL token was previously approved and added to Aave. In 2021, KNC was upgraded to add additional utility and upgradeability. The old KNC was renamed KNCL (Kyber Network Crystal Legacy) to differentiate it from the new KNC. Since 20 April, 2021, users can migrate their KNCL (ie. convert it) to new KNC through a simple procedure on [Kyber.org](https://kyber.org/migrate).\n\nTop exchanges are already supporting the latest version of KNC. KNC can be obtained on decentralized platforms such as KyberSwap.com as well as centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Crypto.com, OKX, KuCoin, Kraken, Huobi, Gate.io, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bithumb, Upbit, WazirX, and eToro.\n\n* New KNC Announcement: [https://twitter.com/kybernetwork/status/1384504675701952517 1](https://twitter.com/kybernetwork/status/1384504675701952517)\n* Migration Guide: [KNC Token Migration Guide](https://blog.kyber.network/knc-token-migration-guide-fda08bfe62c2)\n\nThere was also recent [ARC proposal by Gauntlet](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2022-03-31/7742) to freeze KNCL (the old legacy token) to make way for the new KNC token on Aave.\n\n#### 3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nKyber Network is a well-known DeFi project and KNC one of the top tokens selected to be part of the [DeFi Pulse Index](https://www.defipulse.com/blog/defi-pulse-index). According to DeFi Pulse, for the top DeFi tokens that were selected, the “associated dApp and founding team must be widely considered legitimate.”\n\n* KNC governs one of the most popular DEX aggregators and liquidity protocols in DeFi which is deployed on 12 chains\n* KNC is a highly liquid token but is still not on many decentralized lending platforms\n* [KNC price feeds](https://data.chain.link/) are supported by Chainlink on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum\n![image](ipfs://bafkreif3fvcatkvdhxnbipynnrai4cly6po74s2powyjuw7ezd4nhpvfma)\n* KNC is already a supported asset on the bridges for BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism\n* KNC has over 10,000 token holders, including crypto VCs and other DeFi projects\n* If it is added to Aave, KNC holders would be able to lend KNC to earn interest instead of selling their tokens\n* By supporting deposits of KNC as collateral, users can borrow stablecoins for other activities\n* KNC holders can borrow KNC for staking and earning rewards, and support governance proposals\n* Kyber team and KyberDAO treasury are considering depositing KNC to borrow stablecoins\n* The old KNCL token had earlier passed Aave’s due diligence and was supported as collateral on Aave\n\n**Risk Matrix** \n*6 Sep 2022*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiatzeeerh5eysfo7tr5pdrjdlemqbhuv763obdr2cb7cvhfe7hg64)\n* [KyberDAO and KNC audit by Hacken](https://hacken.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/04042021_Kyber_SC_Audit_Report.pdf)\n* [KyberSwap audit by ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/kyber-network-dynamic-market-maker-dmm/)\n    \n**Benefits to the Aave Community**\n\n* New KNC is highly liquid but it is not on any major decentralized lending platform. Aave can be the first to support it.\n* Kyber has a large community on our social media channels and can provide marketing support and resources to promote the launch of new KNC on Aave, thereby spreading more awareness about Aave.\n* KNC has over 10,000 token holders, including VCs and other DeFi projects, and they would be able to have a direct use case for their tokens on Aave.\n* Kyber is expanding to a wide variety of chains (already on 12 chains), which is aligned with and can support Aave's expansion efforts to other chains\n* Kyber and Aave have a long history of collaboration and listing new KNC would be another positive step forward in our relationship.    \n\n#### 4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nKyber Network was founded by Victor Tran, Loi Luu, and Yaron Velner in 2017; all 3 founders are well-known researchers in the Ethereum and DeFi community, and Victor and Loi were both Forbes 30 under 30 recipients. Yaron is also the founder of [B.Protocol](https://www.bprotocol.org/) and [Risk DAO](https://riskdao.org/). Since inception, Kyber Network has powered 100+ integrated projects and successfully facilitated over $10 billion in transactions and over a million trades for thousands of users. For example, our main product KyberSwap integrated with leading trading analytics platform [DEXTools](https://www.dextools.io/), enabling millions of users to access KyberSwap’s token pairs at the best rates.\n\nKyberSwap.com currently supports 12 chains including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Cronos, Arbitrum, Optimism, Velas, Aurora, Oasis and BitTorrent. Aggregated TVL from 67+ DEXes is over $40B, with 30,000+ pools and 26,000+ tokens.\n\n**Historical milestones**\n\n1. One of the earliest DEXes and it was developed with advice from Vitalik Buterin\n\n2. Built [Oyente](https://github.com/melonproject/oyente), which was the first automated smart contract verification framework and one of the most used open-source auditing tools by security experts (e.g. Enzyme, Quantstamp)\n\n3. One of the first to use DEX/liquidity pool aggregation on Ethereum by integrating different DEXes\n\n4. Initiated and launched [WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)](https://wbtc.network/) - the most popular ERC20 version of Bitcoin\n\n5. Developed practical decentralized cross-chain bridges between Ethereum and a non-EVM chain (Peace Relay for Bitcoin and Waterloo Bridge for EOS, which inspired the Rainbow bridge for NEAR)\n\n6. First to work with professional market makers for on-chain market making on Ethereum\n\n7. Helped advise and was part of the launch of DeFi Alliance and Asia DeFi Network\n\n8. First to develop amplified pools with high capital efficiency for any token pair, not just stablecoins\n\n11. One of the few hybrid DEX aggregators that not only have our own permissionless liquidity pools, but also sources liquidity from external sources to give the best rates to traders\n\n**Recent KyberSwap Features**\n\n1. DEX Aggregation Algorithm\n\nKyberSwap’s aggregation algorithm aggregates liquidity, automatically searching multiple DEXes to identify and select the optimal trade routes and best prices for users. KyberSwap makes trading more efficient and saves time and money for thousands of users. KyberSwap sources liquidity from over 60 different DEXs such as Uniswap, Sushi, Curve, QuickSwap, Pancakeswap, Traderjoe, Pangolin, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, VVS Finance and many others to achieve the best rates for traders on supported chains.\n\n2. Concentrated/Amplified Liquidity Pools\n\nElastic Pools: Liquidity providers (LPs) can deposit tokens into Elastic pools and earn compounding fees. Pools have customizable price ranges and features such as anti-sniping and **concentrated liquidity** , mimicking higher levels of liquidity and achieving much better capital efficiency, volume, and returns. For example, with the same pool and trade size, stable token pairs with low variability in the price range (e.g. USDC/USDT) can be up to 1000x better compared to other platforms.\n\nAs such, liquidity providers can achieve greater capital efficiency, rates, volume, and returns compared to other platforms. LPs earn more in an efficient manner.\n\nMoreover, LPs earn trading fees that are automatically claimed when you withdraw your liquidity.\n\n3. Trending Soon Analytics\n\nKyberSwap users can view which tokens are [‘Trending’ and ‘Trending Soon’](https://kyberswap.com/#/discover?tab=trending_soon). Tokens displayed under the Trending tab are based on current trending data gleaned from top data aggregators CoinGecko and Coinmarket.\n\nTokens displayed under Trending Soon are detected based on Kyber’s special trend detection algorithm, using trading volume, price, market cap, and other on-chain data.\n\n#### 5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nKNC is Kyber’s utility and governance token, and is an important part of KyberSwap operations. KNC holders can stake KNC to vote on [KyberDAO](http://kyber.org) proposals. Important proposals include improvements to KyberSwap, determining the various incentive mechanisms for liquidity providers, and capturing value created by new innovations.\n\nIn return, KNC voters receive rewards from fees collected through trading on KyberSwap.com and other benefits from ecosystem collaborations. As more trades are executed and new protocols added, more rewards are generated. Over $10M worth of rewards have been distributed to KyberDAO voters over the years.\n\nMore information about KNC can be found here: https://kyber.network/about/knc\n\n#### 6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is currently no automatic emission. All tokens for founders and advisors from the token sale have been distributed since September 2019.\n\n~23M KNC is managed by KyberDAO as part of an ecosystem growth fund to facilitate trade and liquidity mining, and other growth activities.\n\nNew KNC can be minted or burned by KyberDAO, subject to a DAO vote by KNC holders.\n\n#### 7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nKNC is an upgradeable token. The overall architecture for KyberDAO is largely based on Aave’s governance model with some differences/modifications such as the ability to enable the creation and voting of multi-option (generic, non-binary) proposals, and enabling the calculation of KyberDAO voting power based on a system that uses the current KNC staking model.\n\nKNC is dynamic and can be upgraded, minted, or burned by KyberDAO to better support liquidity and growth.\n\nThe DAO has in-built governance safeguards to ensure that any decision or contract alteration will always be preceded by a suitable time period of preparation and reflection, as well as a minimum voter participation threshold. In addition, we have a 5/9 multisig with the role of a DAO operator that assists with operational tasks and ensuring the integrity of the DAO. The multisig comprises a mix of Kyber team members and founders of external DeFi projects with no direct affiliation to Kyber.\n\nReached text limit.

Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.\n\n# Motivations\nLaunched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):\n\nTotal trading volume: $160B\nTotal swaps: 5.91M\nTotal users: 1.25M\n\n1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.\n\nThe mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.\n\nIn December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.\n\n# Benefits to Aave Community\n\n1INCH is highly liquid.\n1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.\n1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.\n\n# Resources\nWebsite: 1inch.io\nToken: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302 4\nGovernance Forum\nDiscord Chat\nGithub\nDocumentation\nBlog\nTwitter\nCoingecko\nDune analytics\n\n# Specification\n1.

Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.\n\n1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.\n\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.\n\nOn the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\n1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.\n\n1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.\n\n1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.\n\nP2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.\n1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.\n\nSupported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.\n\n# How is the asset currently used?\n\n1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3\n\n#Emission schedule\n\nThe 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.\n\nOf the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).\n\nUncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).\n\n# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nThe smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.\n\nThe 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.\n\n# Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $548M circulating, $1.98B FDV\n24h Volume: $50M\nExchanges: CoinGecko | CoinMarketCap\nDEX:\nUniswap V3 1 | $9.9M TVL | $176k 24h Trading Volume\n1inch Liquidity Protocol | $3.4M TVL\nUniswap V2 | $0.5M TVL\n\n# Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nTwitter 2: 1.0M\nDiscord: 15.8k\nTelegram [EN]: 25.9k\nReddit: 7.9k\nGithub\n\n# Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment (Token): Dec-23-2020\nNumber of Transactions: 580k+\nNumber of Holders: 87k\n\n# Risk Factors\n# 1INCH - Risk Assessment\n\n## Smart Contract Risk Counterparty Risk Market Risk Overall Risk\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-04 at 19.47.49.png](ipfs://bafkreie6zbinxzt2fufyo76ha7tb7mbbjwir2mgougsnbgqjg2x7ymiobm)\n    \n\n## General\n\nThe 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.\n\n* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.\n* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.\n* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.\n  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.\n  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.\n  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.\n\nThe 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nDAO Treasury: 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07\n1inch Foundation: 0x5E89f8d81C74E311458277EA1Be3d3247c7cd7D1\n1INCH: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302\nst1INCH: 0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba\nv1INCH: 0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2\nChainlink Oracle: 0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8\n\n## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:\n\nThe 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M\n\nThe 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.\n\nThe 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.\n\nOn April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.\n\nThere is an extensive list of audits available on Github.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nAudits: https://github.com/1inch/1inch-v2-audits\n1inch Genesis: 0x9825b9f083ba43112afd66dbcfbbf770e24bc21ff4128ce24ddbda171d79ae2f\nBurn 1INCH Key Transaction: 0x8799998e32cf58f4939a1fb21b3e679f1cc4598b26b73bfea6f265fa5426d511\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nPlease see the discussion on the governance forum, linked below, for full context on the associated risks for listing 1INCH.  Due to the character limitation of snapshot, a summary of Gauntlet's risk parameters for listing the asset as collaerla on Aave v2 is shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Vaue|\n| --- | --- |\n|Collateral|Yes|\n|Borrowing|Yes|\n|LTV|40%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|50%|\n|Liquidation Penalty|8.5%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|\n|UOptimal|45%|\n|R_0|0%|\n|R_s1|7%|\n|R_s2|300|",
