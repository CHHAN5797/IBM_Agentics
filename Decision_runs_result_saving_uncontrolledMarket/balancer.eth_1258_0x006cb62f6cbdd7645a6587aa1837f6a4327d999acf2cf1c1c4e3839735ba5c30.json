It represents the liquidity of the underlying assets that have been deposited on Kelp. rsETH provides liquidity for the restaked positions, accumulates the rewards, and simplifies rewards management for AVSs\n\nKelp has more than 260,000 ETH worth of assets restaked by over 40,000 users across multiple L2s. All of this is within 4 months of launch\n\nBy providing liquidity for the restaked positions, wrsETH allows for a seamless experience to engage with DeFi activities and maximize rewards.\n\nMotivation:\n\nKelp is seeking to establish the [wrsETH/ETH on Optimism] and on Balancer to further enrich the liquidity of wrsETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Kelp community.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n1. Governance: Kelp currently operates with a multi-sig wallet. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance soon\n\n2. Oracles: Kelp is working with Redstone to create price feeds of rsETH.\n\n3. Audits: Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime and Code4rena.\n\n  1. Sigma Prime Report: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/SigmaPrime.pdf\n  2. Code4rena: [Code4rena | Keeping high severity bugs out of production](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-11-kelp)\n  3. MixBytes: [KELPDAO LRT-ETH SECURITY AUDIT REPORT](https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/mixbytes.pdf)\n\n4. Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\nOur goal is to migrate Kelp away from these vectors.\n\n5. Market History: Kelp has seen meteoric growth in TVL in the last few weeks with TVL over 260k ETH and >40,000 holders of rsETH across mainnet and L2s.\n\nThe balancer pools are already live and are available on Optimism\n\nOptimism pool: https://app.balancer.fi/#/optimism/pool/0x73a7fe27fe9545d53924e529acf11f3073841b9e000000000000000000000133\n\n6. Value: The balancer pool is the 2nd liquidity pool on Optimism and is aimed at providing liquidity to the growing community.\n\nTechnical Specifications:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x65a5C255cfDDb99CAcCaCeE6f0FA63F3AB886e79`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Optimism`",

        "title": "[BIP-644] Enable Gauge for amphrETH/rstETH/Re7LRT/steakLRT/wstETH (Ethereum)",
        "author": "0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516",
        "body": "PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1106\n\n## Summary:\n\nMellow proposes to add a veBAL gauge for the amphrETH/rstETH/Re7LRT/steakLRT/wstETH 5pool on Balancer.\n\nRoot Gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x03ac2920378A51d6CA78813b1d7578Dab08d3760\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\n• Website: https://mellow.finance/\n\n• Documentation: https://docs.mellow.finance/\n\n• Github Public Repo: https://github.com/mellow-finance\n\n• Twitter: https://twitter.com/mellowprotocol\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nMellow LRT is an innovative liquid restaking primitive allowing permissionless creation of modular LRTs. Mellow offers a series of vault smart contracts tailored to different risk profiles, managed by LRT curators. For more information, please see [here](https://docs.mellow.finance/mellow-lrt-primitive/overview).\n\nMellow has more than 41,000 stETH worth of assets restaked across 4 LRTs curated by P2P (rstETH), Steakhouse (steakLRT), re7 (Re7LRT), and MEV Capital (amphrETH). The protocol quickly reached its cap limits after it launched in mid June 2024. In addition, it recently opened two Ethena related vaults (sUSDe and ENA) and generated an additional 37.5M sUSDe and 23.3M ENA.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nMellow is seeking to establish the amphrETH/rstETH/Re7LRT/steakLRT/wstETH on Balancer to develop liquidity for its stETH backed LRTs. This move aims to enhance the trading experience of users, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value for the Mellow community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\n1. Governance: Mellow currently operates with a multi-sig with [publicly](https://research.lido.fi/t/mellow-lido-alliance-proposal/7557/19) verified signers. The protocol is planning to transition to decentralized governance as soon as required research and preparations are made.\n\n2. Oracles: Mellow is working with RedStone to create price feeds for its LRTs.\n\n3. Audits: Mellow collaborates with renowned security experts and audit firms, including Chainsecurity, Statemind, and Spearbit, and we only release code to production after it has passed external audits.\n\n  1. Statemind Report: https://github.com/mellow-finance/mellow-lrt/blob/dev-symbiotic-deploy/audits/202406_Statemind/Mellow%20LRT%20report%20with%20deployment.pdf\n  2. Second audit to be announced\n  3. Community audit https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/423\n\n4. Centralization vectors: Centralization vectors currently are around upgradeability via 24h timelocked proxy multi-sig and front-end hosting.\n\n5. Market History: Mellow has seen significant growth in TVL since launching in mid June with over 41k ETH across its 4 LRTs. Mellow\n\n6. Value: The balancer pool is the first DEX liquidity pool for Mellow LRTs and is aimed at providing liquidity to its growing community. Mellow is committed to support LPs with a 2x points boost.\n\nThe balancer pools are already live and are available on Ethereum:\n\nhttps://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x4216d5900a6109bba48418b5e2ab6cc4e61cf4770000000000000000000006a1\n\nRate provider reviews: https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/93/files Will be updated after merged to repository.\n\n### Technical Specifications:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x03ac2920378A51d6CA78813b1d7578Dab08d3760`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",
