Frax Protocol’s synthetic assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.\n\nOnboarding frxETH is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.\n\nAave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.\n\nSpecification:\n\nWhat is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Frax Protocol to push this proposal. Increasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform. The ACI received support from the Frax Protocol team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer sfrxETH-related questions.\n\nProvide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nFrax Protocol is a decentralized synthetic asset platform that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets. frxETH is a synthetic token that represents exposure to Ethereum Staking. The sfrxETH token can be used to gain exposure to the staking of ETH and its revenue without actually the need to run a validating node. This allows users to access Staking ETH without having to hold a 32 ETH minimum and run a node infrastructure. Adding sfrxETH to the Aave V3 market as a reserve would bring additional diversity and liquidity to the ecosystem.\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nsfrxETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Frax node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, sfrxETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.\nsfrxETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.\nsfrxETH is a good long-term holding collateral, but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.\nsfrxETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.\nsfrxETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase, and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nCore concepts to understand the unified Frax Finance ecosystem include:\n\nFractional – Frax is the first and only stablecoin with parts of its supply backed by collateral and parts of the supply algorithmically stabilized. The stablecoin (FRAX) is named after this hybrid fractional-reserve system.\n\nFraxswap, a native AMM – Fraxswap is the first AMM with time weighted average market maker orders used by the Frax Protocol for rebalancing collateral, mints/redemptions, expanding/contracting FRAX supply, and deploying protocol owned liquidity onchain.\n\nFraxlend, permissionless lending markets – Fraxlend is the lending facility for the FRAX & FPI stablecoins allowing debt origination, customized non-custodial loans, and onboarding collateral assets to the Frax Finance economy.\n\nCrypto Native CPI Stablecoin – Frax’s end vision is to build the most important decentralized stablecoins in the world. The Frax Price Index (FPI) stablecoin is the first stablecoin pegged to a basket of consumer goods creating its own unit of account separate from any nation state denominated money.\n\nFour Tokens – FRAX is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Frax Share (FXS) is the governance token of the entire Frax ecosystem of smart contracts which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value. FPI is the inflation resistant, CPI pegged stablecoin. FPIS is the governance token of the Frax Price Index and splits its value capture with FXS holders.\n\nGauge Rewards System – The community can propose new gauge rewards for strategies that integrate FRAX stablecoins. FXS emissions are fixed, halve each year, and entirely flow to different gauges based on the votes of veFXS stakers.\n\nFrax Ether: it is a liquid ETH staking derivative designed to uniquely leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and smoothen the Ethereum staking process for a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native way to earn interest on ETH.\n\n5. How is the sfrxETH token currently used?\n\nFraxLend is the current primary use case of sfrxETH to be used as collateral, with a liquidity of $13.6M\n\nIt’s likely an Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of sfrxETH holding.\n\nsFrxETH is a yield-bearing Asset\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\nsfrxETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH to convert it to frxETH and then stake into frax protocol to obtain sfrxETH\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nsfrxETH is minted when stakers deposit frxETH into the Frax Protocol deposit pool, and sfrxETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their frxETH.\n\nThe Frax protocol contracts do have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities. This was pointed out in code4Arena audit 1.\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $60 192 819\n24H Volume ~$1.4M (frxETH/ETH on Curve)\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\n\nExchanges:\n\nCurve (the main source of liquidity with frxETH/ETH, sfrxETH can be unstaked for frxETH)\nBalancer\nUniswap V3\nFurther information here: [Fill this]\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 850 members\nTwitter: 64.1k followers\nGithub: 67 followers\nTelegram: 14200 members\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment: 10-06-2022\nNumber of Transactions: 2958 transactions\nNumber of holders for token: 858 holders (liquidity pools are recorded as 1 address)\nTechnical Specifications\nsfrxETH\nsfrxETH is a ERC-4626 vault designed to accrue the staking yield of the Frax ETH validators. At any time, frxETH can be exchanged for sfrxETH by depositing it into the sfrxETH vault, which allows users to earn staking yield on their frxETH. Over time, as validators accrue staking yield, an equivalent amount of frxETH is minted and added to the vault, allowing users to redeem their sfrxETH for a greater amount of frxETH than they deposited. The exhange rate of frxETH per sfrxETH increases over time as staking rewards are added to the vault. By holding sfrxETH you hold a % claim on an increasing amount of the vault’s frxETH, splitting staking rewards up among sfrxETH holders proportional to their share of the total sfrxETH. This is similar to other auto-compounding tokens like Aave’s aUSDC.\n\nSecurity Considerations\nFrax Finance smart contracts have been independently audited by :\n\nCode4Arena\nbug bounty:\n\nThe bounty is simply calculated as the lower value of 10% of the total possible exploit or $10m worth paid in FRAX+FXS (evenly split). https://docs.frax.finance/smart-contracts/miscellaneous 1\n\nRisk parameters\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams Gauntlet (@Pauljlei) & @ChaosLabs, the ACI suggests the following risk parameters to start the conversation. These parameters define a non-borrowable asset with a 67% LTV.\n\nbecause sfrxETH has limited supply and liquidity compared to stETH and rETH,\n\nand because, as of now, minting permissions are not strictly limited, a supply cap is added in this proposal to limit protocol exposure to this asset\n\nadditionally, the current maturity of sfrxETH is not considered fit by the ACI to be a candidate for emode.\n\nThe ACI invites the community to follow the evolution of sfrxETH and consider adjusting mid-term the risk parameters of sfrxETH.\n\nThis will make sfrxETH slightly less attractive than stETH, rETH & cbETH but reflect the difference in liquidity between them.\n\nSymbol: sfrxETH\n\nIsolation Mode: NO\n\nBorrowable: NO\n\nCollateral Enabled: YES\n\nemode: NO\n\nLTV: 67%\n\nLT: 74%\n\nLB: 7.5%\n\nRF: N/A\n\nLPF: 0.10\n\nDebt Ceiling: N/A\n\nSupply Cap: 5k\n\nBorrow Cap: N/A",

Frax Finance has in the past done so in Aave v2 on Ethereum and has already stated on the Aave governance forum an interest in doing so on other deployments once FRAX is added.\n\nThe Frax Finance team could deploy a similar Aave Lending AMOs to Aave v3 after FRAX is listed.This will provide Aave users with access to FRAX and present an alternative to the four USD stable coins on Aave v3.\n\nUsers are able to borrow FRAX and earn yield across DeFi, such as on Curve Finance and Convex Finance.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1.

FRAX is currently the [#7 largest stablecoin by market cap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins) (1B) according to Coingecko. FRAX has also never lost peg a single time in its existence (defined as more than 1 cent price deviation on each side).\n\nFRAX currently has the largest Curve pool on Ethereum mainnet with almost $900M in liquidity and is a Uniswap top 10 token. Additionally, FRAX has already been successfully lent out on Aave v2 on ETH mainnet for many months and is a popular borrowable stable coin with no issues of unpegging or economic problems.\n\nFRAX is also already deployed natively on Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum and Optimism where Aave v3 resides.\n\n# Motivation\n\nFRAX can use its Lending AMO (similar to Maker’s DAI Direct Deposit Module) to mint protocol controlled FRAX to be lent out on Aave Protocol. Frax Finance has in the past done so in Aave v2 via an Aave Lending AMO. \n\nThe Frax Finance team could deploy a similar Aave Lending AMOs to Aave v3 after FRAX is listed.This will provide Aave users with access to FRAX and present an alternative to the three USD stable coins on Aave v3.\n\n\nUsers are able to borrow FRAX and earn yield across DeFi, such as on Curve Finance and Convex Finance.\n\n# Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n*  There is no link between the authors and the core teams of the asset.\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n*  See summary.\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n*  FRAX is a popular stablecoin to borrow, with its Lending AMOs it is able to mint protocol-owned FRAX to ensure low interest rates.\n4. Emission schedule\n*  FRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.\n5. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n*  There is a multisig which can operate certain AMO contracts but cannot in any way change users’ FRAX balances, cannot freeze or pause any user’s funds, and cannot in any way alter the behavior of the protocol or sweep/rug collateral or value. There are no FRAX whitelists/blacklists in any capacity as it is entirely a bearer asset/decentralized exactly like DAI.\n6.

The protocol reduces ETH 2.0 staking capital and hardware requirements to increase Ethereum's decentralisation and security. Rocket Pool lets customers stake trustlessly to a network of node operators to do this.\nThe Ethereum 2.0 base protocol requires 32 ETH, technical competence, and a machine with a CPU processor with four cores and a minimum clock speed of 2.80 gigahertz. Without a way to lessen the costs to admission for ETH holders, these restrictions would endanger decentralisation and network security. Even if consumers could stake, their ETH would be illiquid until a predefined lock-up period, which would degrade the staker experience. Rocket Pool users will be locked up until Ethereum 2.0 phase 2.\n\n#### _Isolation mode_\nAdding support for RPL on Ethereum V3 in isolated mode would allow RPL holders to borrow stablecoins by leveraging their RPL position, boosting the RPL stablecoin utlization rate and attracting new RPL Deposits.\n\n#### _Oracles_\nOngoing integration via Chainlink.\n\n## Specification\n\n#### _What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?_\n\nStableLabs & ACI have no link and are not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal\n\n#### _Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token._\nRocket Pool is Ethereum 2.0 staking.

Even if consumers could stake, their ETH would be iliquid until a predefined lock-up period, which would degrade the staker experience. Rocket Pool users will be locked up until Ethereum 2.0 phase 2.\nRPL Token Ethereum Address: 0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f\n\n#### _Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?_\nRPL is the governance and utility token for RocketPool, as the governance token for a major decentralized liquid staking derivative protocol, RocketPool has solidified itself as a Protocol which is actively contributing to Ethereum’s decentralization by making Operating a Node easy and accessible. By supporting RPL on Aave V3 Ethereum we would create an alternative for RPL holders who wish to earn yield on their asset.\n\n#### _Non-collateral onboarding_\nAdding support for RPL on Ethereum V3 as a non-collateral asset would allow RPL holders to obtain a yield on their RPL holdings. Users will borrow RPL mainly to allow them to deploy mini-pools and start staking.\n\n#### _Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?_\nAs it became evident that Ethereum would switch from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, David Rugendyke established Rocket Pool in 2016. A minimum of 32 ETH, some technical know-how, and a computer with a CPU processor with four cores and a minimum clock speed of 2.80 gigahertz would be needed to validate on the Ethereum 2.0 base protocol. \nThese obstacles would endanger the network's decentralisation and security in the absence of a solution that lowered the admission barriers for ETH holders. Additionally, even if users were able to stake, their ETH would stay non-liquid until a predefined lock-up period had passed, which would worsen the stakers' user experience. Users will be subject to his lock-up period until phase 2 of the rollout of Ethereum 2.0, even on Rocket Pool.\n\n#### _How is RPL currently used?_\nRPL is actively being used to power the RocketPool Protocol, the RPL mechanics are used in multiple key places to drive the protocol forward.\n— rETH value is protected by node operators staking RPL as insurance for a proper service. In the event that node operators perform poorly, the staked RPL is used as insurance.\n— The RocketPool Protocol also has Oracle DAO members who post RPL bonds as an assurance of good behavior.\n—  RPL is also used in RocketPool Protocol DAO Governance.\nRPL is also being used to provide liquidity on Uniswap and Balancer\n\n#### _Emission schedule_\nRPL is distributed as follows 15% for Oracle DAO members who contribute a variety of Oracle data, 70% for node operators who stake RPL as insurance collateral, and another 15% for the Protocol DAO Treasury, which supports decentralized development.\n\n#### _Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?_\nThe RocketPool Protocol is owned and managed by the RocketPool Protocol DAO. The RocketPool DAO runs a Snapshot Subspace where they vote on Governance Proposals. \n\nRPL Contract: [0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f)\n\nThe direction of the RocketPool protocol is shaped by the Rocket Pool Protocol DAO (pDAO), which is managed by RPL governance. A square root modifier transmits pDAO voting power from node operators' effective staked RPL.\nWithin Rocket Pool, Node Operators may submit and vote on new Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals (RPIP). For RPL, the RocketPool DAO controls all admin actions.\n\n#### _Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)_\nMarket capitalisation: $917,000,000\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\nUniswap V3\nETH/RPL (20/80) - 0xe42318eA3b998e8355a3Da364EB9D48eC725Eb45\n\n#### _Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)_\nDiscord: 19,778\nTwitter: 40.6K\nGithub: 115\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of Deployment: September 2017 \nNumber of transactions: 196,206\nNumber of token holders: 8,351\n\n#### _Risk parameters_\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams, we suggest the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\n**Symbol: RPL**\n\nContract Address: [0xD33526068D116cE69F19A9ee46F0bd304F21A51f](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd33526068d116ce69f19a9ee46f0bd304f21a51f)\n\n| Parameter          | Value |\n|--------------------|-------|\n| Isolation Mode     | NO    |\n| Borrowable         | YES   |\n| Collateral Enabled | NO    |\n| LTV                | 0   |\n| LT                 | N/A   |\n| LB                 | N/A   |\n| Debt Ceiling       | N/A   |\n| Reserve Factor     | 20%   |\n| Supply Cap         | 3M    |\n| Borrow Cap         | 2M    |",

USDC lenders receive the corresponding fUSDC, representing their right to reclaim the underlying USDC plus accrued interest, and which can be freely transferred. Positions are collateralized by OUSG, which is invested into Blackrock’s SHV ETF (with a small portion of USD and USDC for liquidity purposes). Read more on OUSG [here](https://ondo.finance/ousg).\n\nfUSDC is a new financial primitive with arguably the **best risk-adjusted yield** available in DeFi.\n\n*Isolated mode*\n\nAdding support for fUSDC on Ethereum V3 in **isolated mode** would allow fUSDC holders to borrow stablecoins on Aave and leverage their fUSDC position, boosting the stablecoin utilization rate on Aave, while attracting new stablecoin deposits thanks to boosted supply rates.\n\nFor example, as the fUSDC yield [oscillates around 4% APR](https://fluxfinance.com/market/usdc), borrowing USDC on Aave should be profitable up to [90% utilization rate](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3).\n\n\n![image|690x307](upload://p0A7wVqcMZT8osi6JwSn3YzsKcr.png)\n\nUSDC IR model on Aave eth V3. A 90% utilization rate would align Aave borrow and Flux supply APR.\n\n**Oracles:** A custom Oracle audited and ready to be deployed leveraging the fUSDC/USDC Flux exchange rate and piggybacks to the USDC chainlink oracle.\n\nfUSDC is not a traded token and therefore does not have or need a chainlink oracle based on trade volumes.\n\n## Specification\n\n#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe ACI is an independent service provider to the Aave DAO, while Ondo finance provided support & Data for the creation of this TEMP check, the ACI is not linked nor paid by Ondo to publish this AIP\n\n#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nFlux Finance is a fork of Compound V2, with minor changes to support permissioned tokens such as Ondo Finance’s Short-Term U.S. Government Bond Fund (OUSG), alongside permissionless tokens, such as USDC. USDC lenders receive the corresponding fUSDC, representing their right to reclaim the underlying USDC plus accrued interest, and which can be freely transferred. Positions are collateralized by OUSG, which is invested into Blackrock’s SHV ETF (with a small portion of USD and USDC for liquidity purposes). Read more on OUSG [here](https://ondo.finance/ousg).\n\nfUSDC is a new financial primitive with arguably the **best risk-adjusted yield** available in DeFi.\n\nfUSDC Token Ethereum Address: `0x465a5a630482f3abD6d3b84B39B29b07214d19e5`\n\n1. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\n*Isolated mode*\n\nAdding support for fUSDC on Ethereum V3 in **isolated mode** would allow fUSDC holders to borrow stablecoins on Aave and leverage their fUSDC position, boosting the stablecoin utilization rate on Aave, while attracting new stablecoin deposits thanks to boosted supply rates.\n\nFor example, as the fUSDC yield [oscillates around 4% APR](https://fluxfinance.com/market/usdc), borrowing USDC on Aave should be  profitable up to [90% utilization rate](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3).\n\n*Avoid using fUSDC as a borrowable asset*\n\nfUSDC can be exposed to price manipulation (up-only via donation). As this can put borrowers under liquidation risk in case of price manipulation, fUSDC should not be added as a borrowable asset.\nThe recent issue with 0vix and vGHST asset is a prime example of this potential vector of risk.\n\n#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFlux is governed by the Ondo DAO, which went live on January 12th 2023. Its first Flux markets got initialized on February 3rd 2023.\n\nFlux offers yield opportunities to stablecoin lenders (USDC, DAI, USDT, FRAX), while allowing OUSG investors to borrow stablecoins against their underlying tokenized US Treasuries.\n\n#### How is fUSDC currently used?\n\nHolding fUSDC allows users to earn a yield on their USDC.\n\nfUSDC can also be used as a RToken collateral, launched by the [Reserve Protocol](https://twitter.com/reserveprotocol)\n[https://twitter.com/FluxDeFi/status/1643350249207889920?s=20](https://twitter.com/FluxDeFi/status/1643350249207889920?s=20)\n\n#### Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule. fUSDC is minted or burned based on deposits or withdrawals of USDC.\n\n#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nThe Flux Lending Market and fUSDC contracts are owned by the Ondo DAO. The Ondo DAO is gated behind a 3 day voting period and 1 day time lock. \n\nSimilar to Compound, Flux has upgradeable comptroller and fToken (cToken) contracts. \n\n- Flux’s Comptroller Contract: `0x95Af143a021DF745bc78e845b54591C53a8B3A51`\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x95Af143a021DF745bc78e845b54591C53a8B3A51](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95Af143a021DF745bc78e845b54591C53a8B3A51)\n- Flux’s fUSDC Contract: `0x465a5a630482f3abD6d3b84B39B29b07214d19e5`\n    \n    [https://etherscan.io/address/0x465a5a630482f3abD6d3b84B39B29b07214d19e5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x465a5a630482f3abD6d3b84B39B29b07214d19e5)\n    \n\nFor the Comptroller, the Ondo DAO controls all admin actions, including initializing markets, setting collateral factors, setting the close factor, setting the price oracle, setting borrow caps, and all pause actions below. A 3/n multisig (`0x118919e891D0205A7492650AD32E727617FA9452`)  controlled by the Flux team acts as the `pauseGuardian`, which can pause transfers, liquidations, mints, and borrows.\n\nFor fUSDC, the Ondo DAO controls all admin actions, including setting the interest rate model, comptroller, reserve factor, and KYC registry. The KYC registry is controlled by the Ondo 3/n team multisig and gates which users can be permissioned security token holders and permissioned borrowers.\n\nCurrently, the InterestRateModel and Oracle contracts are controlled by the Flux team’s 3/n multisig. The Oracle contract allows a 3/n multisig to set the underlying asset’s hardcoded price or Chainlink price feed. The InterestRateModel contract sets the interest rate curve for the markets. Post an upcoming vote (week of April 24, 2023), both of these non-upgradeable contracts will be controlled by the Ondo DAO. \n\n#### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market capitalisation: $7,091,198\n\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\n\nCurve\n\n- [fUSDC/fDAI (50/50) - 0x5105a9E847965421a8C81cA33Ea682948694A6F4](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crypto-237/deposit)\n\n####  Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\n- Discord: 22,304 members\n- Twitter: 3283 followers\n- Github: 4 followers\n\n#### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: [3rd February 2023](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ondo-dao/proposal/3) (after the vote ended)\n- Number of transactions: 802\n- Number of token holders: 400\n\n## Risk Management\n\nfUSDC is collateralized by OUSG, which is invested into Blackrock’s SHV ETF (with a small portion of USD and USDC for liquidity purposes). The underlying assets in the SHV ETF have a very low risk profile, and the ETF itself is highly liquid.\n\nTo mitigate risk, we suggest implementing the following risk parameters for fUSDC:\n\n- Loan to Value (LTV): 75%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 80%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 5%\n- Reserve Factor: 10%\n- Interest Rate Strategy: Similar to USDC\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdding support for fUSDC on Ethereum v3 in isolated mode has the potential to attract new stablecoin deposits, increase stablecoin utilization rates on Aave, and provide additional opportunities for users to leverage their fUSDC positions.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback: Engage with the Aave community to collect feedback and address any concerns or suggestions.\n2. Publish a temperature check snapshot vote: Conduct a preliminary snapshot vote to gauge community sentiment on the proposal.\n3. Escalate to ARFC stage: If the temperature check is favorable, move the proposal to the Aave Request for Comments (ARFC) stage for further discussion and refinement.\n4. Gather feedback from risk service providers: Consult with risk assessment teams like Gauntlet and Chaos Labs to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of adding fUSDC as collateral.\n5. Escalate to ARFC snapshot vote: If the risk assessment is positive and community feedback is supportive, proceed to an official ARFC snapshot vote.\n6. Escalate to AIP stage: If the ARFC snapshot vote passes, move the proposal to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval and implementation.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK is released under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication.
