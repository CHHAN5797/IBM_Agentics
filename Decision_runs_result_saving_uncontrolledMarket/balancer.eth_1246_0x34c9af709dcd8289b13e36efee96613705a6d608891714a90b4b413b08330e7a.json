We welcome anyone who is willing to take the time to verify the content and encourage community members to share their feedback with us.*\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nPer [BIP-103](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xddc174b931a0d2e5e32276a3d0d7110367797dd24248f078d0f7876d0987c92f), karpatkey has been tasked with deploying yield-generating strategies using a portion of the existing funds in the treasury in a risk-adjusted, trust-minimised, and non-custodial manner.\n\nA new SAFE owned by the BalancerDAO was created, a Manager preset was applied to allow a specific subset of transactions and the in-scope funds were transferred. More details can be found in [this post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-162-karpatkey-investment-strategy/4220/11?u=santinomics). Since February, karpatkey has been managing the treasury portfolio, and [weekly reports](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386) are published on the forum. \n\nAs we anticipated, the permissions preset is an evolving configuration that needs to be adjusted regularly. In this first update request, we are looking to fulfill the following objectives:\n\n* To further improve the efficiency of the swaps, we request the BalancerDAO to introduce new permissions to the preset allowing swapping on Uniswap v3 using the ```exactInputSingle``` function, which is expected to provide alternative swapping routes that will yield better results.\n\n* Additionally, a new permission to increase liquidity on the existing WBTC-WETH pool on Uniswap v3 with [NFT ID 430246](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool/430246) is necessary. This is because, when configuring the permissions for the first time, a different position on the pool was created ([NFT ID 418522](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pools/418522)). However, at the time of deploying the funds into the pool, the position was out of range. Therefore, a new position was created but the ```increaseLiquidity``` function has never been whitelisted until now.\n\n* Lastly, we request adjustments to the swap function on the Balancer Vault contract to implement a more detailed scoping of swaps, which will allow for a more robust and secure swapping process.\n\nA new version of the [_“Preset permissions - Balancer”_ document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XKHGuPr6omIA1e10jfZg0IMYtNu0mfnHtbInPBMEsYY/edit?usp=sharing) that lists all the permissions applied to the Manager preset (including the ones being requested now) has been created. In this v2, the requested permissions are clearly highlighted as updates.\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal is expected to be voted on Snapshot, and upon successful passing, the Safe multisig holding the in-scope assets will execute the following payload. Please note that the payload only contains the changes between the deployed version and the new one. The BalancerDAO multisig owners will receive a .json file with the payload, which can be executed through the Transaction Builder app on the SAFE environment.

        "body": "In order to initiate operations as per [BIP-103](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-103-karpatkey-balancer-treasury-cu-proposal-update/3895), Karpatkey respectfully requests the Balancer DAO to take the following actions:\n\n1. Dismantle specific positions on the current multisigs on Mainnet, Polygon, and Arbitrum (as outlined in the Execution Details section);\n2. Bridge specific in-scope assets from Polygon and Arbitrum back to Mainnet (as outlined in the Execution Details section);\n3. Transfer all in-scope assets (totaling approximately $5,900,000 as of the day of this writing) to a new SAFE provided by Karpatkey and owned by the Balancer DAO (as outlined in the Next Steps and Execution Details sections).\n\n## Motivation\n\nAfter internal discussion, the Karpatkey team has determined that the Balancer DAO would be best served by a simpler and more direct approach. Since Karpatkey has already been voted in as the treasury manager, there is no longer a need for further discussion or a new vote on the specific allocation of funds, despite having recently proposed the \"Base vs Expanded allocation\" approach.\n\nTo streamline deployment, Karpatkey proposes beginning with the base allocation and then expanding as needed. This approach takes advantage of the Zodiac Roles Modifier permissions preset that has already been created and tested for allowlisting specific functions and protocols related to the base allocation. Karpatkey intends to move forward with this approach and will propose future adjustments in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the original proposal. However, any future adjustments to the strategy, and thus the preset, will ultimately require the approval of the Balancer DAO through the execution of a batch of transactions to apply the adjusted preset.\n\n### Zodiac Roles Modifier preset to be applied\n\nThe original post proposed the following:\n\n[quote=\"karpatkey, post:1, topic:4220\"]\n## Base allocation\n\nIf this proposal was selected, specific functions within the protocols below would be whitelisted. More technical details regarding the whitelisting process will be provided shortly.\n\n* Staking:\n  * Lido\n  * Stakewise\n* Lending:\n  * Compound v2\n  * Aave v2\n* AMM:\n  * Uniswap v3\n[/quote]\n\nTo increase flexibility and adapt to changing market conditions, Karpatkey suggests expanding protocols and functions to include ETH wrappers and unwrappers, swaps on Balancer and Uniswap v3. These swaps, except for regularly swapped reward tokens, are intended to provide Karpatkey with the ability to take immediate action in specific market conditions, such as a stablecoin losing its peg. The pools were chosen based on liquidity to maximize results for the Balancer DAO, but new permissions may be necessary as market conditions change.\n\nThe Manager preset consists of the complete list of permissions that Karpatkey asks the Balancer DAO to grant. This list can be found in this [Annex Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gtLsmCexiY0XWFwWdgpEaq2wgNDW7Z0ZvsX7p5-C2E/edit?usp=sharing). Through the Zodiac Role Modifier, the Manager preset will be applied to the Manager Role, which in turn will be assigned to Karpatkey’s Manager SAFE.\n\n### Future permissions and roles\n\nOnce the initial strategy is deployed, there will be a periodic need to adapt the portfolio to changing market conditions. If a particular strategy no longer provides sufficient yield, or if a particular pool in which the Balancer DAO has a position becomes deprecated and needs to be migrated, new permissions will be required.\n\nIn addition, creating new roles to improve or expand operations will also be necessary. Two new roles are planned for the near future: the *Harvester Role* and the *Swapper Role*. Both roles will be granted specific subsets of the Manager preset permissions and will be assigned to EOAs to automate certain tasks. The Harvester Role will be allowed to claim rewards, while the Swapper Role will be allowed to swap these rewards for ETH or stablecoins.\n\nWhen deemed appropriate, Karpatkey will create a new forum post requesting the Balancer DAO to update the preset or deploy new roles. The post will include an explanation of why the permissions and/or roles are needed and the executable payload. The proposal will need to be passed by the community and, once approved, it will be executed by the multisig according to the DAO standard operating practices. It is important that this process is as simple and straightforward as possible, since every day of waiting may represent an opportunity cost to the DAO's treasury. A summary of the new permissions and/or roles will be included as a separate section in every corresponding weekly report.\n\n### Next steps\n\nThe next steps for implementing this proposal are as follows:\n\n1. Karpatkey will create a new SAFE, deploy the Roles Modifier contract, and apply the Manager Role preset (as outlined in the Annex Document) to simplify the process for the Balancer DAO.\n2. Karpatkey will conduct a small-scale replication of the strategy for a second round of testing.\n3. Once the SAFE is created, tested, and permissions are applied, Karpatkey will transfer ownership of it to the Balancer DAO and remove themselves as owner.\n4. This proposal will be submitted to Snapshot for approval.\n5. If the proposal is approved, the Balancer DAO will execute the steps described in the Execution Details section.\n\n### Execution details\n\nThe following list is intended to serve as a clear execution roadmap for the Balancer DAO once (if) this proposal is approved:\n\n1. Dismantle the Balancer Boosted AAVE USD position on Mainnet and withdraw 100% of the funds in DAI.\n2. Dismantle WBTC + ETH position on Mainnet and withdraw the two assets in equal proportion.\n3. Dismantle ETH + GTC position on Mainnet and withdraw the two assets in equal proportion.\n4. Dismantle MATIC + USDC + WETH + BAL position on Polygon and withdraw the four assets in equal proportion.\n5. Bridge USDC and WETH from Polygon back to Mainnet.\n6. Dismantle WBTC + WETH + USDC position on Arbitrum and withdraw the three assets in equal proportion.\n7. Bridge WBTC, WETH + USDC from Arbitrum back to Mainnet.\n8. Transfer in-scope assets to the new SAFE. The approximate balances (as of the day of this writing) of in-scope assets that will be transferred are:\n\n|Token|Price|Approx Balance|Total Value|Share %|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|USDC|$1.00|2,514,827|$2,514,827|42.61%|\n|AAVE|$79.50|16,907|$1,344,129|22.77%|\n|stETH|$1,542.51|312.86|$482,590|8.18%|\n|WETH|$1,552.80|266.81|$414,301|7.02%|\n|wstETH|$1,707.08|155.02|$264,632|4.48%|\n|DAI|$1.00|239,996|$239,996|4.07%|\n|WBTC|$21,007.20|11.06|$232,289|3.94%|\n|USDT|$1.00|218,949|$218,949|3.71%|\n|ETH|$1,553.00|122.82|$190,733|3.23%|\n|Grand Total|||$5,902,446|100.00%|\n\n### Specification\n\nKarpatkey has prepared the Gnosis safe on Ethereum at `0x0EFcCBb9E2C09Ea29551879bd9Da32362b32fc89`.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/528\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces additional actions and strategies to the portion of the treasury managed by karpatkey (as per [BIP-103](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-103-karpatkey-balancer-treasury-cu-proposal-update/3895)), aiming to enhance the treasury’s performance, adaptability, and diversification.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nPermissions granted to karpatkey to manage the BalancerDAO treasury are not static, and require regular updates to effectively respond to evolving market conditions and to capitalise on emerging opportunities.\n\nAs it’s customary, any changes to the preset permissions must be executed by the DAO.\n\n\n# Specification\n\nPermissions that will be added in this proposal are:\n\n\n\n1. Deposit USDC on Compound v3;\n2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3;\n3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3;\n4. Deposit DAI on MakerDAO’s Dai Savings Rate (DSR) module;\n5. Unstake stETH on Lido;\n6. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Rocket Pool (rETH);\n7. Swap on Cow Swap\n\n\n### Audit considerations\n\nWe propose an updated version of the [Preset permissions - Balancer Treasury](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQjkn6DAqXhdqYag0KSIfqJvdkLilOb6dM4KqaiybXc/edit) document that shows all the permissions granted to karpatkey, including the ones that are being requested now, highlighted in green.\n\nReviewing and providing feedback on the preset update [payload](https://gist.github.com/santinomics/1f0d96856166d673551e2f316bace89d) would be a great service to the Balancer community. We welcome anyone who is willing to take the time to verify the content and encourage community members to share their feedback with us.\n\nkarpatkey's tech team is diligently working on enhancing the auditing process. Our primary goal is to provide a clearer visual representation of potential Zodiac preset modifications before implementing any proposed payload. We are committed to keeping the community informed about our progress and developments.\n\n# Proposed Actions Overview\n\n\n\n### 1. Deposit USDC on Compound v3\n\n[Compound v3](https://docs.compound.finance/) is a streamlined protocol version emphasising security, capital efficiency, and user experience. Following a [proposal](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/180) executed on September 18th, v2 is being phased out, with measures in place to transition users to v3. [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-iii-audit/) and [ChainSecurity](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/compound-iii/) have audited v3. As of the day of this writing, $319M USDC is deposited in v3, offering an APR of 4.3%, inclusive of COMP token rewards.\n\n\n\n### 2. Deposit DAI on AAVE v3\n\nThis strategy aims to diversify stablecoin holdings via AAVE v3, a leading decentralised money market with a strong link to the Balancer DAO. [AAVE v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-aave-v3/6035) was officially [deployed on mainnet](https://aave.mirror.xyz/K9gQPsv-hAH-gO4oH2i0Oen8uQEHYL5q8x9xjN9XnmA) in January 2023 after being live across six networks [since March 2022](https://aave.mirror.xyz/2TnHYHQRnNhSG56Y4CcssulFArSVqrFbmAdYfU7Kxp0). This version introduces features for enhanced capital efficiency and decentralisation, coupled with new risk management tools. Comprehensive audits by firms like [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf), [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf), [Peckshield](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf), OpenZeppelin, SigmaPrime, and formal verification by [Certora](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/Certora/certora/Verification_Report.pdf). Currently, [AAVE v3](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) holds $51.6M DAI with an expected APY of 3.82%.\n\n\n\n### 3. Deposit USDC on AAVE v3\n\nSame logic as above but for USDC. As of the day of this writing, the total USDC supplied on [AAVE v3](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) is $299M, and the expected APY is 2.86%.\n\n\n\n### 4. Deposit DAI on MakerDAO’s DAI Savings Rate (DSR) module\n\nMakerDAO, renowned for creating DAI, is a leading DAO in the DeFi sector. A recent [DSR rate hike](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-2-non-scope-defined-parameter-changes-may-2023/20981) in May and the [introduction of eDSR](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-enhanced-dai-savings-rate-activation-spark-protocol-debt-ceiling-increase-rwa-vault-updates-avc-member-compensation-for-q2-2023-dao-resolution-for-monetalis-clydesdale-launch-project-funding-spark-proxy-spell-execution-august-2-2023) (enhanced DSR) in August make it an attractive strategy from a risk/reward perspective. Currently, eDSR offers an APR of 5%. By diversifying the Balancer treasury’s stablecoin allocation and capitalising on the higher yield offered by one of the most battle-tested protocols, the investment approach can be optimised.\n\n\n\n### 5. Unstake stETH on Lido\n\nPost the Shapella fork in April, users can now unstake or withdraw staked ETH from the different LST providers. This action was not part of the previous preset update request to the Balancer DAO due to its timing.\n\n\n\n### 6. Stake (and unstake) ETH on Rocket Pool (rETH)\n\nTo diversify LST holdings, we suggest adding [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/) to the whitelist for ETH staking and unstaking. RocketPool ranks [third](https://dune.com/queries/2433350/3997605) in the liquid staking market, holding about 691,000 ETH, or 6% of the total market. In market share, Rocket Pool's rETH trails Lido's stETH (76%) and Coinbase's cbETH (11%). Despite slightly lower liquidity for rETH to ETH swaps on major DEXes, Balancer DAO treasury's allocated amount should face minimal slippage. For example, [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/liquidity) indicates a swap of ~5,700 rETH for ETH would have under 0.1% slippage. Currently, rETH offers an APR of 3.26%.\n\n\n\n### 7. Swap on Cow Swap\n\nThanks to the efforts of the Gnosis Builders and the karpatkey tech team, Cow Swap can now be seamlessly integrated with the Zodiac Roles Modifier. This enhancement allows for the exclusive swapping of only those tokens that are included in the whitelisted strategies.",

There is more than USD 4 mil ETH staked at the time of writing.\n\n#### Protocol Description\n\nBedrock's native tokenized version of staked Ether is known as uniETH.\n\nuniETH represents the staked ETH in Bedrock plus all future staking rewards. uniETH is non-rebasing, i.e. does not grow in quantity over time but grows in value instead. In other words, 1 uniETH will be worth more than 1 ETH as time goes on, and its value will continue to increase as more time passes. uniETH’s non-rebasing model allows users to hold uniETH on centralized exchanges and use it in decentralized financial applications seamlessly.\n\nLaunched by RockX, Bedrock is a non-custodial solution that satisfies the requirements of institutions seeking a basis for large-scale liquid staking. By bringing new levels of transparency and security to liquid staking, Bedrock allows institutions to unlock liquidity safely by adhering to regulations while leveraging a true crypto-native solution.\n\nReferences/Useful links\n\n[uniETH DApp](https://bedrock.rockx.com/unieth/stake)\n\n[Learn more about uniETH\n](https://bedrock.rockx.com/unieth)[uniETH audit report\n](https://github.com/RockX-SG/stake/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-RockXStaking-v1.0.pdf)[Learn more about Bedrock](https://www.rockx.com/liquid-staking)\n\n[Bedrock DAO Twitter](https://twitter.com/bedrock_dao)\n\n[RockX Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/rockx_official)[Discord]()\n\n### Motivation\n\nBalancer’s ability to increase capital efficiency using composable pools is taking shape across the industry. The uniETH-wstETH-rETH pool fits Balancer’s initiative to be a protocol where Liquidity Pools can safely tap into external yield sources while maintaining effective liquidity for swapping:\n\n* uniETH-wstETH-rETH pool will earn yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer\n* uniETH-wstETH-rETH pool also provides Bedrock with a place for its tokens to be swapped and deposited easily as the pool increases in TVL\n* uniETH-wstETH-rETH will attract more liquid staking tokens to be housed on Balancer, thereby increasing liquidity and transactions on Balancer\n\n#### Specifications\n\nGovernance: The BedrockDAO is slated to launch in the coming months with a DAO token that utilizes the vote escrow model for its token holders to participate in protocol governance and more. An update regarding the DAO token can be found here (https://medium.com/@bedrock_defi/bedrock-1-month-update-whats-next-spoiler-airdrop-e8872425d23d)\n\nOracles: This pool relies on on-chain data calculations, and not on rate providers, to determine uniETH’s balance and estimated rewards.\n\nAudits: See uniETH’s smart contract audit by Peckshield [here](https://github.com/RockX-SG/stake/blob/main/PeckShield-Audit-Report-RockXStaking-v1.0.pdf).\n\nCentralization Vectors: See the architecture of uniETH [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RockX-SG/stake/main/doc/uniETH_ETH2_0_Liquid_Staking_Explained.pdf). All treasury contracts and protocol upgrades have multi-signature wallets in place.\n\nThe multisignature account is the owner of the following contracts\n\nUNIVERSAL_ETH_ADDRESS: '0xF1376bceF0f78459C0Ed0ba5ddce976F1ddF51F4'\n\nSTAKING_ADDRESS: '0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d'\n\nREDEEM_ADDRESS: '0x98169228cB99Ed26c1043eD8Ca53A5Cb371D3B8D'\n\nPROXY_ADMIN: '0xa5F2B6AB5B38b88Ba221741b3A189999b4c889C6'\n\nThe manager role to withdraw manager’s rewards: ‘0x4beFa2aA9c305238AA3E0b5D17eB20C045269E9d’\n\nMarket History: The uniETH token and Bedrock product only went live after our team was able to rigorously test the functionality of staking and unstaking ETH on-chain after the Shapella upgrade. Since its launch, uniETH has been one of the fastest growing liquid staking tokens with more than 2464 ETH (> USD 4 mil) staked on Bedrock.\n\nValue: uniETH is poised to drive great value to the Balancer ecosystem because Balancer will serve as the main liquidity provider for the uniETH-wstETH-rETH 3 token pool, along with the existing uniETH-wETH swap pair. Balancer provides existing Liquid Staking token holders the option to swap across different tokens immediately and in amounts of less than 32 ETH, as opposed to observing a 2-10 day unstaking period if executed through the Bedrock product. This will give liquid staking token holders added utility for their tokens by bringing them onto and transating on Balancer.\n\nBedrock’s uniETH follows AML protocols with KYC/KYB checks required for users who intend to mint more than 32 ETH equivalent of uniETH.\n\n* With this built-in AML capability, uniETH expects to see an influx of institutional funds\n* This will increase the demand for immediate uniETH liquidity on Balancer.\n\nAs a result, liquidity providers will earn the protocol fee on underlying uniETH as well as swap fees.\n\nIn addition, liquidity providers may be entitled to the upcoming Bedrock points campaigns and have access to all its corresponding utilities.\n\nPool Address: [0x70d5E3234F6329c1D5a26796dcf4e109d69A3488](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x70d5e3234f6329c1d5a26796dcf4e109d69a34880000000000000000000005e7)\nGauge Address (2% Cap): [0xe6281Fc01607366794597d7fA6b32931fF986969](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe6281Fc01607366794597d7fA6b32931fF986969#readContract)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xe6281Fc01607366794597d7fA6b32931fF986969`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1154\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to roll out an updated version of the Zodiac Roles Modifier module. The new version improves usability and transparency of treasury management operations. Upon approval, the Roles Modifier v2 module will be activated.\n\nFurthermore, this proposal requests authorization from the DAO to revise the permissions policy. A notable change includes enabling swapping actions on CoW Swap while the other permissions primarily focus on eliminating obsolete actions and protocols, and refining parameters within the existing permissions.\n\n\n# Roles v2 Migration\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Zodiac Roles Modifier facilitates karpatkey’s proxy management of the treasury by ensuring that only pre-approved transactions, defined by the permissions policy voted on by the DAO, can be executed. In collaboration with karpatkey, the Gnosis Guild team has significantly upgraded the Zodiac Roles Modifier module and the Zodiac Roles app. These enhancements have resulted in a more powerful and robust on-chain permissions infrastructure with the following improvements:\n\n\n\n* **Introduction of Allowances**: Implementation of spending limits within permissions.\n* **Enhanced Call Data Scoping Toolset**: This toolset considerably broadens the range of functions that can have permissions set, increasing flexibility.\n* **Advanced Logical Conditions**: Allows for the creation of complex permissions structures to accommodate sophisticated operational needs.\n* **Compatibility with [DeFi Kit](https://kit.karpatkey.com/)**: This feature integrates with karpatkey’s permissions policy building module, facilitating the straightforward crafting of protocol actions.\n* **Improved Visualisation and User Interface**: the new [Zodiac Roles app UI](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/) not only displays permissions clearly but also provides a user-friendly interface to compare changes in each policy update, enhancing transparency and simplifying audits.\n\nFor more detailed information, please refer to the following resources:\n\n\n\n* **Documentation**: [The Zodiac Roles Modifier](https://docs.roles.gnosisguild.org/)\n* **Articles**: [Evolving Smart Accounts with Onchain Permissions](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/oQcy_c62huwNkFS0cMIxXwQzrfG0ESQax8EBc_tWwwk), [Permissions as code](https://engineering.gnosisguild.org/posts/permissions-as-code)\n\n\n## Contract Audits\n\nThe Zodiac Roles Modifier v2 contract has been rigorously audited by G0 Group, the internal auditing team of Gnosis DAO, and by [Omniscia](https://omniscia.io/). The detailed audit reports are available for review [here](https://github.com/gnosisguild/zodiac-modifier-roles/tree/main/packages/evm/docs).\n\n\n# Changes to the Permissions Policy\n\nThis proposal outlines the following modifications to the permissions policy:\n\n\n\n* **Token Arrays for Swapping**:\n    * Considering the tokens involved in the existing permissions, we have updated the token arrays to ensure they can be seamlessly swapped across the various whitelisted protocols and aggregators.\n    * **Token IN Allowlist**: [WBTC, DAI, USDT, stkAAVE, AAVE, COMP,  rETH, SWISE, wstETH, WETH, USDC, stETH].\n    * **Token OUT Allowlist**: [WBTC, DAI, USDT, rETH, wstETH, WETH, USDC, stETH].\n    * The above arrays are to be utilized for swapping on CoW Swap, with equivalent lists replicated for Uniswap v3 and Balancer.\n* **Introduction of CoW Swap**([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x23da9ade38e4477b23770ded512fd37b12381fab)):\n    * Addition of a **CoW Swap Order signer** to enable gas-minimized and MEV-protected swaps. This includes an extensive set of aggregated exchange routes, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of required swaps.\n    * Tokens will be swapped on CoW Swap according to the token IN/OUT allowlists mentioned above.\n* **Deprecations and Removals**:\n    * **Uniswap v2**([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0x68b3465833fb72a70ecdf485e0e4c7bd8665fc45-0x472b43f3)): Removed due to insufficient liquidity in v2 pools.\n    * **Sushiswap**([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0x5550d13389bb70f45fcef58f19f6b6e87f6e747d)): Removed due to insufficient liquidity in Sushiswap pools.\n    * **Stakewise v2**: Deprecated functions related to deposit ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0xc874b064f465bdd6411d45734b56fac750cda29a)) and claim ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0xa3f21010e8b9a3930996c8849df38f9ca3647c20)) functions in light of the recent launch of Stakewise v3.\n    * **Compound v2** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b-0x1c3db2e0)): Discontinued all actions targeting v2 contracts and v2 cTokens (cUSDC, cDAI and cAAVE) due to the ongoing transition of the protocol to its v3.\n    * **Revocation of Existing/Obsolete Allowances:** All existing and outdated allowances previously set by the treasury are revoked (set to zero). The ability to call the corresponding approve functions is included in the newly proposed policy. Accordingly, the payload contains a bundle of transactions to revoke these allowances.\n* **Updates**:\n    * **AAVE Delegation:** Delegation function update for AAVE ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9-0xdc937e1c)) and stkAAVE ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x4da27a545c0c5b758a6ba100e3a049001de870f5-0xdc937e1c)) tokens. Very similar to the delegate function, with the added option of delegation type.\n    * **Uniswap v3** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x68b3465833fb72a70ecdf485e0e4c7bd8665fc45-0x04e45aaf)) **and Balancer** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8)): Adjusted to allow the mentioned token IN/OUT allowlists.\n    * **Lido Withdrawals** ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#right-0x889edc2edab5f40e902b864ad4d7ade8e412f9b1)): Enhanced to include new withdrawal methods using permits for both wstETH and stETH; methods include \"requestWithdrawalsWstETHWithPermit\" and \"requestWithdrawalsWithPermit\".\n    * **Uniswap v3 WBTC / ETH LP (NFT Id 430246)** actions updated ([diff](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false#left-0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88)):\n        * Increase Liquidity\n        * Refund ETH when Increasing Liquidity.\n\n\n# Audit Considerations \n\nWe highly value the community’s involvement in reviewing and providing feedback on this proposal. We encourage members with the necessary technical expertise to examine the content carefully (including this [payload](https://gist.github.com/JeronimoHoulin/848a514985f0f3a1003b4ecfe403cffa)) and share their insights with us.\n\nFor effective testing of the permissions policy configuration, we have utilized a [Testing Avatar Safe](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xC01318baB7ee1f5ba734172bF7718b5DC6Ec90E1). This safe mirrors the current state of the [permissions policy v3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQjkn6DAqXhdqYag0KSIfqJvdkLilOb6dM4KqaiybXc/) granted by the DAO treasury (or Avatar SAFE) to the Manager SAFE operated by karpatkey. The enhancements in the Zodiac Roles app interface now allow for a clear visualization of all existing permissions, accessible [here](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xbd1099dfd3c11b65fb4bb19a350da2f5b61efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1).\n\nThe updated interface also simplifies the process of identifying [changes](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false) by displaying the current permissions policy on the left side and the newly proposed policy on the right side. To further aid in the adoption and understanding of these tools for audit purposes, we have detailed the proposed changes in [version 4 documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEeXMJXsz48MKxiST1rmAHT7Pwr0H1fhnoPBo4y24A4/), following our standard Policy Update Request (PUR) format.\n\n\n# Additional considerations\n\n\n## Roles Modifier v1 and Enabling of v2\n\nThe existing Roles Modifier v1 module will remain active to ensure a smooth transition and prevent any unexpected disruptions in operational execution. Ownership of the deployed [Roles Modifier v2 module](https://etherscan.io/address/0x13c61a25DB73e7a94a244bD2205aDba8b4a60F4a), equipped with the new proposed permissions policy, has been [transferred ](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xfca048b5f788c502c8e1aba7a386d4a228622abd582b77497ec6d71d4a549891)to the treasury’s Avatar Safe. The payload will only activate this module, marking the first phase of the migration process. A subsequent policy update proposal will seek to disable the v1 module.\n\n\n## Policy Visualization in Terms of DeFi Kit Actions\n\nThe “show annotations” button, located at the top-right [here](https://roles.gnosisguild.org/eth:0xBd1099dFD3c11b65FB4BB19A350da2f5B61Efb0d/roles/BALANCER-MANAGER-V1/diff/iTJ1ur6sArvnFgJ87Auppx8FrtbLMt68HnRmpVc?annotations=false), provides a visualization of the proposed permissions policy expressed through the DeFi Kit Protocol Actions. This feature offers a more abstract and simplified description of the policy, enhancing understanding and accessibility.",
