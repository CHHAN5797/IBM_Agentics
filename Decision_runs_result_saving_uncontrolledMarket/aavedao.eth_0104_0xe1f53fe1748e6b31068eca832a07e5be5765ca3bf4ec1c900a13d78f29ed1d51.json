        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to:\n\n(1) Reduce the Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV) for sixteen (16) frozen collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n(2) Increase Reserve Factors for all collateral assets on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to reducing the potential risks associated with V2 markets and promoting migration to V3, we suggest a phased wind-down of the **frozen** V2 markets. The following proposal is part of a series of proposals to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets.\n\nThe previous iteration of proposals:\n\n- [[ARFC] Chaos Labs Risk Parameter Updates - Aave V2 Ethereum - 2023.6.23](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-aave-v2-ethereum-2023-6-23/13789)\n- [[ARFC] Chaos Labs - Incremental Reserve Factor Updates - Aave V2 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766)\n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction.\n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) - This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations.\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% and the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n• “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 35% | 1,580 | 5 |\n| BAT | 52% | 38% | 750 | 3 |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 250 | 3 |\n| DPI | 42% | 22% | 80 | 2 |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 500 | 4 |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 1,500 | 4 |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 1,160 | 3 |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 2,440 | 10 |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 56 | 1 |\n| UNI | 77% | 57% | 500 | 9 |\n| SNX | 59% | 39% | 650 | 10 |\n| MKR | 64% | 44% | 140 | 5 |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 45 | 2 |\n\n• “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 45% | 1,120 | 3 |\n| BAT | 52% | 42% | 80 | 2 |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 250 | 3 |\n| DPI | 42% | 32% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 500 | 4 |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 1,500 | 4 |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 1,160 | 3 |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 2,440 | 10 |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 56 | 1 |\n| UNI | 77% | 67% | 290 | 6 |\n| SNX | 59% | 49% | 85 | 3 |\n| MKR | 64% | 54% | 16 | 2 |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 45 | 2 |\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Aggressive | $10,100 | 58 |\n| Moderate | $8,580 | 43 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### LTV Decrease\n\nFor assets where the LTV is not 0, we recommend maintaining the same buffer as the current configuration.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nIn line with our [V2 to V3 migration plan](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-ethereum-v2-to-v3-migration/12636), we propose another iteration of RF increases on Aave V2 Ethereum. By progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on V2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to V3. In this proposal, we suggest an increase of  5% for all V2 collateral assets.\n\n## Specification\n\nFrozen Assets:\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV* | Current RF | Rec RF |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 55% | 35% / 45% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| BAT | 52% | 38% / 42% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| CVX | 40% | 34% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| DPI | 42% | 22% / 32% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| ENJ | 60% | 54% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| MANA | 62% | 54% | 0 | 0 | 45% | 50% |\n| REN | 40% | 32% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| xSUSHI | 60% | 53% | 0 | 0 | 45% | 50% |\n| YFI | 55% | 52% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| ZRX | 45% | 39% | 0 | 0 | 30% | 35% |\n| LINK | 83% | 78% | 70% | 65% | 25% | 30% |\n| 1INCH | 50% | 40% | 40% | 30% | 25% | 30% |\n| UNI | 77% | 57% / 67% | 65% | 45% / 55% | 25% | 30% |\n| SNX | 59% | 39% / 49% | 46% | 26% / 36% | 40% | 45% |\n| MKR | 64% | 44% / 55% | 59% | 39% / 49% | 25% | 30% |\n| ENS | 57% | 50% | 47% | 40% | 25% | 30% |\n- Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options.\n\nUnfrozen Assets\n\n| Asset | Current RF | Recommended RF |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| DAI | 15% | No Change - will be addressed in a separate proposal  |\n| FRAX | 25% | 30% |\n| GUSD | 15% | 20% |\n| LUSD | 15% | 20% |\n| sUSD | 25% | 30% |\n| TUSD | 25% | 30% |\n| USDC | 15% | 20% |\n| USDP | 15% | 20% |\n| USDT | 15% | 20% |\n| CRV | 25% | 30% |\n| WBTC | 25% | 30% |\n| ETH | 20% | 25% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

This change will effectively remove any yield for depositors of these assets, thereby discouraging their supply.\n\n### Increase Borrow Rates:\n\nTo encourage the repayment of borrowed assets, we propose raising the borrow rates across V2 frozen assets. This will be achieved by creating a constant borrow rate up to the currently set UOptomal configuration. Accordingly, we put forward the following options for the community to choose from:\n\n**Moderate (Chaos Recommendation):**\n\n1. Set Base Rate at 20%\n2. Set Slope1 at 0%\n3. Set Slope2 at 300%\n\n**Aggressive:**\n\n1. Set Base Rate at 40%\n2. Set Slope1 at 0%\n3. Set Slope2 at 300%\n\nAfter these changes are put into effect, we'll evaluate their influence on loan repayments and, if necessary, offer additional recommendations. Future updates could involve further hikes in borrow rates and adjustments to the UOptimal points.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur RF | Rec RF | Cur Base | Rec Base | Cur Slope1 | Rec Slope1 | Cur Slope2 | Rec Slope2 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1INCH | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| BAL | 35% | 99.90% | 5% | 20% / 40% | 27% | 0% | 150% | 300% |\n| BAT | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| CRV | 30% | 99.90% | 3% | 20% / 40% | 17% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| CVX | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| DPI | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| ENJ | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| ENS | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| MANA | 50% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| MKR | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| REN | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| SNX | 45% | 99.90% | 3% | 20% / 40% | 15% | 0% | 100% | 300% |\n| UNI | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| xSUSHI | 50% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| YFI | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| ZRX | 35% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| KNCL | 30% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 8% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| UST | 20% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 7% | 0% | 300% | 300% |\n| AMPL | 10% | 99.90% | 1% | 20% / 40% | 3% | 0% | 750% | 300% |\n| RAI | 20% | 99.90% | 0% | 20% / 40% | 4% | 0% | 75% | 300% |\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1.

        "body": "## Overview\n\nThis proposal continues on the proposed steps from [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719) by recommending the removal of sUSD as collateral on Aave V3’s Optimism. Additionally, we recommend reducing the LT and LTV of the Stablecoin E-Mode on Optimism, which sUSD is part of, and setting sUSD LTV to 0.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis recommendation follows the recent proposal to reduce the supply and borrow cap of sUSD to 10m and 1, respectively; that recommendation follows a period of reduced sUSD DEX liquidity, which dropped to a buy-side low of $2M before recovering after the introduction of token incentives.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151805.225.png](ipfs://bafkreihgsfq3rklem3uewkfzhpofau2fc7mkp742shace72sae7aay3d7i)\nDuring this period, shorting activity on sUSD was observed between January 9th and January 15th. Following the implementation of token incentives on January 16th, as detailed in [this announcement](https://x.com/synthetix_io/status/1878944713446924552), these short positions were closed, and new borrowing demand primarily came from users farming the newly introduced incentives.\n\nBelow, we present a table of the current sUSD borrows on Aave and the associated strategy exposure. The distribution of such strategies seems to be quite dispersed, with the recent incentive structure leading to demand to create perpetual positions on Synthetix coupled with liquidity pool growth rather than short positions.\n\n| User | Action | Size | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0xD8b88C185e06eBF8C58B7dc8b7AFf18304CdD888 | Short | 350k | Jan 9 to Jan 15 |\n| 0x49bf093277bf4dde49c48c6aa55a3bda3eedef68 | LP | 150k | 16th |\n| 0x407cff84eeaacda390fe302c99fa5dd32521bc53 | Holding | 400k | 16th |\n| 0xe31deacee1770dfa56f8849724bcb7f8e5f76ef2 | LP | 130k | 16th |\n| 0xf7ca1f0ff0995c84fef530f7c74c69fb80331e81 | Perp | 200k | 16th |\n| 0x9644a6920bd0a1923c2c6c1dddf691b7a42e8a65 | Perp+LP | 750k | 16th |\n| 0xfd81b27d9796a1ba7d7171ea70010c9befb2a62a | Perp | 380k | 17th |\n\n### Peg Dynamics and Mechanism Design\n\nAn analysis of the peg and utilization dynamics revealed that the deviation can be attributed to a combination of multiple factors, including traders profiting from the Synthetix Perpetual platform, the lack of interest rate on sUSD debt in an environment of heightened rates, and the ongoing migration to Synthetix V3 which reduces the demand for sUSD. This created an imbalance as this excess supply was not met with proportional demand, putting downward pressure on the price of sUSD. This conclusion is supported by the increase in sUSD’s market cap, which closely followed the downward price deviation and the growth in interest rates.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151807.732.png](ipfs://bafybeicynmyw2iywjymc2s6lbeyjbavpcvsdwnqpwxoz2fnd3av36u3kkm)\nWhile this behavior does not pose a risk to sUSD’s fundamental backing, the exit of sUSD’s price from its concentrated liquidity range reduced buy-side liquidity, thereby increasing Aave's risk to sUSD positions. This liquidity constraint underpinned the recommendation to reduce caps, aiming to mitigate Aave's risk.\n\n### Removing sUSD as Collateral\n\nWith the recent deterrence of the creation of new sUSD debt on Aave and continued minimized supply exposure, the majority of outstanding debt is fundamentally leveraged to explicitly contribute to the recent sUSD incentive programs by minimizing effective peg exposure. However, while highly overcollateralized, the current economics associated with the soft peg mechanism is fundamentally shaky; minimizing the usage of sUSD as collateral is recommended to be performed as a preventive measure. The current distribution of such sUSD-collateralized stablecoin debt positions is highly conservative, as can be seen below, thereby requiring a significant depeg to start to contribute negatively to the Aave protocol, and the expectation is such that exposure will continue to be minimized over time, as has been the case with a 3M reduction in supply on Aave (25%) over the last 7 days.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151810.268.png](ipfs://bafkreichtqxkc33sgfqdmovkfkb52lal52eksh3ynamdjoghnkt333o3fe)\n![image - 2025-01-30T151812.842.png](ipfs://bafkreifmjwarbys4s3iecgetat2nmeyxp22qa4r7jyjbsru2qlrrpapvdy)\nMoreover, during a swift depeg event 7 months ago, we proposed an immediate LTV0 change due to the deprecation of their spot synths contributing to significant downward pressure, as can be seen [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719). The fundamental characteristics of the asset eventually improved once more through mechanical changes on Synthetix’s side in the redemption process, leading to the unfreezing of the asset, as seen in [this](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-parameter-recommendations-susd-on-v3-optimism-05-23-2024/17779) post. However, we continued to reduce exposure in the form of decreasing caps significantly coupled with decreasing LTV/LTs in both the general market and E-Mode configuration, leading to a more conservative state. As such, a significant buffer of 6% price movement already exists between the collateral value at the LT and the bad debt threshold of 1/(1+LB) in e-mode itself.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo further improve this safety buffer and given the conservative distribution of collateralized debt positions throughout the stablecoin E-Mode config on Optimism, we recommend decreasing the LTV/LT in Stablecoins E-Mode while minimizing induced liquidations.\n\nConsidering the current positioning within the E-Mode, we estimate the optimal LT reduction to be 87%. While we intend to deprecate the E-Mode and remove sUSD from it progressively, this change poses an initial step in that direction. Chaos Labs will monitor the market and introduce additional Liquid E-Modes if demand for a stablecoin-correlated E-Mode remains.\n\nThe change to 87% LT is expected to cause the liquidation of just $95K of collateral.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151815.223.png](ipfs://bafkreihlu36ppeeaml3zkpfe7vuf2iqfakfent4yzb2n3i3xqnpw7ixwpm)\nThe liquidations caused at the recommended LT are primarily stablecoins with significant liquidity to support the minimal liquidation size, with sUSD liquidations only representing $2.4K, or 3.2%.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151817.770.png](ipfs://bafkreieomtso2cfoswuhmg6ehmc4sdsxd3wrrdtgicbzd57u44tgetqlmu)\nAdditionally, we recommend setting the LTV of sUSD outside of the Stablecoin Correlated E-Mode to 0; this measure will prevent additional borrowing from being performed using sUSD as collateral, hence limiting the future risk posed by an sUSD downward deviation. \n\nThis measure will simultaneously apply to both sUSD parameters within and outside of the E-Mode, hence limiting the opening of new positions.\n\nFollowing an improvement of the sUSD peg and a reduction in sUSD-denominated collateral, Chaos Labs will reinstate the borrow cap to a defined value determined by our methodology.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the sUSD asset on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Asset | Deployment | Current LTV | Rec. LTV |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sUSD | Optimism | 60.00% | 0.00% |\n\nFor the Stablecoin E-Mode on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Rec. Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LTV | 90.00% | 0.00% |\n| LT | 93.00% | 87.00% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.\n\nWith market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.\n\nDo note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.\n\n| Asset | Current RF| Recommended RF | \n| ---  | ---    |---     |\n| 1INCH| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| AMPL | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BUSD | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BAL  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| BAT  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CRV  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CVX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| DAI  | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| DPI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENS  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENJ  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FEI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FRAX | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| GUSD | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| KNC  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| LINK | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| LUSD | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| MANA | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| MKR  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| RAI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| REN  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| renFIL| 35.00%| 99.99% |\n| SNX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| sUSD | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| SUSHI| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| TUSD | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| UNI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| USDC | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| USDP | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| USDT | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| UST  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| wBTC | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| wETH | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| YFI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ZRX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n4) Subsequent AIP submission are expected to follow every 14 days thereafter\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "# **Follow-up post-DSR increase to 15% APR**\n\nFollowing the [recent increase](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-out-of-schedule-executive-vote-increase-edsr-increase-stability-fees-decrease-gsm-delay-usdc-psm-throughput-change-trigger-spark-proxy-spell-march-8-2024) in sDAI APR from 5% to 15%, aimed at maintaining adequate DAI demand and alleviating DAI selling pressure in the current risk-on market, we anticipate stablecoin rates to rise significantly above the initially proposed slope1 values due to the rate arbitrage opportunity. Therefore, we are revising our initial \"conservative\" and \"aggressive\" slope1 recommendations accordingly.\n\nOur updated \"conservative\" value will be set at 12%, assuming that rates will revert to a longer-term mean similar to current levels. This adjustment considers the effective cost and anticipates the closure of existing DAI CDPs due to increased stability fees alongside the rising demand for sDAI deposits. As a result, sDAI rates are expected to revert or gradually decrease over time. While this is still a significant increase, the current trend in stablecoin rates suggests a need for a middle ground to align with the short-term expected rate hike. This is particularly relevant given the unexpected duration until the aforementioned rate decreases, considering the size of the MakerDAO reserves.\n\nOur recommendation of 14% for slope1 implies a convergence towards the expected yield of sDAI, aimed at mitigating short-term rate volatility and discouraging deviations above UOptimal. If the yield on sDAI decreases or the market-priced stablecoin rate reverts to a decreased value, we will adjust slope1 accordingly.\n\n# Adjusted Recommendations\n\n| Market | Asset | Current Slope1 | Rec Slope1 Conservative | Rec Slope1 Aggressive |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | FRAX | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | sUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | GUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | LUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDP | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | FRAX | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | LUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | pyUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Ethereum V3 | crvUSD | 5% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V2 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | MAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Avalanche V3 | FRAX | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V2 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | MAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | EURA | 4% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | EURS | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDC.e | 7% | 13% | 15% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | sUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | LUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | MAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDC.e | 7% | 13% | 15% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC.e | 7% | 13% | 15% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | DAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | LUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | FRAX | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | MAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | EURS | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Base V3 | USDbC | 7% | 13% | 15% |\n| Base V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Metis V3 | USDC | 6% | No Change | No Change |\n| Metis V3 | USDT | 6% | No Change | No Change |\n| BNB Chain V3 | USDT | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| BNB Chain V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| BNB Chain V3 | FDUSD | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Scroll V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Gnosis V3 | sDAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Gnosis V3 | WXDAI | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n| Gnosis V3 | USDC | 6% | 12% | 14% |\n# Increase Uoptimal to 92% for USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum V3\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe recent surge in both supply and demand in stablecoin markets, combined with the limited use of supplied stablecoins as collateral, provides an opportunity to enhance capital efficiency in the market. This enhancement is facilitated by the substantial increase in slope1 to align rates with market demand, achieved by raising the optimal utilization (Uoptimal) from 90% to 92%. Empirical data supports this proposal, as detailed below.\n\n### Historical Stablecoin Utilization as Collateral\n\nTo evaluate the feasibility of increasing UOptimal to improve capital efficiency, we examine the proportion of supplied stablecoins utilized as collateral. This analysis is critical because liquidations necessitate ample liquidity, and any adjustment to UOptimal must offer a suitable buffer to prevent the system from encountering excessively high utilization rate ranges.\n\nBelow, we present a time series of USDC, USDT, and DAI utilization as collateral relative to the total supplied value at a given time t. This metric quantifies the total dollar value of volatile debt collateralized by these stablecoins, providing insights into the relative \"health\" of the market and the potential effects of any theoretical upward price movement in the underlying debt asset.\n\n\n\n### Liquidations\n\nOver the last 90 days, despite ETH doubling in price, only $1.8 million worth of collective USDC, USDT, and DAI collateral has been seized through liquidations on Ethereum V3, with 61% of this value originating from DAI collateral. This amount represents just 0.1% of all currently supplied USDT, USDC, and DAI, indicating minimal leverage employed against stablecoins overall.\n\n### Account Distribution\n\nThe dispersion of supplied stablecoin assets is a crucial metric in defining the user experience of stablecoin suppliers, ensuring ample liquidity for them to withdraw all or most of their supply according to the defined Uoptimal. Additionally, the concentration of debt backed by stablecoin collateral gauges the potential for some users to withdraw or get liquidated, which could lead to a significant shock in the system. Plotting the distribution of total supplied USDC, USDT, and DAI on a per-account basis, we observe a healthy distribution, with the majority of supplied accounts employing zero debt, resulting in an infinite health factor.\n\n\n### Historical Utilization Rate\n\nIn the last three months, the utilization rate has consistently remained above the current Uoptimal by approximately 0.5% to 2%, as depicted by the 7-day moving average of the utilization rate. Currently, yield convergence is observed at a 91.5% to 92% utilization rate, considering the current slope1 value of 6%. This trend is primarily attributed to the exceptionally high USDe speculative yields and the general demand for stable leverage in an upward market. The recent jump, however, can additionally be attributed to the increase in the sDAI rate to 15%.\n\nBased on the data regarding the utilization and distribution of stablecoin collateral presented above, we propose increasing UOptimal to 92% for USDC, USDT and DAI on Aave V3 Ethereum. This adjustment, coupled with an elevated slope1, aims to maintain market competitiveness and reduce volatility in the stablecoin market.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Current Uoptimal | Recommended Uoptimal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USDC | 90% | 92% |\n| USDT | 90% | 92% |\n| DAI | 90% | 92% |",
