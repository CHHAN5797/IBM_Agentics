With a TVL of approximately $5 billion, BNB Chain is the third-largest chain by TVL. The chain has a diverse array of DeFi offerings, including prominent projects like PancakeSwap, Venus, and several others. Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain has the potential to benefit both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and the potential for additional revenue. BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. Suggested risk parameters for each asset are provided in the table below. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\n| Risk Parameter | BNB | WBTC | BETH | WETH | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 65% | 70% | 60% | 80% | 82.5% | 70% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 75% | 70% | 82.5% | 85% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10% | 10% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 8.5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 15% | 15% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | N/A | 80.000 | 20,000,000 | 20.000.000 |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 | 5,000 | 20,000 | 100,000 | 50,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 75% | 45% | 45% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 6.1% | 7% | 7% | 4.8% | 4% | 4% |\n| Slope2 | 100% | 300% | 300% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this Temperature Check proposal.

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Base\n\nAuthor: @fig - Flipside Crypto\n\nDate: 2023-05-22\n\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check seeks the community's input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Base mainnet, expanding Aave to a unique, OP-stack network.\n\n## Background\n\nBase is an open-source, developer-friendly L2 EVM blockchain, built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack. Base is incubated inside of Coinbase and will serve as both a home for Coinbase’s on-chain products and a sandbox for permissionless development.\n\nCoinbase has partnered with Optimism throughout the inception and launch of Base to help realize the Optimism superchain vision. Base testnet is currently live — and mainnet soon around the corner.\n\nDocs are available at [docs.base.org](https://docs.base.org/)\n\nIts mission and identity are stated clearly in the docs: ***Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users to web3.***\n\nAs a core developer, Coinbase will collaborate with OP Labs in contributing to the Optimism Collective’s mission of extending the OP Stack as a public good. Moreover, as a chain, Base will commit a portion of its transaction fee revenue to the Optimism Collective treasury.\n\nFour key principles have shaped Base that will continue to guide its approach:\n\n\n**Open-source**\n\nBase is built on the MIT-licensed [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. Coinbase is joining as the second Core Dev team working on the OP Stack to ensure it’s a public good available to everyone.\n\n\n\n\n**A bridge, not an island**\n\nBase is optimized for easy, secure access to Ethereum L1, other L2s, as well as other L1 ecosystems like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos. Builders and users may start on Base, but go everywhere Base is a “bridge” for users into the crypto economy.\n\n\n\n**Decentralization** \n\n Decentralization is essential for the crypto economy \"to remain open, global, and accessible to everyone.” Coinbase is deeply committed to progressing toward full decentralization over the years ahead.\n\n\n**For everyone**\n\nBase is a vision to be an open ecosystem, seeded with Coinbase products, users, and assets. Coinbase is working with the broader community to bring the chain to life.\n\n \nBase has launched with a diverse array of launch partners, servicing different developer and user needs across data, block explorers, bridging, custody, DeFi, and others.\n\nPlease see the list below of robust launch partners:\n\n \n![dd6a532ab00053c11ed6070d651915f493105e81_2_1380x712.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihs7se4xncwxlk4lrb3t4lkcsx2o2gkjqj6pt6rxplamuho5b2znm)\n    \n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave community has voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase across other prominent L2s such as Arbiturm, Metis, and Optimism.\n\nBy enabling Base on Aave, it creates valuable (and differentiated) revenue opportunities for Aave, capturing the growth and interest of users who live on the Coinbase platform.\n\nBase is a way for Aave to instantly leverage Coinbase’s products and distribution: seamless Coinbase integrations, fiat onramps, and access to **110mm+** users and **$80B+** assets in the Coinbase ecosystem.\n\nIn the first week of Base, 18k developers deployed 55k smart contracts on testnet. This activity sustained through the network's announcement has the potential to introduce new, valuable users to DeFi and Aave.\n\nSince Base's testnet launch on 02/23/2023, metrics illustrate strong activity:\n\n* 2,000,000 accounts created\n* 17,000,000 transactions\n* 1,000,000+ addresses holding a Base Builder NFT for participating in in Quests\n\nIn addition, Base has shown impressive retention for a blockchain, with ~70,000 unique wallets returning to Base for subsequent transactions within one day. The users, likely early developers, paint a promising outlook for the activity that may be seen on mainnet.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis *TEMP CHECK* presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Base mainnet on day one of its launch.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for this asset are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers (@Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of the token.\n\n|||||||\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|**Risk Parameter**|**wETH**|**USDC**|**wstETH**|**cbETH**||\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|NO|NO||\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|YES|YES||\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES||\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A||\n|Loan To Value|N/A|82.5%|70.0%|67.0%||\n|Liquidation Threshold|80%|85%|79%|74%||\n|Liquidation Bonus|82.5%|5%|7.2%|7.5%||\n|Reserve Factor|5%|10%|15%|15%||\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|10%|10%||\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|940|1200||\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|6000|10000||\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|0|0||\n|uOptimal|45%|80%|45%|45%||\n|Base|0%|0%|0.25%|0%||\n\n\n\nBase will deploy using the [Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/tree/master/data), which an overview can be found [here](https://static.optimism.io/#adding-a-token-to-the-list).

This testnet deployment was done for testing purposes by the @AaveCompanies team.\n\nSince ZkEVM is EVM-equivalent, deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work.\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative supports L2 diversity as part of its governance platform.\n\nThis minimal Aave V3 deployment, with strictly limited assets onboarding (”MVP V3”), can be an opportunity to establish a strategic Aave presence early in this new network while staying conservative in terms of risk.\n\nThis ARFC proposal should be considered as a \"temperature check\" that would allow development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the zkEVM network.\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to “temp check” the deployment of a MVP version of Aave V3 on the ZkEVM L2.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe proposal to deploy Aave V3.0.1 on the ZkEVM L2 network, also known as \"MVP V3,\" presents an opportunity for Aave Governance to establish a strategic presence on this new network early on. Aave has a history of pioneering in new frontiers, starting with the Polygon & Avalanche V2 deployment in 2021.\n\nZkEVM is an L2 solution developed by the Polygon team that is EVM-equivalent. Deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work. However, to reduce risk, the proposal suggests limiting asset onboarding and setting conservative risk parameters. This will enable development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the ZkEVM network. The proposal recommends onboarding only three collaterals (WETH, WMATIC & USDC) and one borrowable asset (USDC) to reduce risk exposure.\n\nIt is important to note that the presented risk parameters should be considered as suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\nThis proposal also lays the groundwork for an \"MVP\" L2 GHO facilitator if governance considers this option in the future.\n\nOverall, this proposal has the potential to expand Aave's reach in the DeFi space by allowing it to expand to new \"frontier\" networks.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy an “MVP V3” of Aave V3.0.1 with only three collaterals: WETH, WMATIC & USDC, and only one borrowable asset: USDC.\n\n| Risk Parameter | WETH | MATIC | USDC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES |\n| Stable borrowing | N/A | N/A | NO |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 65% | 82.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 70% | 85% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 10% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | 20,000,000 |\n| Supply Cap | 25,000 | 15,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 7% | 6.1% | 4% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% | 75% | 90% |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 100% | 60% |\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by Polygon for publishing this AFRC.\n\nHowever, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, is a compensated DeFi strategy advisor for the Polygon Foundation. Although this AFRC is not specifically part of his role, it could be interpreted as such.\n\nAs part of its delegate platform, the ACI promotes L2 diversity.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Marc Zeller holds MATIC, the native asset of the Polygon protocol, and MaticX, a LSD of MATIC, as well as significant holdings on the Polygon POS blockchain, worth approximately $250k.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",
