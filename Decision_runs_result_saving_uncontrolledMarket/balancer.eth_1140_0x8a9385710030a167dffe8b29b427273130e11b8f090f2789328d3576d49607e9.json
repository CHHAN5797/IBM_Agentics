USDX captures yield from crypto-native sources and distributes it back to its users.\n* sUSDX is a staked version of USDX; yield for sUSDX currently stands around 10%.\n* USDT is a fiat-backed USD-denominated stablecoin, issued by Tether.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n* Stables Labs has recently concluded Season 1 of its points campaign, and saw rapid increase in its TVL. Our previous collaboration with Balancer has proven extremely effective, as our sUSDX/USDX became Balancer v2 Arbitrum's biggest pool (TVL ~$10M). sUSDX/USDX/aUSDT Balancer v3 pool will allow users to enjoy greater yield, and deep pool of liquidity to swap through.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance**: currently owned by 0x3f9a06aD4c83c289DF83461fE5F24EE4c4491935 (3 out of 4 multisig).\n2. **Oracles**: The protocol does not reply on external oracles.\n3. **Audits**: [link](https://1166152427-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F5mdBNVoaU0Rn0IEZP0Y1%2Fuploads%2FAGLbaiVubfT1xuY1FdmH%2FBlocksec_Security_Audit_Report_for_USDX.pdf?alt=media&token=6326b906-c1b4-49cd-b670-666baee5d030).

With increased TVL, usdx.money is committed to building robust liquidity for sUSDX/USDX and USDX/USDT pairs on Arbitrum Chain to facilitate secondary liquidity for USDX and sUSDX.

        "body": "PR with Payload:\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1438\n\n**Summary**\n> This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge on Polygon PoS for a GYD/aUSDT E-CLP. \n\n**References/Useful links**\n\n> Links\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\n>* GYD is a USD denominated meta-stablecoin, issued by [Gyroscope](https://gyro.finance/).\n>* USDT is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by [Tether](https://tether.to/en/). aUSDT is the yield-bearing deposit receipt token for lending out USDT on Aave, in a static wrapper.\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\n> GYD is launching on Polygon PoS. This is a core pool to enable initial liquidity.\n\n**Specification**\n \n>1. **Governance:** The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n>\n>\n>2. **Oracles:** \n> * ‘rateProvider0’: [0x9977a61a6aa950044d4dcD8aA0cAb76F84ea5aCd](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9977a61a6aa950044d4dcD8aA0cAb76F84ea5aCd) and relevant [review](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/statATokenLMRateProvider.md)\n> *  ‘rateProvider1’: 0x00\n>\n>3. **Audits:** Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production since November 2022.\n>\n>4. **Centralization vectors:** No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n>\n>5. **Market History:** This is the first GYD pool on Polygon PoS.\n>\n>6. **Value:** This pool is intended to better match the historic prices and low volatility of the included tokens. \n\n#### Contracts\n\n> * E-CLP: [0xa8CbbfFE0d62797AFAF7af0A23810bd5ba39a4dD](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xa8CbbfFE0d62797AFAF7af0A23810bd5ba39a4dD)\n>* Child Gauge on Polygon: [0xCC322077D4056739FC11E950326b2a97aEcB0cc8](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xCC322077D4056739FC11E950326b2a97aEcB0cc8)\n>* Root Gauge on Ethereum: [0x8E4debFB047eFCF6501665160739818E90eD621F](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8E4debFB047eFCF6501665160739818E90eD621F)\n\n\n#### Specification\n\n\n>Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>gauge(address): `0x8E4debFB047eFCF6501665160739818E90eD621F`\n>gaugeType(string): `Polygon`",
