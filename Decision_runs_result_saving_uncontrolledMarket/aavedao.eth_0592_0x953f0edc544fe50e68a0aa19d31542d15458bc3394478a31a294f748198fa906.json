This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled.  \n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, $279k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the more conservative of the two risk service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.56B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.81B) and ETH ($1.39B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Arbitrum. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and $279k during January 2023.\n\n\n\n\nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum. The parameters shown below are a combination of Gauntlet’s and Chao’s work and utilise the same interest rate proposed by Llama for wstETH on Arbitrum.\n\n\nGauntlet’s and Chao’s combined but differing risk assessments can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-arbitrum-aave-v3/11387/7).\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled| Yes|\n|Supply Cap (in tokens)| 1,200|\n|Borrow Cap (in tokens)| 190|\n|Debt Ceiling| 0|\n|LTV| 70.0%|\n|LT| 79.0%|\n|Liquidation Bonus| 7.2%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee |10%|\n\n\n### ETH eMode Category\n\n\n|Category|Assets Included|Loan to Value|Liquidation Threshold|Liquidation Bonus|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ethereum Correlated|wstETH wETH|90%|93%|2%|\n\n\n### Borrow Rates\n\n\n|Category|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Slope1|4.50%|\n|Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

MKR token holders govern the Maker Protocol, the smart contracts that power DAI. There is currently $12.71m of MKR deposited into Aave v2 on Ethereum. This proposal grants Aave the opportunity to list the governance token of the community supporting DAI which contributes $167m of TVL on the Ethereum v2 deployment.\n\nThis ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting.\n\n# Motivation\n\nMaker DAO has over $7.45B in TVL and is ranked second on Defi Llama TVL rankings. The Maker Protocol is only deployed on the Ethereum network. The stable coin DAI, provides $167m of deposits into Aave v2 on Ethereum, with over $103m of this supply being borrowed by users.\n\nThe risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlet’s original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don’t create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates.\n\nWe note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: MKR\n\nContract Address: [0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|65.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|70.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|8.50%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,500|\n|Supply Cap|6,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|$2,500,000|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n\nNote: Stable borrowing is disabled, however parameters are provided in case stable borrowing is enabled at a later date without amending any parameters.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Add BAL Ethereum v3\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consultants & @solarcurve (Balancer DAO)\nDated: 2023-01-31\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard BAL to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nBAL is a strategic asset to Aave and any BAL earned from the pool could be used by Aave to bootstrap the adoption of GHO and/or the new aToken being developed by @AaveCompanies.\n\nThe risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the [initial forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nListing BAL as a priority for Aave v3 reflects the strategic relationship between the two communities. Balancer and Aave completed a [200,000 BAL for AAVE token swap](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/) and Aave later purchased an additional [100,000 BAL via a swap contract](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115/). With the launch of [GHO ](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-development-update/10267)getting closer and the [new aToken](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406) from @AaveCompanies currently in queue for audit, the potential use cases for veBAL are numerous.\n\nDue to the potential use cases for veBAL in supporting bootstrap the growth of Aave, the BAL token is considered a strategic asset. Therefore, we believe listing BAL on Aave v3 Ethereum is a priority.\n\nBalancer DAO is a large provider of liquidity on Ethereum v2 and also Polygon v3. A proposal by @llamaxyz for Balancer to deposit [additional BAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-164-deposit-bal-into-aave-polygon-v3/4295) into Polygon v3, up to the current SupplyCap, was recently approved by Balancer DAO.\n\n![\\ 301x183](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TZTd4ME5QCWDn4QEX1LBlBXodWExL-NKJMrKaB3MDQGtixZhk9cNhtChax0ZV11SvSvtcALlWCPOG2wVUC0dGAHjKeB5baY2unhodAufQt51ONoZSTBOTFPVEXDvRg_O6HYu9Z3WydTumJUSHk8t5l0) ![\\ 303x181](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6KxbH6MUdPdvoU4PbSKSutQZbnkfVtwj7cVpfWhSix3-vC8AF9zllQt4sp6P8nP4jmRcJ3KRs0Of1CPtBqCfPCd8OaAgHVAZSFlDYxskkHfL2S_oECl5NqL-6ex0S7RhSeHVnhmQDk66_865w0PXA-M)\n\nFor listing BAL, this proposal uses risk parameters suggested by Gauntlet on the original [[ARC] Aave v3 Ethereum Deployment: Assets and Configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) post. The interest rate curve parameters have been sourced from @Llamaxyz’s [[ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484) post, which has passed through Snapshot.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: BAL\n\nContract Address: [0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|57%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|62%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|8.3%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|185k|\n|Supply Cap|700k|\n|Debt Ceiling|2.9m|\n|Variable Base|3%|\n|Variable Slope1|14%|\n|Variable Slope2|150%|\n|Uoptimal|80%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|20%|\n|Stable Slope2|150%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20|\n\nNote: Stable borrowing is disabled, however parameters are provided in case enabled at a later date without amending other parameters specific to stable borrowing.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Add UNI to Ethereum v3\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@matthewgraham), ACI (@MarcZeller) and 3SE\nDated: 2023-02-18\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard UNI to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe UNI token is the governance token of the Uniswap ecosystem and is a DeFi bluechip. UNI was one of the first governance tokens to be integrated into the Aave ecosystem when it was listed on v1 and was included on Aave v2 when it was launched in December 2020.\n\nThis ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUniswap is a DEX with $4.18B in TVL, second only to Curve Finance with $5.06B, according to Defi Llama’s data. Uniswap is deployed on five networks. UNI provides Aave v2 with $15.86m of TVL. Something to note, it is possible with Aave v3 to delegate Aave’s UNI reserve holding governance influence to an address which can be used for voting on Uniswap proposals.\n\nThe risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlet’s original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don’t create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates.\n\nWe note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback to be incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: UNI\n\nContract Address: [0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|65.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|77.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|500,000 units|\n|Supply Cap|2,000,000 units|\n|Debt Ceiling|$17,000,000|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n\nNote: Stable borrowing is disabled, however parameters are provided in case stable borrowing is enabled at a later date without amending any parameters.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
