        "body": "title: [ARFC] Freeze BUSD on Aave V2\n\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n\nDated: 2023-02-13\n\nSummary\nFollowing the recent developments between Paxos (minter of BUSD) and the SEC,\n\nPaxos will stop minting BUSD From the 21st of February 2023, and will only allow redemption for their underlying value by burning BUSD.\n\nThe circulating supply of BUSD will thus trend toward zero over time.\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to freeze BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\nAbstract\nThis ARFC proposes to freeze the BUSD reserve on the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\nMotivation\nWhile BUSD is not an asset with borrowing power, and recent development does not present risks of excess debt, From the 21st of February 2023, the circulating supply of this asset will eventually go toward zero.\n\nAs there’s no real prospect of growth and the inability to mint new BUSD might hurt peg arbitrage opportunity and asset peg. It seems that the most reasonable path for Aave is to freeze this reserve and invite users to switch to another stablecoin among the diversity present in Aave.\n\nAs there’s no immediate risk for the protocol, the ACI doesn’t call for a fast-track process for this ARFC, and the standard governance process seems fit.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: BUSD (BUSD)\n\nContract Address: 0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53\n\nDisclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not linked to nor paid by Binance/Paxos to publish this ARFC\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",

        "body": "## Summary:\nThis ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation if the following conditions are met:\n\nThe proposal is provided by a risk service provider or has received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\nThe proposed cap change is not greater than a 100% increase of the current cap or the implementation of a cap.\nThe cap is being decreased.\nThe AIP is implementing a FreezeReserve().\nFor other situations, the normal governance process is applicable.\n\nThis framework is intended for All V3 liquidity pools. Relative to freezing reserves, this framework is intended for all Aave pools.\n\n## Motivation:\nSupply and borrow caps are important safety features of Aave V3, and they are essential for maintaining the stability of the platform. However, these caps can also have a significant impact on the growth potential of the platform. If a cap ceiling is met and governance takes too much time to adapt, this can slow down the growth of the platform and limit its ability to meet the needs of its users.\n\nGiven the importance of supply and borrow caps, it is essential to have a governance process in place that can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions. A long-term viable solution would be a clear framework and the election via governance of a Risk Council having a degree of Risk management capability over the Aave protocol. However, while the definition and implementation of this is technically allowed by the Aave codebase, it is still immature.\n\nAs a temporary buffer, this ARFC proposes a direct to AIP vote for cap changes or FreezeReserve() implementation under certain conditions to increase the efficiency of the governance process. By streamlining the governance process in this way, we can ensure that the platform can quickly and efficiently adapt to changing market conditions and meet the needs of its users.\n\n## Specification:\nAs there’s no need for on-chain AIP or technical implementation for this ARFC, the outcome of a snapshot vote will be considered canon.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe author of this ARFC, Marc Zeller, is the founder of the Aave Chan Initiative and owns AAVE tokens. However, the ACI is not paid by the Aave Companies nor any other entity to submit this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This proposal intends to increase the CRV Supply Cap on Polygon v3 deployment, improve the capital efficiency of each liquidity pool, and increase the amount of revenue generated across the various CRV reserves.\n\nCapital efficiency is improved by increasing the Uoptimal value. Revenue is increased by introducing a Base interest rate, doubling the interest rate at the Uoptimal point, and aligning the Reserve Factor to 20% across all pools. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and significantly reduce the amount of free CRV in aggregate across the Reserves.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith the CRV Reserve on Polygon reaching its Supply Cap, this is an ideal time to implement an upgrade that addresses the Supply Cap and Interest Rate parameters. The current CRV Interest Rate reflects the original parameters implemented when the liquidity pools were deployed. The Interest Rate Parameters do not take into consideration the alternative use cases for CRV and consequently, Aave has missed out on revenue from the sustained borrowing demand.\n\nLlama expects the sustained borrowing demand to continue due to the veTokenomics construct presenting several opportunities for CRV borrowers to earn yield. In this proposal, the Uoptimal parameter is to be increased from 45% to 80% improving the capital efficiency of the active reserves.\n\n![|602x313](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/s7aDxseIhZFmkcsD1j8tWyQFga-HZk1mNV-uEX12phtadq4WtnSfbKMKd4wMthKXRSsmTdZbuLSta4RlxfCmU14dKTLp4Urcg1tfsfUpFLRS4VOjnGl8-1R1V01W1p2bQuE8h2ugtrkYYDaettYEounjAJLeccwbADoZKgiTIYhUJPiHDy831KtI9Bu8eA)\n\n![|602x251](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dzguCUi1-d2HtOJgrpwv_toQLT1_EWIVv6F481ydAaOHcapkzOJFFCD-UNFvB-MoHkF8hmZ4pcBvOKdah_97j0x1A_0vOl9ZqafUraTwSumo-sipYYnP03K6eqfvq7UnyBDWFrzbC4LAoOeUbQvq9EtkN_yeTnMG39l7GPjjJQ324JcW_mw4r3JB7SVARA)\n\nSpecific to the Polygon v3 deployment, increasing the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will lead to an increase in the Borrow Cap, which is a function of the Supply Cap and Uoptimal parameter.\n\nBorrow Cap = Supply Cap * (Uoptimal + 0.1)\n\nThe new Supply Cap parameter has been prepared by Chaos Labs, 1,125.24. This generates a new Borrow Cap of 1,012.72, [2].\n\nWith borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it will become rational for profit-driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield. This has been playing out with demand on Polygon v3 increasing relative to other deployments.\n\n![|602x220](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6JBjVL3HMRZ4_Bteuv2DluxmvzeGBylyijRmHcH43eLscs8ECgeDSCG6fFcYAlJxAOktJX_DQyw1ZcY5uxJQVugOBaihQFNWNydFXQFmV5QB5VdqTaNYmFobEjYyzRNGvtbzaCgHJ_POCDAgbqqX6KmwoErQYl5k-35AmQMnz9lBK4xB46HdRlEYcl8NSA)\n\n![|602x201](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QamXX3bRroYrZVEbgcF1cytYUAgrXjOXumC0-v84ZL0r0xgRRj1VkV1jBpkyyq2DOlzf3MoV_BWbe25ifn1KyldCL7Nui4Ha4sbo3O6v19ipKGdR1OOa1zWJe-2T5jQEcpYCT6eGWie2R2NcgMQ5-p9hcX0gucEw_yWdVtOaTmgHsZpapnZ5n4vpUfmnbA)\n\n![|602x201](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/iedXQAPBKjRykGaxXYuvs-NvCstapd5YCB-oxREIHJMeLZydPdR_PkSBQrCAzhFRkEDignsnsnjLJcdg9PZF1obv_pfpMr5vULL9CJnPYzJbip1dGRgFAWqj8gzBBex0JaTwbB_nBS5TNgVn9dFmM951luswHEhgW6YG77Ln0DImSRoKa_ksqZR_VR-ncw)\n\nThe interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 44,48% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14%, which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.\n\nIn addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at >0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a CRV interest rate equivalent to the BAL interest rate curve (which has a base 3%, slope 1 = 14%, and slope 2 = 150%).\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n\n![|602x369](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Amrx2pG78HWfKFk3BI02p7HlHcb5BfRB6z6eZe321w8jBJiLJ7iF4LyAKU52uHaz-dwE-4CezkG3KP3CD1w30TxLHdn4B92rsFB2FKt0PXrTbauBmAyqUnshYGY0YjGR5eEMfnWZgO6Hj2OSxa-u8PP0Y35mr7DaPes4Ufz_7Bh-OpM-L_nSwQe_dlcNBw)\n\nThe Reserve Factor on Polygon v3 is to be increased from 10% to 20%, bringing it in line with all other Aave deployments.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the CRV Reserve on Polygon v2, Polygon v3, Ethereum v2 and the soon to be deployed Ethereum v3 liquidity pool.\n\nPolygon v3\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|SupplyCap|937.70K|1,125.24K|\n|BorrowCap|640.44K|1,012.72K|\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|10|20|\n\nPolygon v2 - Frozen\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nEthereum v3 - Not yet deployed\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|NA|80|\n|Base|NA|3|\n|Slope1|NA|14|\n|Slope2|NA|150|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|20|\n\nEthereum v2 - Frozen\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x172370d5cd63279efa6d502dab29171933a610af&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v3-borrow-caps-methodology/10925\n[3] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [3].",

For more details about LUSD please refers to [Aave V2 ARC by @TokenBrice ARC: Add support for LUSD (Liquity) 3)\n\nThis ARC is a joint effort with @Llamaxyz to allow a selection of assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3…\n\n# Motivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Liquity or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the initial forum post 1 discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same than for LUSD in V2. for now the ACI is supportive to onboard LUSD as it was on V2, when the V3 will be more mature, the ACI is supportive to work on AIP to allow usage of LUSD as a collateral.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\n# Specification\nTicker: LUSD\n\nContract Address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0#code\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\tN/A\nBorrow Cap\t1,210k\nSupply Cap\t3,000k\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t80%\nSlope2\t87%\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

    "summary": "The proposal to offboard BUSD from Aave V2 Ethereum market aims to reduce BUSD liquidity and encourage users to switch to other stablecoins through modifications in risk parameters. The timeline metrics show strong early and sustained support for YAE, indicating consensus in favor.

Similar past proposals with analogous goals to adjust market parameters and offboard assets were successful, with positive market and TVL impacts.",
