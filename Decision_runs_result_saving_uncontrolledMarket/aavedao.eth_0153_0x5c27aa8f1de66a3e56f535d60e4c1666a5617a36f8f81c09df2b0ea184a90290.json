        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Deploy 10M GHO into Aave v3 Lido Instance\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-11-05\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nFollowing on from the publication to [Add GHO to the Lido instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-gho-and-migrate-streams-to-lido-instance/19686) of Aave v3 on Ethereum, this publication proposes supporting GHO liquidity by minting and depositing 10M units of GHO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith a [GHO Facilitator](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-deploy-gho-facilitator/19625) expected to be deployed in the near future, this publication proposes Minting 10M Units and depositing GHO into the Lido instance of Aave v3. With the introduction of the facilitator, the Aave DAO is expected to be an early GHO liquidity provider with GHO from the Treasury and newly minted GHO being deposited into the reserve. \n\nIn the near future, a proposal to onboard sUSDe to Lido instance will be presented on the governance forum. Onboarding sUSDe is expected to drive significant demand for stablecoins on the Lido instance. A combination of making available liquidity, having an appropriate Borrow Rate and Borrow Cap enables the GHO Stewards to balance growing GHO's circulating supply and peg resilience. By providing liquidity on the Lido instance, the Aave DAO shall provid the initial bootstrapping liquidity in a very cost efficient manner and in doing so, enahnce the DAO's revenue generated from the Lido instance. GHO holders will be able to deposit GHO to earn the deposit yield whilst benefit from small than otherwise concentration risk within the reserve due to the DAO providing the bootstrapping liquidity.\n\nWith strong demand for GHO using wstETH as collateral resulting in 23.7% of GHO supply sourced from the Main market being backed by wstETH, this demonstrates that users actively seek to benefit from the capital efficiency of using an LST as collateral. Deploying additional GHO into the Lido instance is expected to further encourage this positive behavior, reinforcing the appeal of wstETH as a reliable, yield-bearing collateral for GHO.\n\n![chart illustration (4)|1920x1498](upload://qIys1ADMWsNuiamV1PvLDkwZZff.jpeg)\n\n# Specification\n\n![tokenlogic illustration 1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRhLcIZkx.png)\n\nThe below table details the amount of GHO to be Minted by the Facilitator to be deposited into Lido instance upon, or shortly after, listing GHO. This is to be implemented via two AIP submissions and contain any required Supply Cap increase to facilitate the Aave DAO depositing GHO into the reserve. \n\n| Parameter |   Value    | \n| -------   | :-------:  |\n| Mint      |  10M Units | \n\nThe GHO Stewards are responsible for determining how much and when to mint GHO that is to be deposited into the Lido instance of Aave v3. \n\nFuture proposals shall use the fast track, Direct-to-AIP, process for implementing GHO Steward proposed amendments. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will be submitted to implement the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy GHO Facilitator\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-10-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes creating a Facilitator entity on Ethereum to support GHO's expansion across several decentralised applications on various networks.\n\nThis proposal also includes the first integration, a 5M GHO deposit into Aave v3 on Arbitrum. Future proposals shall outline how and where GHO shall be deployed. \n\n# Motivation\n\nGHO was successfully launched on Arbitrum July 2nd 2024 with only the CCIP Bridge Facilitator on Arbitrum. Since then, growth has stalled with around 3% of GHO's supply located on Arbitrum.\n\nThis publication proposes creating a new Facilitator entity on Ethereum for the purpose of onboarding newly minted GHO to various applications on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Avalanche and other networks as GHO expands. \n\nUsing Aave v3 on Arbitrum as an example, the below provides a high level overview of the flow:\n\n* GHO is Minted on Ethereum;\n* Transferred to Arbitrum via the CCIP bridge; and,\n* GHO is deposited into Aave v3 on Arbitrum.\n\nThe facilitator will enable Aave DAO to onboard new GHO demand vectors while segregating risk from the existing Ethereum facilitator.\n\nThe new facilitator role will have independent minting and bucket capacity constraints specific to supporting each proposed integration.\n\nCollateralization of minted GHO will depend on the different use-cases and takes place on the respective dApp when users bring GHO into the circulating supply.\n\nBeyond an initial 5M of GHO being proposed for deployment into Aave v3 on Arbitrum, other destination(s) for newly Minted GHO are to be presented in separate [TEMP CHECK] proposals for Aave DAO approval. An example, a [TEMP CHECK] would be to Mint GHO to be deposited into a GHO Reserve on Aave v3 Lido instance.\n\n## Aave v3 Arbitrum \n\nAn initial 5M units of GHO be deposited into the existing GHO Reserve on Aave v3 on Arbitrum. The below image shows the overall flow of GHO from Eth to Arb and into Aave v3. \n\n![tokenlogic illustration 2|1920x1042](upload://q2K20iwUi5poiuQ9CUUCDH4qqH1.jpeg)\n\nDepositing 5M of GHO represents a ~22% of the GHO liquidity in the reserve and is expected to dilute the deposit rate and reduce the borrow rate. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-10-29 at 22.09.07|1650x158](upload://zpzHzakLKAXc3of28V9gFgh4WYO.png)\n\nUsers will then respond and a new equilibrium is found. After monitoring how the market reacts to this change, a separate proposal will detail any additional GHO to be minted and deposited into the reserve.\n\nTo ensure there is sufficient capacity in the GHO reserve, the Risk Stewards will increase the GHO Supply Cap as required to facilitate GHO being deposited.\n\nThe Aave DAO is to be the sole beneficiary of any revenue generated from GHO deposited into Aave. \n\nA separate proposal shall be required to deposit additional GHO into the reserve at a later date. \n\n## Specification \n\nThe below serves as a guide and is to be refined with input from Risk Service Providers during the ARFC stage of the governance process. \n\n| Parameter  |     Value          | \n|    -------     |     :-------:      |\n| Bucket Cap |     50M units  |\n| Mint Cap     |      5M Units   | \n\nThe GHO Stewards are to be responsible for determining when and how much to increase the GHO Mint Capacity and Bucket Capacity whilst using the fast track, Direct-to-AIP, process for implementing the proposed amendments. \n\nThe facilitator on Ethereum can generate and burn GHO tokens up to a certain bucket size. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.\n\n## **Motivation**:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**:\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with the following assets for collateral: CAKE, BNB, BTCB, WETH, USDC, and USDT. The table below provides the suggested risk parameters for each asset.\n\n|Risk Parameter|CAKE|BNB|BTCB|WETH|USDC|USDT|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|YES|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|NO|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|NO|NO|NO|NO|YES|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|55.00%|70.00%|70.00%|80.00%|77.50%|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|61.00%|75.00%|75.00%|82.50%|80.00%|80.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|5.00%|5.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|20.00%|20.00%|15.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,800,000|42,000|115|3,300.00|20,000,000*|20,000,000*|\n|Supply Cap|5,300,000|46,000|210|6,000.00|50,000,000*|50,000,000*|\n|Debt Ceiling|$10,000,000|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Stable Borrowing|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|uOptimal|45%|45%|45%|80%|90%|80%|\n|Base|0%|0%|0%|1%|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|7%|7%|3.80%|4%|4%|\n|Slope2|300%|300%|300%|80%|60%|75%|\n\n## **Deployment Checklist:**\n\n- Risk service providers feedback ✔\n- BGD Labs [Infrastructure/technical evaluation Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bnb-chain-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/13752)  ✔ \n- Oracle recommendation ✔ ([Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=bnb-chain))\n- The graph support ✔\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance  ✔ \n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~70$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Integrate BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 BNB.\n\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The staked version of USDe, sUSDe, earns yield from the protocol and has high potential for strong borrow demand. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nsUSDe: [0x9d39a5de30e57443bff2a8307a4256c8797a3497](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9d39a5de30e57443bff2a8307a4256c8797a3497)\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nRisk parameters have been provided by Chaos Labs in the ARFC discussion thread. \n\nInitial Risk Parameters are the following:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | Yes |\n| Borrowable | No |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (sUSDe) | 85M |\n| Debt Ceiling |40M |\n| LTV | 72.00% |\n| LT | 75.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 8.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00%|\n|Flashloanable|No|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|Emode|No|\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n[TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-susde-to-aave-v3-on-ethereum/16840)\n[TEMP CHECK Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x3263dbee34f5afe513a1a6c5bcd5207684cee03473e1b3d7616993dbd87ab881)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Ethena and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. Collect community & service providers feedback on this ARFC.\n2. Escalate the proposal to ARFC snapshot stage if feedback is positive.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
