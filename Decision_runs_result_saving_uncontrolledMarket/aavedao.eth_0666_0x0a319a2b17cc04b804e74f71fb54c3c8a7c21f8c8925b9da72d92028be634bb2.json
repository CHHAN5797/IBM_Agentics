        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARC] SD Emission_Admin for Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool\nStaus: Proposal\nAuthor: @llamaxyz @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2022-11-14\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n@llamaxyz proposed assigning the SD `Emission_Admin` role on the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool to a Gnosis Safe controlled by the Stader Labs.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe Stader Labs team intends to distribute SD incentives to the MaticX Reserve on Polygon Aave v3.\n\nIn order to achieve this, the `EmissionManager` contract needs to assign an owner to the `Emission_Admin` permission allowing SD rewards to be distributed, [1,2]. This can only be achieved via the governance process.\n\nThis proposal assigns the `Emission_Admin` permission to SD rewards to the following address `matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a`.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe motivation of the proposal is to enable SD rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\nPlease do note a similar request was submitted enabling the distribution of LDO and stMATIC rewards by Lido and the Polygon Foundation respectively across the Polygon Aave v3 liquidity pool, [3,4].\n\n# Specification\n\nThe Stader Labs team will determine the emission rate and duration SD rewards are offered. This will likely be influenced by the Aave DAO’s ability to adjust the wMATIC and MaticX risk parameters that enable users to generate a return from leverage the MaticX / wMATIC loop.\n\nThe `Emission_Admin` is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The `EmissionManager` role grants the SD `Emission_Admin` role to a specified wallet address. The `Emission_Admin` can distribute SD rewards across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Implementation\n\nSet `Emission_Admin` permission for SD (`matic:0x1d734A02eF1e1f5886e66b0673b71Af5B53ffA94`) on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Stader Lab’s address: `matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a`, [5,6].\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide/rewards#create-proposal\n[2] https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-periphery/blob/master/contracts/rewards/interfaces/IEmissionManager.sol\n[3] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-ldo-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10575/6\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-stmatic-emission-admin-for-polygon-v3-liquidity-pool/10632\n[5] https://polygonscan.com/token/0x1d734a02ef1e1f5886e66b0673b71af5b53ffa94\n[6]  https://gnosis-safe.io/app/matic:0x51358004cFe135E64453d7F6a0dC433CAba09A2a/home\n[7]  https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [7].",

In order to achieve this, the `EmissionManager` contract needs to assign an owner to the `Emission_Admin` permission allowing LDO rewards to be distributed, [1,2]. This can only be achieved via the governance process.\n\nThis proposal assigns the `Emission_Admin` permission to LDO rewards to the following address `0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5`. This address is controlled by Lido.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe motivation of the proposal is to enable LDO rewards to be distributed on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe Lido Liquidity Mining Committee determines the emission rate and duration at which LDO rewards are offered. Standard practice is for the council to meet and determine the next 30 days of LDO rewards on a rolling basis. This means each month, the committee will determine if to extend the LDO rewards, or change the amount of LDO being offered across the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\nThe `Emission_Admin` is not limited to a specified Reserve and is linked to the token being distributed across the Liquidity Pool. The `EmissionManager` determines the LDO `Emission_Admin` and not the stMATIC Reserve. The `Emission_Admin` can distribute LDO anywhere across the Aave v3 Polygon Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Implementation\n\nSet `Emission_Admin` permission for LDO on the Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool to Lido’s address: `0x87D93d9B2C672bf9c9642d853a8682546a5012B5`\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide/rewards#create-proposal\n[2] https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-periphery/blob/master/contracts/rewards/interfaces/IEmissionManager.sol\n[3] https://polygonscan.com/token/0x3a58a54c066fdc0f2d55fc9c89f0415c92ebf3c4\n[4] https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc3c7d422809852031b44ab29eec9f1eff2a58756\n[5] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [5].",

Balancer DAO accrued this stkAAVE after it deposited liquidity into Aave while Liquidity Mining incentives were being distributed, [1,2].\n\nThe Linear Pool’s contract addresses are not capable of recovering or managing the receipt of stkAAVE tokens. As a result, governance intervention is required to change the contract address which can call and receive the stkAAVE.\n\nThe proposal is to implement the changes required to enable Balancer DAO to retrieve the stkaAAVE from the Linear Pools within the Balancer Boosted Aave Pool.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThree Linear Pools within the Balancer Boosted Aave Pool have accrued around 1,500 stkAAVE from Liquidity Mining rewards, [3].\n\nThe Linear Pools are unable to call `getUnclaimedRewards` with `0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8` from the below contracts:\n\n* 0x02d60b84491589974263d922d9cc7a3152618ef6\n* 0xd093fa4fb80d09bb30817fdcd442d4d02ed3e5de\n* 0xf8fd466f12e236f4c96f7cce6c79eadb819abf58\n\nThe Linear Pool holds the aTokens and receives the stkAAVE liquidity mining rewards but can not call the `claimRewards` function or manage any stkAAVE if it was received.\n\nAave enables other addresses to claim on behalf of smart contracts using the `claimOnBehalfOf` function. In order to do this, a specified address must be declared the valid owner of the contract.\n\n# Specification\n\nSet Balancer contract `0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f` as the claimer in the incentives controller contract, [4].\n\n# Implementation\n\nCall setClaimer() for Balancer contracts on INCENTIVES_CONTROLLER_PROXY_ADDRESS\n\nBalancer DAI-aDAI Linear Pool\n\n> https://etherscan.io/address/0x02d60b84491589974263d922d9cc7a3152618ef6#readProxyContract`\n\nBalancer USDC-aUSDC Linear Pool\n\n> https://etherscan.io/address/0xd093fa4fb80d09bb30817fdcd442d4d02ed3e5de#readProxyContract`\n\nBalancer USDT-aUSDT Linear Pool\n\n> https://etherscan.io/address/0xf8fd466f12e236f4c96f7cce6c79eadb819abf58#readProxyContract\n\nIncentives Controller Proxy:\n>https://etherscan.io/address/0xd784927Ff2f95ba542BfC824c8a8a98F3495f6b5#readProxyContract`\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/boosted-pools#linear-pools\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-continue-liquidity-mining-program-on-aave-v2-ethereum-market-and-introduce-liquidity-mining-on-aave-arc-market/7189\n[3] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[4] https://etherscan.io/address/0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARC] Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2022-10-17\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1]. As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode.\n\nThis proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens.\n\nUtilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 72.5%. At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAO’s revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost.\n\nIncreasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300%. Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility.\n\nThe breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative.\n\nThe capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3].\n\nBased upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65%. It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65%. The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZloZ51jG8cSo9pK37apk9xqwSnyM2T6WwKWEaimSNA8sVpcxxsRrQBYPf9F6DAFMzXPdlhRWwNePF_5kZrTEoZu8-rfk3CmDtTivdrrwTTQGrAe-ZoZ1to1PlsAaFfbkmQLeRdOAy0qukls3wJAXFgKgCA6TUd6jP2w6mbO4WWKOguI0RjWEQ7BkIg \"Chart\")\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the wMATIC Reserve.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|75|\n|Base|0|0|\n|Slope1|7|6.1|\n|Slope2|300|100|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx\n[3] https://lido.fi/\n[4] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [4].",

Do note, DPI was not vulnerable to the same potential abuse as xSUSHI was and disabling borrowing was an initial reaction to ensure safety of user’s funds.\n\nThis proposal is to reinstate DPI as an asset that can be borrowed on the Aave markets.\n\n# Motivation\nAt the time when AIP-44 was proposed, Index Coop knew that this attack was never possible for DPI. Index Coop fully supported temporarily suspending the borrowing market out of an abundance of caution.\n\nxSUSHI is vulnerable because SUSHI can be donated to the xSUSHI contract to inflate its value. It is the ability for SUSHI to inflate the xSUSHI value that made the Cream exploit possible. For DPI, this same attack is not possible. This is because Index Coop has its own internal accounting system, which prevents the underlying components from being sent to the contract to inflate its price. The DPI Chainlink oracle uses this internal accounting system to calculate the value of DPI (sum of all parts), ensuring that the DPI price cannot be manipulated in any way.\n\nFor those that are interested the details attaining to the xSUSHI incident on CREAM can be found here and here.\n\nWith a deep understanding of the Cream exploit now widely understood within the broader ecosystem, Index Coop believes it is time to enable borrowing of DPI on the Aave V2 market.\n\n# Specification\nThe recommendation is to enable borrowing and although there are a number of extrinsic use cases for DPI emerging, starting with a utilisation rate of 45%. For Variable Interest Rate parameters, a Base of 0, Slope 1 of 7% and Slope 2 of 300% was selected which is similar to the constituents within DPI. At this point in time, there is no ask for Stable Interest Rate borrowing.\n\nThe details outlining the original specification for listing DPI can be found here, AIP-31 2.
