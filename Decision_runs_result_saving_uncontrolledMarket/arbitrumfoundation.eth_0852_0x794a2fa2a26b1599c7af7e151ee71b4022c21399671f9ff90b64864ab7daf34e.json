The requested ARB grant is a little on the high side given the age and activity of the protocol, however, is justified well enough.\nThey have a nice distribution mechanism that targets LPs to stay for a longer period of time through an escrow mechanism which is great. Their protocol is also rather novel and introduces some interesting opportunities for traders on Arbitrum.\nSome of their KPIs lacked a bit of justification and seemed rather arbitrary. We would’ve also liked to see additional reward mechanisms that target increasing users and trading volume on the platform.\nOverall, given the grant request, novelty, and distribution mechanism, we support Limitless’ application.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nLimitless presented a decent application overall. While it was difficult to verify the data from the Limitless Beta program and their milestones were not trackable at all, their incentive design is very clearly thought out and specifically promotes retention and stickiness. Additionally, the protocol is pretty novel and is a nice addition to the Arbitrum ecosystem. Overall, we believe these factors justify their grant request so we will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\n\"Vote FOR Limitless' proposal.\n\nGood proposal that scored moderately well on rubric. Grant size justification and use of funds is sufficiently incentivized and escrowed approach to lock/vest maintains liquidity post-LTIPP. KPIs are lofty with their current activity numbers and would have liked to see more granular milestones/KPIs over span of the program against their KPIs (TVL, volume, fees) and new ones like # of users.\"",

They provide clear and concise explanations of their milestones, KPIs, and objectives.\nTheir product is innovative and unique and attempts to solve a major problem for one of the largest DeFi categories. We really like their esARB mechanism which should create a notable amount of supply side benefits post LTIPP. Their execution strategy is sound and their TVL estimations and calculations are sufficiently justified.\nUnfortunately, they are a niche product that is complex and may not appeal to a lot of users which is indicated in their lack of adoption. Nonetheless, there still seems to be some baseline of activity.\nTheir requested grant size is on the larger end for their protocol usage, however, given the points above we think it’s sufficiently justified.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThis application largely suffered from being a very large request relative to the TVL and age of the protocol. It would also have benefited from more details around under what conditions or guidelines the incentives would be deployed, as they currently appear to be very discretionary for the applicant. Recommend the applicant resubmit in future grants cycles once there is more history and an initial success to build upon using grant funding.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nGammaSwap presented a strong application, scoring well across most of the rubric. We did feel the grant ask was a little high relative to their TVL, but given the uniqueness to their product we can understand how the protocol may not attract your everyday user. Given the strength and justification of their execution strategy, KPIs, and milestones we are supportive of this proposal to move to a DAO vote.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote FOR GammaSwap's proposal.\n\nGood proposal that scored well across the rubric which sufficient justifications around the grant size, the approach to executing against the plan, and maintaining results after LTIPP. Novel and innovative protocol that provides some degree of differentiation in contrast to the market which supports some of the stickiness considerations. They've demonstrated modest traction and adoption on Arbitrum to \"test the waters\" without incentives, and while the grant size requested is on the higher end in contrast to their TVL (~1-2 thirds of it), believe this is a worthwhile investment from the DAO to scale up adoption based on initial results.",

They have an excellent reputation and strong usage statistics.\nThey provided clear milestones, KPIs, and goals, and provided sufficient justification for their grant size.\nOur main concern is with the overall distribution mechanism and cost to the DAO. We would’ve liked to see a justification of TVL target based on user cohort trade size which would inform how much TVL is required to reduce slippage and attract larger bridging volume. Or even begin bootstrapping in-demand assets to Arbitrum.\nFurthermore, we don’t think spending money on bridge rebates is the best use of DAO funds as it doesn’t actively target increasing user base and activity but mostly reduces the burden for users who were already looking to bridge.\nUnfortunately, due to the reasons above we will not be supporting this application.\n\n*GFX Feedback)*\nThe primary weakness of this grant plan is the sheer size. Given clear execution plan, walking through how the applicant arrived at the requested amount, and milestones, the application overcomes the penalty for the large request. We recommend approving this grant.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\n\nWe are generally supportive of approving Hop’s grant. Hop Protocol is a substantial player in the bridge sector and has huge potential to help Arbitrum grow generally. Bridges are also sites of high crosschain traffic, so this provides an opportunity to put Artbiutrm in front of new users. The detailed breakdown of how the grant will be utilized, including specific percentages allocated to different aspects such as liquidity mining incentives, gas fee subsidies, and bonder fee subsidies, demonstrates a clear understanding of the challenges and opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The plan to incentivize user \"stickiness\" by subsidizing onboarding fees while ensuring a stake in the network through ARB token rebates is particularly innovative and likely to achieve long-term engagement. They, are also open to match the grants funds with the HOP protocol DAO treasury funds which is a good sign. \n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nHop presented a strong application that scored well on most sections in this rubric. In addition to being a long time supporter of Arbitrum, they provided detailed justifications for their KPIs, milestones, and overall execution strategy. We appreciated the sub-focus on Arbitrum Nova within their execution strategy and believe Hop plays an important role in driving further adoption and discovery for this chain. Overall, due to the robust nature of Hop’s application, their past success and impact to driving users to transact on Arbitrum native chains we will be supporting this grant proposal.",

They provided detailed explanations of their goals, KPIs, and milestones. Their requested grant size is rather large, however, given their ability to use previous grants effectively and increase TVL on Avalanche reduces some of the concerns. We also like how composable the project is which will lead to a direct boost in metrics for other protocols.\nIn contrast, we would’ve liked to have seen more data around protocol usage, user information, retention etc. \nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\nVote AGAINST DeltaPrime's proposal.\n\nWell written proposal that scored well in the rubric (team, strategy, KPIs, milestones, composability) + painted a clear picture that they understand their users well and have a good amount of insight from prior incentive programs they've run (re: points system). The large requested grant size relative to their activity on Arbitrum, the set goals of ~6x-ing TVL within a quarter, and lack of clarity on retention (to support their claim of TVL not flowing out of Prime Accounts for instance re: stickiness) brings pause.\n\nSuggest they resubmit in a future grants window with a lower amount (ie. 500k ARB / $50M TVL) after showing more PMF within Arbitrum and integration of other protocols.\n\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nDeltaprime presented a very thorough application. Their organic metrics were quite impressive and the had strong justifications behind their grant ask. We appreciate their ability to incorporate learnings from past incentives and implement desired changes into this program. Overall, we felt the application was heavily tailored to enabling growth on Arbitrum and we will be supporting this proposal.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nBased on the detailed information provided, the proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to leverage the DeltaPrime protocol to encourage growth within the Arbitrum ecosystem. The protocol has already demonstrated success on Avalanche and Arbitrum, with a track record of high TVL and user engagement. The proposed grant will further incentivize liquidity provision and borrowing activities, driving TVL growth and deepening liquidity across partner protocols. The use of milestones, speed bonuses, and retention incentives ensures user engagement and stickiness, while the multi-chain integration through the LiFi bridge enhances accessibility and attracts capital from other networks. With a robust security infrastructure, clear objectives, and well-defined KPIs, the proposal exhibits a strategic approach to achieving its goals and contributing significantly to the development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. We would approve this proposal.",

The reward for the incentives was not compelling in that example, however. Also, funding support for as-yet-to-be-determined integration partners is hard to sign off on, since as reviewers, we need to know where the ARB funds will end up. Finally, Gyroscope has almost no presence on Arbitrum according to DeFi Llama, which makes a large grant request difficult to support.\n\n*404 DAO Feedback)*\nGyroscope presented a very thorough application. One that scored very well across most of the rubric. Specifically, they excelled in justifying their KPIs and objectives as it relates to expanding their E-CLPs and expanding their stablecoin integrations. The main concerns were centered around where the majority of their usage has been (Polygon and Optimism) and some lack of clarity around their milestones. Overall, we will be suppporting Gyroscope on the basis of expanding stablecoin innovation and adoption on Arbitrum for what we feel as a very reasonable grant ask.\n\n*GMX Feedback)*\nThe protocol may not have high numbers on the Arbitrum network currently, but they have demonstrated decent traction on other Layer 2 solutions. GYD stablecoin stands out by implementing a basket of assets for backing, along with automated risk diversification rules. Integration with Frax and Balancer enhances its composability with other ecosystem projects. The proposed $10 million TVL target appears reasonable given their grant ask. The team boasts a solid background, with one founder having published work on Google Scholar. Their effective use of incentives in the past, particularly with Optimism, bodes well for their ability to drive adoption. Leveraging their points system to attract more users seems like a sound strategy, although safeguards against Sybil attacks should be clarified. Overall, Gryoscope aims to introduce a decentralized stablecoin backed by various assets to the Arbitrum ecosystem. With clear KPIs and milestones, they aim to utilize the $100k grant to incentivize and bootstrap their stablecoin for adoption. If they can achieve a $10 million liquidity target, they believe they can kickstart adoption. While Arbitrum lacks decentralized stable value options, Gryoscope has the potential to fill that gap if they can gain traction. The proposal is well-written and outlines their objectives very well.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nGyroscope’s application was very good, they provided very thorough details and justifications of their KPIs, milestones, goals, and objectives. They provided a clear vision of how they impact the DeFi landscape and how they will benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nTheir product is unique and they bring some interesting infrastructure to Arbitrum. Their demonstrated ability to successfully work with previous incentives is a plus. Their requested grant size is sufficiently justified and they have a solid execution strategy, however, we would’ve liked to have seen some more variety in the pool selection. Lastly, their project is highly composable and the product has demonstrated its ability to capture a significant amount of 1inch flow and transactions.\nWe will be supporting this application.",
