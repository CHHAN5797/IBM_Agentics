        "body": "**Title:** Aave Treasury Proposal: Onboard with Centrifuge Prime to invest in RWA\n\n**Author:** @Khan \n\n**Date:** Sep 12, 2023\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal brings on Centrifuge as a service provider to the Aave DAO to setup a legal structure to support RWA investments, develop RWA specific management and governance processes, and allocate $1M of the Aave Treasury’s stablecoin holdings to a liquid US T-Bill fund on Centrifuge, as a proof of concept investment.\n\nThis is a first step towards a long term effort for Aave to develop and launch an RWA Facilitator that will back GHO with Real World Assets. With this proposal Aave can earn yield on idle stablecoins, establish long-term RWA infrastructure for the protocol, and allow the Aave DAO to begin building internal familiarity and expertise in the RWA industry.\n\nThe proposal minimizes upfront cost and completely recoups the initial investment within 6-12mo and starts earning yield for Aave within the first 3mo. It locks up no long term capital and leaves the DAO in full control over the treasury allocation.\n\nThe main results of this proposal:\n1. Aave will onboard to Centrifuge Prime to establish the legal and technical infrastructure for the Aave protocol to invest in RWAs.\n1. Through Prime, the Aave Treasury will allocate $1M of USDC to the Anemoy LTF, a short-duration US treasury bill pool on Centrifuge.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAave has long been a contributor and supporter of RWA initiatives. Since the first announcement of GHO, the Aave community has consistently expressed its interest in expanding into this area. Treasury Management at Aave has historically been focused on strategic crypto assets, ignoring the returns and liquidity available in offchain markets for various reasons.\n\nToday, with roughly 17% of the treasury in stablecoins (~13m USD), the Aave DAO is overlooking the 5% available interest in the risk-free rate of overnight financing of US treasury assets. This can offer $250,000 of recurring revenue a year at just 5m USD of investment. These markets can immediately become some of the highest earning revenue streams for the DAO.\n\nBeyond just economics, this proposal would allow the Aave DAO to establish and begin developing the internal RWA expertise necessary to engage with these markets. Centrifuge Prime is purpose-built for DeFi native organizations, offering the critical services and infrastructure necessary to onboard a diverse portfolio of RWA through a single interface.\n\nCentrifuge has a long track record of working with DAOs to bring RWA on as collateral, and pioneered the first Aave deployment into RWA with the joint development of the RWA Market. Onboarding Aave to Centrifuge Prime for liquid investment strategies is an optimal approach for scaling RWA with the Aave community. It will develop the legal and technical infrastructure necessary to interface with RWAs safely and efficiently, while allowing the Aave community to get comfortable and familiar with the processes and thinking around RWA. This will put Aave in a significantly improved position to be able to leverage RWA collateral for GHO in the long term, either to improve liquidity or develop additional revenue streams.\n\n### **Specification**\n\n#### **Setting up the Aave DAO Legal Conduit**\nThis proposal instructs Centrifuge to initiate the setup of a legal structure for the benefit of the Aave DAO that will be ratified and deployed by a subsequent Aave token holder vote.\n\nThe process for establishing the legal framework is as follows: The Centrifuge contributor team will retain external legal counsel in the Cayman Islands to represent the Aave DAOs interests. The legal structure itself will be established per the previously discussed legal framework developed by Centrifuge. The defining documents and legal agreement team will be created to incorporate specific processes around the DAOs interaction with the foundation company. The results of this work will be presented to the Aave DAO, an analysis from the external counsel will be provided, and the community will have time to process, provide feedback, and otherwise request changes in the legal structure. The structure will only be implemented and executed with DAO approval, likely via Snapshot or other requisite process as requested by the community.\n\nThe legal structure will be integrated with DAO governance through a process defined in the legal documents, is capable of investing and holding assets on behalf of the DAO, and ultimately allow the Aave DAO full legal recourse to their investments. The legal counsel, while required under local Cayman law, is retained for the purposes of having an independent legal party to protect Aave’s interest.\n\nThe structure defines the actions the foundation can take, such as initiating investments or redemptions. Any action can be made only with approval from the DAO and providing a DAO approved “resolution” to the Foundation entity described above instructing the Foundation to act in accordance with the resolution. The specific details of this process will be developed alongside the Aave community.\n\nThis framework is based on our extensive experience in MakerDAO setting up similar structures 1. There, the same structure is used to support a >$1.2B debt ceiling, with >600m+ actively deployed.\n\nMore information on the fund, the legal framework, and the processes described here can be found in the [on going FAQ discussion here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n\n#### **Initial pilot investment in Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund**\n\nOnce the legal structure has been defined and implemented, a specific DAO resolution will be presented to the DAO that instructs the Foundation to perform a 1M investment into the Anemoy LTF and transfers 1M USDC from the DAOs treasury into the Anemoy pool onchain.\nCentrifuge will work with Aave to do an initial test investment and then a partial redemption to test out the complete rails.\n\n#### **Scaling beyond the first transaction**\n\nIt is best for Aave to deploy into RWAs slowly. This proposal creates an initial deployment into the Anemoy Liquid Treasury Fund of $1M (pending DAO approval at the time investment). It is up to the community to initiate further investments, but we recommend keeping RWA allocations at a fixed cap of the overall Aave balance sheet until the community is more comfortable.\n\nFrom there on, further investment and redemption actions are in full control of the Aave DAO. The process can easily be integrated to support portfolio and allocation decisions made through a more formal treasury management process, either manually or programmatically. Centrifuge is committed to supporting these efforts for the duration of this proposal’s stream.\n\nOutside of US treasuries, the Centrifuge Prime setup would also allow the Aave DAO to allocate into the following asset classes in the future:\n\n| Bucket| Description | Target Return | Liquidity\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Liquid | Lowest risk while maintaining US Treasuries, MMF, AA+ rated short term bonds| 5-6% | Daily\n| Preservation | Investments in senior secured loans such as real estate, corporate bonds etc. | 6-8% | 3-6 months\n| Acceleration | Trade finance, non-bank originators, emerging markets | 8-20% | 3-24mo |\n\n#### **Summary Process**\nIn summary, the following process will be executed through this proposal:\n1. Acquire Caymans Legal Counsel\n1. Conduct initial legal research and analysis alongside counsel, share to forum\n1. Post proposed legal documents and legal arrangement to forum, host community call, gather and implement community feedback. Arrangement will include explicit processes for management of the foundation company (i.e. investments and redemptions).\n1. DAO approval of legal implementation\n1. Foundation company onboards to Anemoy LTF\n1. DAO proposal request for 1m of USDC investment into Anemoy LTF\n\n\n**Estimated Timeline & Project Phases**\n\n\n| Activity | Description | Est. Time |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Legal setup | Creation of Foundation Company, passing of DAO resolutions to start deployment into RWAs | 1-2 months\n| Initial Deployment | DAO instructs Foundation to deploy $1M into a US Treasuries Fund and transfers $1M in USDC Stablecoins into the Anemoy LTF | 2-3mo\n| Scaling up / Ongoing Operation | DAO can vote on increase allocation to Prime and direct investments towards a variety of liquid lower yielding and more longer term investments at any time | After 3mo\n\n#### **Fees**\nWhile there are some legal setup costs that have to be covered by the DAO upfront we limit these as much as possible.\n\nEven at a conservative deployment of just $2M and a portfolio return equal to current US Treasury yields Aave should break-even within the first 6mo and start generating revenue for the DAO thereafter.\n\nThe legal work will be useful far beyond this initial proposal and can be the basis on which Aave onboards RWAs into GHO.\n\n**Fees**\n| Fee | Amount | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Legal Setup | up to 50,000 USDC | To be paid immediately into a Safe controlled by Centrifuge to pay for lawyers and Cayman service providers to set up a Cayman foundation company to the benefit of the Aave DAO, any unused budget will be returned to the Aave treasury.\n|Portfolio Fee | 0.35% p.a. on assets in Prime up to $50M, 0.2% $50-100M, 0.1% >$100M | Paid on an ongoing basis to Centrifuge for maintaining the portfolio\n|Aave Reward | 500 stkAave streamed over 2 years into the Centrifuge treasury, starting with the first 1M UDSC Deployment into Centrifuge Prime |To cover costs of resource and facilitation time for the development of the infrastructure and processes. Centrifuge DAO intends for this to create better alignment with strong skin in the game incentives for success.\n\n### **Summary of changes & discussion with the community since the Temp Check**\n* In discussion:\n    * Provided more details on the legal framework\n    * Provided more details on the Anemoy LTF\n    * Hosted individual and group calls with active delegates and voting participants to answer questions and provide further context\n    * Hosted a public Twitter Space\n* In this ARFC:\n    * Modified the proposal to focus primarily on an initial 1m RWA investment, with further investments explicitly out of scope\n    * Specified Aave Reward to be paid out only upon deployment of the initial investment\n    * Further explanation of legal constructs\n    * Further explanation on use of funds\n    * Defined a more detailed and explicit process for the establishment of the legal framework\n    * Defined a more detailed and explicit process for the initial 1m investment\n    * Breakout of proposal delivery steps and phase\n### **Additional Resources**\n* [Temp Check Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-treasury-proposal-for-rwa-allocation/14381)\n* [Further Discussion and Q&A](https://governance.aave.com/t/centrifuge-rwa-proposal-discussion-and-q-a/14681)\n* [Centrifuge Prime Announcement](https://medium.com/centrifuge/introducing-centrifuge-prime-real-yields-real-defi-b97a0e767f18)\n* [A Discussion on a GHO Real World Asset Facilitator](https://governance.aave.com/t/a-discussion-on-a-gho-real-world-asset-facilitator/11908/5)\n### **Disclaimer:**\nThis proposal is written by a member of the k/factory team, a core contributor to the Centrifuge protocol.\n### **Next Steps:**\nUpon approval, Centrifuge will work with the DAO to implement and execute the AIP.\n### **Copyright:**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4.

Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.

        "body": "## Rationale: \nEND_Bridge with the support of Centrifuge is proposing to add a Real World Assets (\"RWA\") permissioned market on Aave. \n\n## References: \nFollowing on from the ARC Proposal and discussions in the forum (link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-centrifuge-permissioned-rwa-market-proposal/4620))\n\n## Overview:\nOur goal is to launch the first (permissioned) market for Real World Assets (RWA) on the Aave protocol. This will allow Aave depositors to earn yield against stable, uncorrelated real world collateral while Centrifuge asset originators can borrow money from Aave, automatically balance capital needs and provide an alternative collateral to volatile crypto assets. Currently, [pools](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/) on the Tinlake protocol range from real estate, to supply chain financings, to music streaming invoices. \n\nThe permissioned RWA market will be operated and managed by END_Bridge via an independent and bankruptcy remote limited liability company. Independent means that END_Bridge is not owned, not operated by, and not managed by Centrifuge or one of the existing Issuers of RWA pools on Tinlake. \n\nCentrifuge is the infrastructure provider that enables asset originators to create an on-chain asset fund via Tinlake to finance loans. The asset originators provide the collateral assets to the permissioned RWA market by adding their DROP token to the pool in exchange for DAI. \n\n\n## Motivation\nRWA bear monumental potential for DeFi in regards to volume, adoption and risk diversification. Pioneering lending in DeFi, Aave could be the game changer for millions of businesses by providing instant, bankless liquidity. When bridging the regulated world of Tradfi to trustless DeFi you encounter challenges that only few in DeFi have taken on so far. Centrifuge is planning to make use of the new [permissioned pool](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/tree/feat/permissioned-market) feature on Aave which is designed to be compliant with AML regulations and US securities guidelines. The pool itself will be public on Ethereum but only accessible to those that undergo KYC verification. \n\nEach Tinlake pool has two tokens: [DROP and TIN](https://developer.centrifuge.io/learn/understanding-tinlake/#drop--tin-the-two-tranches). DROP is the senior tranche token, protected by the TIN token, which takes first losses. We want to use these DROP tokens as collateral, for borrowing DAI. Please note that there is one DROP token per Tinlake pool (e.g. NewSilver: real estate backed loans, NS2-DROP; ConsolFreight: trade finance txs, CF4-DROP). Currently the majority of [Tinlake](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io/) pools are denominated in Dai, meaning liquidity providers investing in a pool deposit Dai and receive interest bearing DROP tokens in return. On the permissioned RWA Market on Aave investors will be able to provide liquidity for a blended portfolio of DROP tokens. The design of the Tinlake infrastructure is focused on composability and allows for different types of investors to invest in a single pool. Some of our partners we work with are already onboarded to MakerDAO's MCD. This means individual pools have a corresponding vault on Maker and mint new DAI against their DROP collateral token. With the launch of the Centrifuge market on Aave our asset originators will gain additional liquidity sources and will be able to move their collateral freely between platforms following the best conditions instead of being siloed. To make beginnings easier for our asset originators they will only accept DAI and branch out to other stable coins long term.\n\nPlease find all **Specifications** on the [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-centrifuge-permissioned-rwa-market-proposal/4620)\n\n\n#### Risk Considerations\n\nWhereas it is a quite common occurrence that highly volatile crypto assets can quickly decrease in value and borrowers get liquidated from one hour to the next, RWA are different. Tinlake pools securitize balanced portfolios of real world assets, making the DROP tokens very stable assets. \n\nTinlake's RWA have a maturity date that indicates when a loan needs to be repaid (maturity ranges from 60-90 days for invoices, to 12-24 months for mortgages). If an asset has not been paid back upon maturity an asset originator usually starts a collection process to recoup funds. The worst case scenario is the default of an asset. Asset originators factor in expected defaults into their interest rate calculation and asset specific advance rates (E.g. it is common practice to finance only 80-90% of the face value of an invoice).\n\nBesides accounting for expected default via interest rates, all Tinlake pools have downside protection through the (Junior) TIN tranche. If for instance a single invoice of a balanced invoice portfolio defaults, TIN investors take first loss without impacting the DROP investors. Only if defaults exceed the pool specific TIN ratio the price of the DROP token is compromised. If this happens the pool is frozen which means that the asset originator cannot originate more loans until funds are recouped to pay out DROP investors (see an overview of our revolving pool mechanics [here](https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/community-call-october-15th-revolving-pools-and-tinlake-v3/291)).\n\n\n#### Asset parameters\nAll Tinlake pools have existing risk parameters, most importantly the DROP APR. This is the interest rate that senior (DROP) investors receive on their capital (excluding any cash drag). This parameter reflects the risk of the underlying asset and the senior tranche investment. We propose to use the DROP APR as one of the main drivers to determine the Aave risk parameters while taking maturity, the asset class, the size of the pool and the diversification within the pool into consideration. \n\nIn the table below we are proposing the following Aave risk parameters for our current live pools:  \n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/centrifuge-hackmd/upload_826d1b9b2c166c1ff6f6b4185e8300b1.png)\n\n\nWe are exploring whether we can use some of the upcoming new features coming in the Aave V2.5 protocol, like the Exposure Ceiling and Borrow/Supply Caps, to ensure proper diversification and risk management in the market.\n\nEvery new pool that will be added to the permissioned pool will go through Aave governance and put up for vote. \n\nAs for DAI, the currency which investors can use to participate in the market, we plan to only support variable rates in this market. Therefore, we propose the following Borrow Interest Rate for variable borrowing DAI:\n\n| |DAI Borrow Interest Rate|\n|-----|--------|\n|U_optimal|90.00%|\n|Base |1.00% | \n|Slope 1 |3.50% |\n|Slope 2 |90% |\n\nThese are similar to the DAI parameters in the Aave V2 market, with a few exceptions. The optimal utilization rate was set to 90.00% to encourage high utilization of the market, to maximize capital efficiency and investor returns. The slope is slightly lower before the optimal utilization rate, to even out interest rates. Above the optimal utilization rate, the slope is even higher than in the Aave V2 market for DAI, as the optimal utilization rate is higher and thus this will lead to more incentive for repayments when liquidity runs out. The associated interest rate curve has been visualized below.\n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/centrifuge-hackmd/upload_d78b27e2a985d9ded1f6345cc9bcc80c.png)\n\n\n**Technical Specifications**\n\nThe Centrifuge market will be a new deployment of the Aave V2 protocol, using the permissioned market implementation. We have been working closely with Aave developers and are close to deploying a test version of this market to Kovan. This market differs in a few ways from the existing markets. For regulatory compliance, in order to provide liquidity for the Centrifuge market, investors will need to:\n\n1. Pass KYC/AML checks.\n2. Sign a Subscription Agreement for the Aave Centrifuge market.\n\n\n***Price feed***\nEach DROP token is linked to a Tinlake pool, which is a set of contracts. There is no secondary market for DROP tokens. The price of the token is based on a NAV (Net Asset Value) calculation, which updates each second. The DROP token price can be calculated from the [Assessor contract](https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake/blob/develop/src/lender/assessor.sol#L135).\n\nThe Aave V2 protocol uses a Chainlink Aggregator by default as a price feed, and can use a fallback oracle if that doesn't exist. For DAI, we want to use the same oracle setup as DAI on the Aave V2 market. For our DROP tokens, we want to implement a fallback oracle contract, which retrieves the DROP token price from our Assessor contract.\n\n***Liquidations***\nLiquidations can be done by investors who have passed KYC and have signed the Subscription Agreement for specific Tinlake pools. These investors can participate in liquidations to receive DROP at a discount over investing directly into the pool. These DROP tokens can be used to place redemption requests on a specific Tinlake pool.\n\nEach DROP [token](https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake/blob/develop/src/lender/token/restricted.sol) is already restricted by a [memberlist contract](https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake/blob/develop/src/lender/token/memberlist.sol). To avoid having to modify the Aave V2 core contracts, we will use a new proxy contract. This contract will be the only address with the liquidator role in the Centrifuge market.",

TokenLogic shall focus on Aave DAO finances and support GHO adoption.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nMembers of the TokenLogic team have been contributing to Aave Protocol since mid 2020. More recently, the team has been expanding in preparation to better support our three focus areas:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* Safety Module modelling\n* GHO Adoption\n\nTokenLogic is a developer focused team with a proven track recorded dating back to March 2023 when the delegation platform was annouced. During this time we have delivered the following:\n\n* 5 AIPs, 6 payloads, several GHO related BIPs\n* [GHO liquidity pools analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n* Coordinated [7.7%](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071) veBAL support for GHO's launch\n* Stoodup an analytics platform \n* Launch of [GHO Analytics frontend](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n\nThe team is growing and we onboarded an accounting team to start developing a Aave Financial Reporting (genesis to date) frontend, launch date mid/late Q4 2023.\n\n# Current & Future Areas of Focus\n\n The below provides a high level overview of our **key focus** areas:\n\n* **Treasury Management**\n    * Improving the risk adjusted return of DAO's assets\n        * Aave v2 to v3 migrations\n        * Swap long tail assets to ETH / stable coins\n    * Improving capital efficiency\n        * Convert wMATIC to MaticX & stMATIC\n    * Managing strategic assets\n        * Upgrades to Strategic Asset Manager v1 functionality as required\n    * Modelling asset purchase / bribe\n        * Participate in Quest/Bribe v acquiring asset\n    * Engage, collaborate and support community lead initiatives\n        * Example: How best to optimise CRV holding\n    * Oversee Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) deployment\n        * If DAO elects to provide POL, ensure Boost is directed to holding to optimise returns and maintain the strategy through claiming and swapping/locking rewards.\n    * Design and create a contract for managing DAO's POL\n        * Perform swaps, claim incentives, transfer assets etc...\n    * Claim Aave Protocol revenue fees at the end of each month\n        * This bot is currently operated by Llama\n\n* **GHO Liquidity / Incentives Management**\n    * Create Liquidity Management Committee / Budget\n        * Provide modelling to support Committee decision making\n    * Liquidity Incentive Optimisation Analysis (Strategic Assets)\n        * Target pool sizes & APRs \n    * Explore synergies with Safety Module diversification\n        * Potential to include GHO liquidity pools\n        * We will lead this effort after Llama's contract finishes\n* **Financial Reporting**\n    * Runway forecast\n        * Specifically tracking asset balance and drawdown rates to show when other assets require being swapped to fund the DAO\n    * Budget and resource allocation\n        * Work with ACI and others to develop a DAO budget\n    * Transparent accurate, third party reviewed, accessible financial statments\n        * Launch a financial statment frontend mid/late Q4 2023\n        * Cover Ethereum, Polygon (PoS), Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche initially and expand over time.\n        * Quarterly financial publications \n    * Revenue per Reserve v time charts\n        * Daily or Hourly data showing revenue being generated per Reserve on each Aave v2 and v3 iteration\n        * Users will be able to select an asset and see total revenue noiminated in the underlying or select an instance of Aave and a specific asset.\n        * Data will be displayed graphically with some ability to interact with the charts\n* **Supporting GHO Adoption**\n    * Collaborate with other teams to support GHO adoption\n        * Promote utility and velocity\n    * Continual development of GHO Analytics frontend\n    * Promote adoption through DeFi integrations\n        * Examples include working with teams to build real yield strategies, structured products and list GHO as collateral\n* **Safety Module Improvements**\n    * Model the SM performance during shortfall events\n        * Create a frontend that show historical performance for swapping certain amounts of each asset instantly (not dutch auction) via an aggregator\n    * Model / forecast emission budget\n        * AAVE emissions are finite, GHO is better\n        * Capital efficiency could be improved through adoption of quests and/or acquiring assets that control the emission schedule of another protocol\n    * Advocate for diversification and reducing the reward budget\n        * Introduction of stable coins, ETH and other assets to reduce reliance on AAVE during shortfall events\n    * Collaborate with others to refine to enhance the SM's effectiveness at providing a backstop for Aave Protocol\n        * BGD to implement on-chain upgrades\n        * Model liquidity pool assets to be added to SM\n        * Work with ACI, BGD, Llama and others to determine a target coverage, implementation of proposals and refine the asset blend\n\nEach of the areas detailed above is interwoven and has a material affect on the DAO's financial status. TokenLogic is committed to working with other DAO contributors collaboratively and constructively to better the Aave Protocol. \n\nTo support the initiatives aboves, we have created an analytics platform. The GHO dashboard is our first analytics initiative. Beyond GHO, we plan on using the analytics platform to provide the DAO with near live revenue data stream for each asset reserve on supported networks. We seek to always incorporate community feedback and build out any requests from the community.\n\nOur team is very well connected across defi and we intend to support Aave and GHO where ever we can. To this end, we are already working with several teams looking to integrate GHO and have been working with @0xbilll at AGD with targeted spending initiatives.\n\nTo ensure continuation of active work scopes, TokenLogic will continue to manage the migration of users on Polygon v2 to v3. This includes either fortnightly or monthly parameter adjustments. We encourage another service provider to pick up the Avalanche v2 migration. However, if required, we are happy to support provided it doesn't impact our key focus ares which we will be measure against.\n\n# Prior Work\n\nThis section, we will focus on what TokenLogic has delivered to Aave DAO:\n\n* [TokenLogic Delegate Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n* Asset Listings\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX to Aave V3 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-to-aave-v3-ethereum/13051)\n    * [[AIP] Add FRAX Ethereum Aave v3](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/260/)\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX Arbitrum Aave v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-arbitrum-aave-v3/13222)\n    * [[AIP] Add ARB to Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/273/)\n* GHO Liquidity\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] GHO Liquidity Pools](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655)\n    * [[ARFC] GHO Liquidity Pools: Primary Pools Initial Strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n    * Coordinated veBAL and vlAURA support for the launch of GHO\n* GHO Analytics Dashboard\n    * https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/\n* GHO Yield Strategy\n    * Supported **Sommelier** with development of real yield strategies that manage GHO liquidity across several DEXs.

With several developers, strategists and accountants apart the team, we are mostly manned up and ready to take on a more involved service provider scope. \n\n# Budget\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of 350,000 USD for an initial 6 month period to support our initiatives.\n\nThis budget will contribute to covering operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure plus the resources required to deliver our work.\n\nThe payment terms are as shown below:\n\nUpfront Transfer: ~~210,000~~ 0 GHO\nStream: ~~140,000~~ 350,000 GHO\n\nThis is a ~~60/40~~ 0/100 split of upfront/streamed.\n\nAddress: `eth:0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nSimilar to ACI, TokenLogic is to be included in the [Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gas-rebate-for-recognized-delegates/13290) program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts and deployment costs.\n\nTokenLogic commits to not receiving any funds from other entities for creating proposals and publishing AIPs on Aave Protocol.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nThe below provides an overview of how the DAO can assess TokenLogic's performance:\n\n* Migrate Aave DAO funds from v2 to v3\n* Create Liquidity Committee with funding\n* Optimise GHO liquidity incentives \n* Strategic Assets are being actively used\n* Runway funding sustained (>6 months of the correct assets)\n* Convert Treasury assets to LSTs\n* Launch financial statement frontend\n* Continual flow of new GHO Dashboard features\n\nAs DAOs are dynamic, when more urgent priorities emerge TokenLogic will support and proactively work with other service providers to act in Aave's best interest. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf the [TEMP CHECK] is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal [ARFC] submission to governance.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining transparency throughout the process and providing regular updates the community on our progress.\n\nWe thank everyone for considering our proposal and appreciate your support. We look forward to working together and driving success to the Aave Protocol.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].\n\nAave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.\n\nOption 1) Locking veBAL.\nOption 2) Staking auraBAL.\n\nOption 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).\n\nA Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.\n\nAave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:\n\n* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].\n* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].\n* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].\n\nThis proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.\n\n## Option 1) Locking veBAL\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nIn Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.\n\n### What’s veBAL ?\n\nveBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc\n\n* **Gauge-weight Power**\nVoting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.\n\n* **Governance Power**\nVoting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.\n\n* **veBoost**\nLocking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.\n\n* **Protocol Fees**\n75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].\n\n### veBAL Position Overview\n\nBy maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].\n\nWith 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).\n\nBAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.\n\nAave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies\n* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n\nThe boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.\n\nThere remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].\n\n### veBAL yield overview\n\nThe veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:\n\n* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)\n* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)\n* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold\n\nIn the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week\n\nveBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92\n\n* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.\n\nIt’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.\n\n## Option 2) Staking auraBAL\n\nOption 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.\n\nAfter the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].\n\nDepositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.\n\nThe yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.\n\n* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.\n* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).\n* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.\n\nGrowing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.\n\nWith 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.\n\nBy staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].\n\nOption 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.\n\n## Comments\n\nTo help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.\n\nThere are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nTo summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|\n|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|\n|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|\n\nThe amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at\n\nLlama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:\n\n1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH\n2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap\n3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.\n![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)\nThe BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL\n4. Approve BAL on Cowswap\n5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH\n\n![|312x312](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NyamWu2oOW0-UTQrXfcgD2kR4Z6J64pqWmD2kFrcZd_8Ay-MrXsGlGtIXnKSbhcHjzvfFFMtGTc_Hlpuel5Qp0j8GevSPNkqB9AkPN5LZhQLmAW-c8jYmESZPCkEI4QkSc8QaOhdFarIytRV6uq2QNA)\n\nAave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.\n\nAt the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70\n$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56\n\nIn performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).\n\nThe number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.\n\n\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.\n\nThose considerations are:\n\n* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade\n* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]\n* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmVqWgpRmoEvvhvXZFepmAgYU5ZK9XpSs39MExEUpiJZw3\n[3] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484/19\n[5] https://dune.com/queries/782195/1395498\n[6] https://app.warden.vote/dashboard/\n[7] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ac1109d58b02b5b74f10d92fb816a9cdc4b198fd455cc2bb2fdbb52ae84f9e\n[8] https://etherscan.io/token/0x616e8BfA43F920657B3497DBf40D6b1A02D4608d?a=0x5e5ea2048475854a5702f5b8468a51ba1296efcc\n[9] https://dev.balancer.fi/resources/deploy-pools-from-factory/creation/aavelinearpool\n[10] https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n[11] https://app.aura.finance/#/lock\n[12] https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249\n[13] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [13].",
