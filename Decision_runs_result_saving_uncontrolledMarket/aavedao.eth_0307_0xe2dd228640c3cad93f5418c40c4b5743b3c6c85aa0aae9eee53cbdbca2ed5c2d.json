        "body": "### Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes to make adjustments to stablecoin interest rate models across Aave v2 and v3 markets. Specifically, this ARFC proposes to increase the slope 1 parameter for stablecoins to implement a 5% optimal borrow rate.\n\nForum discussion thread linked [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096).\n\n### Motivation\n\nOver the past several months, equilibrium stablecoin borrowing costs across the broader defi space have trended upwards, and may now be higher than the governance defined “optimal borrow rate” set within Aave’s stablecoin interest rate models. For example, Maker borrow and supply (DSR) rates have been mostly over 5% since mid August. Rates in tradfi have also risen significantly, with short term treasury bills yielding around 5.5% and even long term treasury rates rising to nearly 5% across various maturities.\n\nThis mismatch between Aave’s rate models and the broader market leads to a range of potential inefficiencies, including deadweight loss from the cost of liquidity being artificially constrained away from equilibrium value, and negative UX impact due to greater rate volatility when utilization is above the optimal ratio.\n\nFirst, we present data backing up the assertion that Aave’s current stablecoin rate models are not finding efficient market equilibriums. Then, we discuss the negative impacts of this including deadweight loss and UX impacts. Finally, we present a plan of adjustment that we estimate will address the market inefficiencies and lead to improved market utility across borrowers, suppliers, and the community of AAVE token holders.\n\n#### UX Impacts\n\nWe gathered block by block interest rate data for the largest stablecoin markets across v2 and v3 (USDC, USDT, and DAI) from 1 August to 7 October, block numbers 17816255 to 18300344. \n\nIn the middle of this period (28 August), Aave governance executed proposal 306, which added sDAI as collateral on v3 while increasing the slope1 parameter for DAI to 5% on both v2 and v3. This offers useful data to A/B test the premise of whether increasing the borrow rate at optimal utilization can help improve market functioning.\n\nReviewing data for the Aave v3 DAI market, we can see that the increase in slope1 was strikingly effective at reducing borrow rate volatility, with the percent of time utilization was above optimal point falling from 62% to below 1%. There were some confounding factors, such as market turbulence over CRV leveraged positions at the beginning of August, and Maker’s elevated 8% DSR rate effective from 4 August to 18 August. But we can see heightened rate volatility from utilization exceeding the optimal ratio persists even excluding these periods.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihm2rujbkmv7o6lanrmlzqey5op32l56s4ac6z5hsdhkdmctkdftu)\nSource: [Stablecoins ARFC Market Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EV1NfAlYEqpOkbusduCSC5srFHEAH8ijmr8gn7nAa-E/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihueexjztvdyxf2gfegwrfclnr23dwuhrxcrgh3axgalsfc27ulcm)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (DAI v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/DAI/)\n\nComparing this with historical rates data for Ethereum v3 USDC and USDT markets (shown below), we can see a significant reduction in borrow rate volatility from the increase in the slope1 parameter. Note that the USDC market seems to exhibit higher volatility because it has a slope1 parameter of 3.5%, vs 4% for the USDT market.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihwzbrm4e4vn7x7b62bkbsn6hmkzjtwdkv5i6mxos4rxvs2v6sfh4)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (USDC v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/USDC/)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidveiwtydsstbqa7yiy7aevrepjfdauqkgfenzeajehxjfmwc32d4)\nSource: [Block Analitica Aave Dashboard (USDT v3)](https://aave.blockanalitica.com/v3/ethereum/markets/USDT/)\n\nWe can expect reduced rate volatility to drive an increase in borrower participation. Paradoxically, raising the slope1 parameter for the DAI markets also seems to have been associated with a reduction in average (geometric mean) borrowing rates; for example, the average v3 DAI borrow cost from 1 August to 28 August (when proposal 306 was executed) was 6.49%, while the average rate from 28 August to 7 October was 4.56%.\n\nLooking at the USDC v3 market over the same 28 August to 7 September period, we see the average (geometric mean) borrowing rates were 4.52%, so similar to DAI after the adjustment to interest rate models but with much higher volatility. This supports the notion that raising slope1 can bring greater rate stability without negatively impacting borrower welfare.\n\n#### Deadweight Loss\n\nDeadweight loss is an economic concept that describes the loss of total utility created by a market when prices are artificially constrained either above or below the optimal equilibrium where supply and demand are in balance.\n\nIt is commonly demonstrated with graphs of the supply and demand curve; any quantities exchanged below borrowers’ (consumers’) marginal willingness to pay represents consumer surplus, while quantities exchanged over suppliers’ (producers’) marginal willingness to produce represents producer surplus, and together these represent the markets overall utility.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxeijjhirs447bgwpqjltouti3kyjkilleuqob3tjq43j7apzmkm)\n    \nWhen prices are artificially constrained above or below the market equilibrium, this leads to a lower quantity of goods exchanged, which reduces the total area of consumer and producer surplus and creates an area on the graph showing reduced utility known as deadweight loss.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaybtbjwlkyvl2bcak57kpmvdf2ozuwoxvs5anc7pi27ol767mbqa)\n    \nWith borrowing rates at optimal utilization falling below broader market levels, this can have the unintentional effect of constraining price below equilibrium value, which reduces overall utility of the Aave stablecoin markets. This has a likelihood to constrain market size growth over the medium term as suppliers are insufficiently incentivized to deposit more capital, while borrowers have a very low amount of liquidity available at reasonable prices before pushing the utilization above the optimal point and potentially pushing rates far above the market equilibrium.\n\n### Proposed Adjustments\n\nWe propose an adjustment to the variable slope1 parameter for stablecoins across Aave v2 and v3 markets to better align optimal utilization rates with the broader market. While the proposal initially referred only to Ethereum markets, we see similar high rate conditions persisting across markets on other chains and risk service providers have indicated support for updating optimal rates across all active Aave deployments.\n\nThis will result in borrowing rates at optimal utilization still being equal or slightly below most other defi options (eg. Maker and Spark rates), while significantly increasing supply rates. Increasing the expected supply rates for stablecoins on Aave v3 Ethereum market may lead to a bit more downward price pressure on GHO, but this is not expected to be material considering that users can already borrow GHO with sDAI collateral (at 5% collateral yield, likely higher than the average for other stablecoin markets after this change) and Aave governance is also considering additional measures to support the GHO peg.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Ethereum v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n- Set sUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set GUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDP slope1 to 5%\n\n**Ethereum v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n\n**Avalanche v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Avalanche v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n\n**Polygon v2 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Polygon v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Optimism v3 Market:** \n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set sUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Arbitrum v3 Market:**\n\n- Set USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDC.e slope1 to 5%\n- Set USDT slope1 to 5%\n- Set DAI slope1 to 5%\n- Set LUSD slope1 to 5%\n- Set FRAX slope1 to 5%\n- Set MAI slope1 to 5%\n\n**Base v3 Market:** \n\n- Increase USDC slope1 to 5%\n\n**Metis v3 Market:** \n\n- Increase USDC slope1 to 5%\n- Increase USDT slope1 to 5%\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nBlock Analitica is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\nThis proposal is presented on an “as is” basis and without warranty of any kind.

        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to increase stablecoin Interest Rate parameters across all Aave deployments.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing the implementation of [AIP-375](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/375/) to increase stablecoin borrow rates across Aave V2 and V3 deployments, we continue to observe volatility in borrow rates across Aave deployments. As we [highlighted](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096/3) in the recent proposal, we recommend a more aggressive increase of the Slope1 parameter to stabilize borrows under the UOptimal point.\n\n### Previous IR Curve modification impact analysis\n\n**Stablecoins Total Supply and Borrow:** The data from the charts reflects an overall increase in both the supply and borrowing of stablecoins on the Ethereum V3 platform. From November 25th to December 12th we observed the following increases in supply and borrow across USDC, USDT, and DAI:\n \n![image](ipfs://Qma9SeLwfVs7v6gFVLdQsGR8pHWVkiK8xnNjncMLFmmKEe)\n    \nWe’ve observed an overall $49M increase (20.8%) in supply across USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum V3, and a $104M increase (45.4%) in borrows.\nThis general uptrend suggests that the AIP's changes were well received, with higher utilization for the assets following the parameter updates.\n\n![Frame 78017.png](ipfs://QmZrFJXLiYdXkHazHzhQU9ztciMZhbmZW91fosSsPbS2k3)\n\n \n![Frame 78018.png](ipfs://QmapwiVXKY9F8LAToEgAJMLTJUTD8qaHjM4jvHCtyCPfAF)\n    \n\n**Utilization Rate Analysis:** Our continuous monitoring of the utilization rates post AIP-375, setting Slope1 at 5%, shows sustained demand. When looking at the percentage of times in which utilization was above UOptimal, we can see that the AIP-375 increase didn’t stabilize the utilization at or below the UOptimal. This could also be due to changing market dynamics with the recent increase in crypto asset prices.\n\nDuring two distinct 16-day intervals, we observed the following:\n\n- **Pre-AIP-375 Period (11.09.23 - 11.25.23)**\n- **Post-AIP-375 Period (11.25.23 - 12.12.23)**\n\n**Percentage of Time of Utilization Above UOptimal:**\n\n| Asset | Before AIP-375 | After AIP-375 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USDC | 69.53% | 77.34% |\n| USDT | 63.02% | 33.09% |\n| DAI | 48.70% | 63.24% |\n\n \n![Frame 78019 (1).png](ipfs://QmeVmhQjvUfCyx8X1Dioriz5rmcMQNVP4xRr1bcGomF3Ye)\n    \nThe data demonstrates strong borrowing activity persisting after the interest rate curve adjustments, supporting a move towards higher interest rates. This pattern reflects a consistent, resilient demand among the top stablecoins on Ethereum V3.\n\n**Borrow Rate Analysis:** After executing the previous proposal, we continue to observe fluctuations in borrow rates, suggesting the previous increase did not achieve the anticipated stabilization. This situation suggests that further adjustments of the interest rate parameters are necessary to achieve more consistent and stable borrowing rates.\n\n \n![Frame 78020.png](ipfs://QmNRDSTSAK1TabFokii9ds53YVHf2kSYnFHiDQch2Ka5tA)\n    \n![403641469_370769045314386_6540288414402371375_n (1).png](ipfs://QmdnPzCUb37oWHbQPEShZrGnD3NxxTtWnRAZMpTZ63UHgR)\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Adjust Slope1 of stablecoins to 6%**\n\nThe analysis indicates a necessity for further refinement of stablecoin interest rates, to achieve a more predictable and stable borrowing rate with an equilibrium utilization under the UOptimal point. \nTherefore, we propose increasing Slope1 to 6% for stablecoins across all Aave deployments, in this iteration. Following this increase, we will continue monitoring the usage and equilibrium rate and make additional recommendations as necessary. \n\n# Specification\n\n| Market | Asset | Current Slope1 | Rec Slope1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | sUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | GUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDP | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | sUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC.e | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Base V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Metis V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Metis V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @scottincrypto\nDated: 2022-12-17 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend BAL interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (when deployed), Polygon v3 and Polygon v2 Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere is currently a high demand for borrowing BAL (interest rate = 28.18% on Polygon v3) across all Reserves. The BAL liquidity pools offer poor capital efficiency, with the utilization of the Reserve ([48.27%](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x9a71012b13ca4d3d0cdc72a177df3ef03b0e76a3&marketName=proto_polygon_v3) on Polygon v3) often near the Optimal point of 45%.\n\nBy changing the interest rate curve across all three active Liquidity Pools, this proposal is expected to improve capital efficiency by lowering interest rates on markets where borrowing is disabled and enticing capital to move to where borrowing demand generates an attractive yield. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and generate significant capital efficiency within the BAL Reserves.\n\nDue to the ongoing incentives offered by Aura Finance, any new deposits are expected to be borrowed. Users are able to borrow and deposit BAL into [Aura Finance’s staking contract](https://app.aura.finance/) to earn a yield of around 45% at the time of writing. This creates an arbitrage opportunity of 16.82% taking into account the liquidation risk, auraBAL peg and additional Smart Contract risk.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUsers are expected to continue borrowing BAL to earn yield whilst interest rates permit and, in doing so, will create ongoing borrowing demand for BAL. Changing the interest rate curve by amending the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will improve the capital efficiency of Reserves. However, with borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it is rational for profit driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield.\n\nThe three charts below show the most recent 5 month historical BAL interest rate across each BAL Reserve. The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 28.18% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14% which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pyLdQvS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6sNc6ku.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eAG1lOG.png)\n\nIn addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at 0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a BAL interest rate similar to the SNX interest rate curve which has a base 3%, slope 1 12% and slope 2 100%.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b3kks7y.png)\n\nUtilization of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 73.33% assuming users can borrow BAL and are willing to pay an interest rate of 13%, which is less than the current borrowing rate of 28.18%. With a borrowing cost of 14% at the Optimal point, depositing BAL into Aura Finance’s auraBAL staking contract or B-80BAL-20wETH / auraBAL gauge will remain lucrative for users. If the utilization exceeds the Uoptimal point, a follow up proposal will propose increasing the interest rate further.\n\nThe improved capital efficiency of the BAL Reserve is expected to lead to an increase in BAL liquidity on-chain. The more on-chain liquidity there is, the more expensive it is to manipulate an oracle feed. Based upon the @ChaosLabs Borrow Cap formula, Llama proposes increasing the Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 from  96,798.00 units to 256,140.00 units.\n\nWith respect to the Polygon v3 deployment, assuming the BAL Reserve remains at $979,230, the revenue generated at the Optimal point for the DAO will increase from $6.17k to $20.4k, or 230%. The Reserve utilization increases from 45% to 80%, which reduces the amount of unused BAL by 63.6%. This will provide a significant increase in capital efficiency.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the BAL Interest Rate on Ethereum v2, Polygon v2 and Polygon v3.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nThe below shows the proposed changes to the Borrow Cap on Polygon v3.\n\n|Polygon Parameter| Units |\n| --- | --- | \n| Supply Cap | 284,600 (no change)|\n| Borrow Cap | 256,140 |\n\nBorrow Cap is calculated: \n(Uoptimal + 0.1) x SupplyCap\n(0.8+0.1) x 284,600 = 256,140\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0\\(https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This phenomenon can be explained by the drop-off in ETH staking yield, as we can deduce through the relatively strong correlation between WETH borrow APY and stETH staking APY on Ethereum due to profitable looping strategies. Additionally, given Aave prices stETH:ETH 1:1 with the underlying exchange rate, minimal liquidation risk exists in potential wstETH market price movements.\n\n**Correlation Between stETH APY and WETH APY**\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidezrni5upml4xk4kzuchihyd4magrivgd5dvkpicynhrl6atenjy)\n    \n*Correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY.*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihrjropidawamiki4v4bchp6lgb4fwp2rhvodamveeec4vcqwpgoy)\n    \n*Cross-correlation between stETH APY and WETH borrow APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*\n\nComputing the cross-correlation between the three markets, we notice an approximately 1-week lag when this hits the maximum value, implying the speed at which the borrow rates are maximally reflected in the staking APY.\n\nThis is statistically significant, as we can see below, where 85%-90% of all WETH debt is backed by ETH LSTs on the respective chain.\n\n**Arbitrum**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia4qecvzmgfvjxdoicw3vl2hwd5fvddg72pckqd6dvcdhljvqowia)\n    \n\n**Optimism**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibvtx2mcru2gie5oaek3pqcj2bxohv5zxw4f4pv3jjgcliz7yicxe)\n    \n\n**Ethereum**\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihjoo5senhh2qa747ap4ly2sfhva2zby5ex3lvmeffumryilyfp3y)\n    \n### stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY\n\nInterestingly enough, one might think that as stETH yields decrease, looping strategies would become less profitable. However, upon analyzing the difference between the stETH APY and WETH borrow APY (stETH APY - WETH APY) alongside the stETH APY itself at a given time t, a negative correlation emerges, with the peak occurring at a 2-week lag. Essentially, this means that the rate of decrease in borrow APY over time outpaces that of the stETH APY. Thus, we can conclude that when stETH APYs are high, borrowers attempt to extract as much revenue as possible, leading to convergence at lower yields. On the contrary, when stETH APYs are low, borrowers and ETH borrow APYs tend to be less aggressive with looping, perhaps due to theoretical scaling in the interest rate requiring smaller growth to become unprofitable, leading to the effective yield scaling higher than instances when stETH APYs are high. This in turn leads to less efficient markets and larger spreads when ETH staking yields are low.\n\n**stETH APY Differential vs. WETH Borrow APY**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeie4ng55vhthsijbs6l676atj6rjpbatve7w2tufcl3mkccqukocqu)\n    \n*Time series of stETH APY - WETH APY. stETH APY plotted on secondary axis.*\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihq7kfchngvinlhhneqnuqu4aamzfasf3d5e6gxddnh4rh5zkxbj4)\n    \n*Cross-correlation between (stETH - WETH borrow APY) and stETH APY, plotting the correlation coefficient with respect to time lag.*\n\n**WETH Utilization Rates**\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihjpcivhoywbhley2ysf4zaaa7nqmkqtsx7f3rt33dvphemir6w4u)\n    \n*WETH Utilization rate time series.*\n\nBased on the observed trend, it's evident that Arbitrum and Optimism could benefit from a reduction in slope1 to enhance utilization rates and consequently increase revenues. While the decrease in base_rate on both chains did positively impact utilization, it remains suboptimal. Thus, we simply take the P95 of the stETH APY differential vs WETH borrow APY since the base_rate decrease, which returned 0.6%, to derive the decrease in slope1. Considering the Uoptimal rate is projected to be below the current stETH APY with a 0.6% variance, any prolonged convergence above Uoptimal could lead to interest rate volatility. In such a scenario, it would be prudent to revert slope1. However, given the current trend and staking APY, this adjustment would likely result in higher utilization rates and greater profits for the Aave DAO.\n\nAssuming convergence at today’s WETH interest rates:\n\n|  | Arbitrum | Optimism |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Old Utilization Rate | 68.69% | 65% |\n| New Utilization Rate | 76.5% | 72% |\n| Projected Revenue Increase | 13.62 ETH $38.5k year | 4 ETH $11.3k year |\n\nWe note that adjusting WETH slope1 on other non-Ethereum chains with this intuition is seen as irrelevant, as either the market itself portrays too small a sample size with minimal relative demand for ETH LSTs as collateral, there does not exist ETH LSTs on the chain or ETH LST supply caps have been at max capacity for months.\n\n###  Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset |Parameter | Currebt |Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | ---| ---|\n| Arbitrum | WETH |Slope1| 3.3% | 3% |\n| Optimism | WETH|Slope1|3.3% | 3% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust five (5) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus, across two (2) Aave V3 Optimism assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nChaos Labs’ Parameter Recommendation Platform runs hundreds of thousands of agent-based off-chain and on-chain simulations to examine how different Aave V3 risk parameters configurations would behave under adverse market conditions - and find the optimal values to maximize protocol borrow usage while minimizing losses from liquidations and bad debt. \n\n*Note: As a general guideline, we limit the proposed changes by +-3% for all parameters as a high/low bound for a given proposal. This ensures more controlled changes and allows us to analyze their effect on user behavior before recommending further amendments to the parameters if the optimal configuration is outside this range.*\n\nPlease find more information on the parameter recommendation methodology [here](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations/methodology).\n\nYou can also view the simulation results and breakdown for the different assets by clicking on them on this [page](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/recommendations).\n\nThe output of our simulations reveals an opportunity to increase LTVs and LTs for WBTC and DAI on V3 Optimism, resulting in improved capital efficiency of the system, with no effect on the projected VaR (95th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours) and EVaR (Extreme VaR, the 99th percentile of the protocol losses that will be accrued due to bad debt from under-collateralized accounts over 24 hours)\n\n**Simulating all changes jointly yields a projected borrow increase of ~$155,000, with no increase in VaR and Extreme VaR compared to simulations with the current parameters.**\n\n \n![Untitled (30) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreifsuvfdgldiuwht446nposyfqsxkt5xatmfoh2xlqpfohsu6ozdne)\n\n \n![Untitled (31) (1).png](ipfs://bafkreif7g5o5w7coateogkysbd6sclmcbxbxqggbdkidd24bisuvzoasgi)\n    \n    \n\n### Liquidity Analysis:\n\nThe TVL in Aave on Optimism (118.71M$) is concentrated primarily on three blue-chip, high-liquidity assets, which together account for ~75% of the supplied assets in $ values: USDC (34%), WETH (28%), and WBTC (14%). Based on our analysis, we recommend increasing the Loan-To-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT) for WBTC and DAI, as we have determined that there is adequate on-chain liquidity to support significant liquidations. Similarly, we recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty for WBTC, which is set conservatively at 10% to a lower level (8.5%) closer to that of USDC and Ethereum (5%).\n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nWe have not identified any outsized positions that are actively affecting our recommendations. However, we should call out that  ~40% of the on-chain supply of WBTC on Optimism is currently held on Aave, which calls for some caution. We have already proposed and implemented an [amendment to the supply cap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-chaos-labs-supply-and-borrow-cap-updates-aave-v3-2023-02-24/12048/4) to limit the concentration of liquidity on Aave.\n\nGiven the blue-chip nature of BTC/WBTC, we expect significant arbitrage buying pressure to offset any slippage that may be created by future liquidations of WBTC and, therefore, recommend reducing the Liquidation Penalty even with the current significant liquidity concentration on Aave. We expect a lower LP to drive liquidators to liquidate positions in smaller portions, pacing the process and allowing the market more time to react. \n\n### Recommendations\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Rec | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Threshold | 75% | 78% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Loan-to-Value | 70% | 73% | +3% |\n| WBTC | Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 8.5% | -1.5% |\n| DAI | Liquidation Threshold | 80% | 83% | +3% |\n| DAI | Loan-to-Value | 75% | 78% | +3% |",

    "summary": "This proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 interest rate parameter for stablecoins across all Aave deployments to either 8% (Conservative) or 10% (Aggressive) to better align borrowing rates with current market demand and utilization levels. The aggressive option is supported by robust vote dynamics and detailed analytics showing sustained high utilization above the current UOptimal threshold, as well as the need to stabilize borrowing rates under the UOptimal point. Historical similar proposals aimed to adjust risk parameters to better reflect market conditions, with mixed post-vote market impacts. Community forum sentiment is mixed but leans slightly negative, though the vote strongly favors the Aggressive option.",

This choice aims to maximize protocol stability and responsiveness to current market demand, reflecting a durable benefit for the DAO despite some community reservations.",
