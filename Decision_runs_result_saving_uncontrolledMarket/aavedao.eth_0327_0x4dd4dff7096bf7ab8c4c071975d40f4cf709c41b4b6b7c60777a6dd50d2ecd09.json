        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GSM Funding & RWA Strategy Preparations\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @Sisyphos & @efecarranza \ncreated: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nIn preparation for launching the GHO Stability Module (GSM) and the $1M RWA strategy with Centirfuge, this publication seeks to make available the necessary amount of USDC and USDT on Ethereum v3. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe GSM is in the late stages of audit and is expected to be available for deployment in the near future. The Centrifuge proposal is currently mid way through the review process. The current stable coin holdings on Ethereum are insufficient to support the GSM, RWA strategy and Service Provider (SP) commitments. Additional funds are needed on Ethereum to support the GSM. \n\nThe [largest GSM funding requested](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-stability-module-update/14442/10) consisted of the following:\n\n* 3.5M USDC\n* 3.5M USDT \n\nThe RWA Strategy is valued at [1M](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-treasury-rwa-allocation/14790) of USDC funding.\n\nThe expected aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT Reserve Holding, post Aave Funding Part B being implemented, is as shown below:\n\n* 2.93M aEthUSDC (0.72M current holding plus 2.21M Aave Funding Part B)\n* 0.71M aEthUSDT (0.71M current holding)\n\nIt is clear from comparing the numbers above, there is a need to add to the aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT holdings in order to fullfill the GSM and RWA Strategy commitments.\n\nTapping into the aUSDT and aUSDC holdings is not enough as the current aUSDT (Aave v2) is only sufficient to cover 1 years runway and all the aUSDC will already migrated to aEthUSDC upon implementing Aave Funding Part B.\n\nThe aEthDAI reserve holds sufficient funds to cover any [ImmuneFi Bug Bounty Program](ipns://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/325/), sustain [BGDLabs stream](ipns://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/311/), support this [bug bounty](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-request-for-bounty-payout-december-2023/15826) and this [adhoc security request](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-security-budget-request-december-2023/15783). \n\nAt the time of writing, it is only possible to move funds between the Polygon and Ethereum Treasuries via on-chain governance. The below summaries the expected Polygon Treasury holdings based upon this [migration PR](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/pull/126) being implemented.\n\n* 2.58M aPolUSDC\n* 1.53M aPolDAI\n* 0.80M aPolUSDT\n\nThere is sufficient funds on Polygon to cover the immediate needs of the GHO GSM.\n\nIn addition to the above, this proposal also contains a small bit of house keeping that includes setting two legacy aUSDC Allowances to zero. Whilst the funds mentioned can not be claimed, they are currently showing as available when querying the Allowance ([10.](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBcca60bB61934080951369a648Fb03DF4F96263C#readProxyContract)) balance.\n\nThere are several legacy allowances relating to past bonding curves that are to be [revoked](https://etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker?search=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c). The most notable 174k and 196k, are legacy from previous [CRV](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/146) and [BAL](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115) respectiveley.\n\n# Specification\n\nPart A of this proposal will perform the following:\n\n* Withdraw all amUSDC & aPolUSDC\n* Withdraw all amDAI & aPolDAI\n* Withdraw all amUSDT & aPolUSDT\n* Transfer all withdrawn assets to Ethereum\n\nRevoke the following allowances for the Aave Collector on Mainnet:\n\n`IERC20Token.approve(spender, 0);`\n\n|token|spender|description|\n|---|---|---|\n|aENS|0xa426759e433224c2b04f6619ab44217dad626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aMANA|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aUST|0xa426759e433224c2b04f6619ab44217dad626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|sUSD|0xa426759e433224c2b04f6619ab44217dad626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aUSDC|0x04f90d449d4f8316edd6ef4f963b657f8444a4ca|One Way Bonding Curve|\n|aRAI|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aZRX|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aAMPL|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aSUSD|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aUSDC|0x46a1b7d4a2920270c7eb2c2db4df2259a109bcb4|CRV Bad Debt Repayment|\n|TUSD|0xa426759e433224c2b04f6619ab44217dad626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|BUSD|0xa426759e433224c2b04f6619ab44217dad626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aTUSD|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aDPI|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aFRAX|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n|aBUSD|0xa426759e433224C2b04f6619aB44217DaD626c6e|Aave Collector Consolidation|\n\nPart B of this proposal will perform the following:\n\n* Swap all DAI to USDT\n* Swap 0.70M USDC to USDT\n* Deposit USDT received from Polygon and swaps into Aave v3\n* Deposit USDC received from Polygon minus 0.70M into Aave v3\n\nThis is expected to acheive a minimum of the following aEthUSDC and aEthUSDT balances:\n\n* 4.81M aEthUSDC (3.5M for GSM, 1M for Centrifuge)\n* 3.73M aEthUSDT \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GHO Funding\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-09-17\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication seeks to acquire GHO from secondary markets to support the Aave DAO's short-term funding needs.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe objective of this publication is to further transition Aave DAO's expenses towards being nominated in GHO. The below highlights some potential use cases for GHO:\n\n* 870,000 over 6 months [Aave Grants Continuation Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14831)\n    * Another 300,000 GHO if AAVE is replaced with GHO\n* 75,000 GHO over 3 months [Expansion of “Orbit”](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-expansion-of-orbit-a-dao-funded-delegate-platform-initiative/14785)\n* 406,000 GHO over 3 months [GHO Liquidity Committee](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-create-and-fund-gho-liquidity-committee/14800)\n* TBA Future ACI Funding Request (Renewal mid-October)\n\nAlthough the GHO Liquidity Committee is funded via its own AIP, its inclusion here indicates the magnitude of the potential ongoing spend. The current ACI funding proposal is 250,000 aUSDT, which serves only as a budgetary estimate. Similarly, the 406,000 over the back 3 months of a 6-month lookahead is used as a budgetary estimate.\n\nThe spend identified above over the next 6 months is 1.676M GHO, or 1.976M GHO if AAVE is replaced with GHO within AGD proposal.\n\nThere is also the potential [420,000 GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-swap-b-80bal-20weth-to-gho/14684) being acquired by swapping B-80BAL-20wETH to GHO via the Aave Swap Contract.\n\nThere is also the potential for additional expenses to emerge, such as a renewal proposal from Gauntlet during late Q4 2023. An additional proposal will be presented closer to the time to accommodate any new GHO nominated expenses.\n\nThis publication proposes converting 1.6M of stable coins held in the Ethereum Treasury to GHO. This will complement the existing realized GHO revenue. The GHO is to be held in the Treasury where existing service providers receive payment from.\n\nAt the time of writing, swapping to acquire GHO will generate positive slippage, and the entire swap can be performed without causing GHO to trade above the $1 peg. The Aave DAO can then distribute GHO amongst the community using a price of $1.\n\n# Specification\n\nUsing the Aave Swap Contract, convert the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* 49,900 aDAI v2\n* 69,800 aBUSD v2\n* 75,800 aTUSD v2\n* 381,700 aBUSD v1\n* 400,000 aEthDAI v3\n* 622,800 aUSDT v2\n\nThe GHO will be transferred to the [Aave Ethereum Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c).\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The Aave DAO has placed trust in the signers of this SAFE who have custody of the funds. \n\nThis publication proposes that TokenLogic create a permissioned contract, similar to the Strategic Asset Contract (SAM) to manage this position. The shortExecutor will be in absolute control of the funds and can grant/revoke the Guardian role to enable a SAFE to interact with the auraBAL contract.\n\nDuring the initial deployment of the auraBAL contract, the Guardian role will be assigned to the GLC. The specification section below details the functions to be included on the auraBAL contract. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below specification defines at a high level the functionality that the shortExecutor can assign to the Guardian role:\n\n1) Mint auraBAL using B-80BAL-20wETH\n2) Stake auraBAL to earn yield;\n    2.1) Compounder, or \n    2.2) Classic auraBAL\n3) Claim rewards\n4) Transfer rewards to either Treasury or SAM (vlAURA) or GLC (bribes)\n5) (Optionally) Swap BAL rewards for B-80BAL-20wETH to mint for more auraBAL\n\nIn addition to the above, the Ethereum Executor can also perform the following functionality:\n\n1) Assign the Guardian role \n2) Revoke the Guardian role\n3) Transfer auraBAL to Treasury\n4) Upgrade the contract\n\n# Funding\n\nTo facilitate the development, this publication seeks the following funding:\n\n**Funding Amount:** $14,344 USD, to be paid in GHO.\n**Delivery Schedule:** 5 weeks, which includes the review by @bgdlabs (estimated 2-3 weeks).\n\nIn line with our standard operating practice, the auraBAL contract will be shared with @bgdlabs for review to ensure their completeness.\n\nThe transfer of funds will occur with an AIP submission upon successfully completing the scope. \n\nThe Aave DAO is encouraged to vote on one of the following three options:\n\n1) YAE\n2) NAE\n3) ABSTAIN\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, TokenLogic will commence building the contracts.\n3) Upon delivering the scope, TokenLogic will submit a AIP to create a GHO allowance for equivalent 14,344 USD.\n\nThe DAO is expected to uphold outcome of the Snapshot vote.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
