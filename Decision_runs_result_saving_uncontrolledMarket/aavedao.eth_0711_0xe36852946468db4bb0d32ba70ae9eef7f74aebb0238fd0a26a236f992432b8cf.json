        "body": "# Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding borrow/lend support for StakeWise’s sETH2 on AAVE.\n\n# Motivation\n\nStaking is foundational to the Ethereum network, with liquid staking specifically providing users with the opportunity to unlock the power of their staked capital. One of the most requested features within our protocol is the ability to utilise sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH specifically, given the high correlation between asset prices. Following the launch of eMode within Aave V3, sETH2 would allow for leveraged ETH staking without taking on a lot of risk. Lido’s stETH has proven to be a valuable collateral asset within the Aave ecosystem and it’s time to explore adding sETH2, the second most liquid ETH staking token. This integration would benefit both StakeWise and Aave, bringing new users to both platforms.\n\n### Relevant Links\n\n[Website](https://stakewise.io/)\n[Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/jgf1/Stakewise)\n[Audits - Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)\n[Documentation](https://docs.stakewise.io/)\n[Medium](https://stakewise.medium.com/)\n[Github Page\n](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts)[sETH2 contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a)\n[StakeWise dual tokenomics](https://stakewise.medium.com/the-tokenomics-of-staking-pools-what-are-staked-eth-tokens-and-how-do-they-work-2b4084515711)\n[StakeWise Metro Upgrade](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8)\n\nCommunities: [Discord](https://discord.gg/vM3a3csBDS) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/stakewise_io) / [Forum](https://forum.stakewise.io/)\n\n# Specifications\n\n**What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nI (Jordan Sutcliffe) am the BizDev Lead at StakeWise, submitting the proposal on behalf of StakeWise DAO.\n\n**Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token**\n\n->*StakeWise Overview*\n\nStakeWise is a liquid ETH2 staking platform that removes key barriers to entry, such as requiring 32 ETH and the expertise needed for maintaining staking infrastructure, allowing anyone to benefit from the rewards of the Beacon Chain.\n\nETH deposits into the staking pool are tokenised into sETH2, representing users’ interest-bearing (staked) capital. Staking rewards passively accrue in a separate token, rETH2 (note this application will focus solely on sETH2).\n\nAs a liquid staking platform, users are free to un-stake at any time by trading their sETH2 back into ETH utilising the protocol’s deep liquidity pools.\n\nDmitri Tsumak first announced StakeWise was under development in April 2020. StakeWise launched on mainnet in March 2021, following a 9-month beta phase. StakeWise was the first staking pool to move to non-custodial staking in April 2021 and has since grown to over 70k ETH staked, helping DAOs, whales and individuals alike. In January 2022, the StakeWise Metro upgrade was announced, commencing the decentralisation of the protocol. Further information on Metro can be found [here](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-new-era-for-stakewise-decentralizing-the-architecture-e598fde75ea8).\n\nStakeWise has been audited by [Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits).\n\n->*sETH2 Overview*\n\nsETH2 tokens (ERC-20) represent a tokenised staking deposit into StakeWise’s staking pool. sETH2 is consequently backed 1-to-1 with ETH held within validators. sETH2 acts as an interest-bearing form of wrapped ETH (not re-pricing or rebalancing), providing holders with the right to a share of the staking pool rewards. These rewards are distributed in the form of rETH2.\n\nsETH2 supply sits at [59,266](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfe2e637202056d30016725477c5da089ab0a043a) (~$200M), held by ~3k individual users. The main liquidity pool for sETH2 is on UniSwap ([here](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)). This pool has ~$160M TVL, consisting of ~26k ETH and ~30k sETH2. StakeWise is in the process of launching a second liquidity pool on Curve, with further details provided below.\n\n**Explain the positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nsETH2 is ideal collateral for borrowing ETH, given the high correlation and the proven peg stability of sETH2 (detailed further below). This makes sETH2 a prime candidate for Aave’s new eMode to enable leveraged staking.\n\nsETH2 collateral would also allow holders to take speculative positions, such as shorting an asset or taking a leveraged long position on ETH, for example.\n\nsETH2 has deep liquidity with ~$160M TVL, soon to be spread across multiple pools.\n\n**Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nStakeWise’s background is detailed above.\n\nStakeWise DAO is live and manages the protocol. Whether it is changing the protocol fees, adding node operators to the network or making amendments to smart contracts, all changes require DAO approval. The StakeWise DAO is [community-owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) with all voting rights falling to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\nInvestors in the StakeWise DAO consist of Blockdaemon, boldstart Ventures, Greenfield One, Collider Ventures, Lionschain Capital and gumi Cryptos.\n\nThe StakeWise product suite consists of liquid staking on both Ethereum and Gnosis chain, branching out into other PoS networks over time.\n\n**How is the asset currently used?**\n\nFirst and foremost, sETH2 provides holders, from individual retail stakers to DAOs, the rights to staking rewards from the Beacon Chain.\n\nCreating utility for sETH2 is of the highest priority. Currently, sETH2 can be used to provide liquidity on AMMs, such as UniSwap and Curve. Multiple other integrations are lined up involving sETH2, such as using sETH2 as collateral to borrow against.\n\n**Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. sETH2 is minted only when ETH is deposited into the StakeWise staking pool.\n\n**Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\n-> *Multi-sigs*\n\nStakeWise has run non-custodial ETH staking since April 2021. Prior to April 2021, a multi-sig was used, named the Horcrux, with ~18k ETH of the StakeWise pool currently controlled by the Horcrux. More info can be found [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/stakewise-pool#the-horcrux).\n\nThe DAO treasury is a [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x144a98cb1CdBb23610501fE6108858D9B7D24934) with a DAO committee of 7 persons. The goal of the DAO committee is to monitor transactions voted upon via Snapshot and reject malicious transactions that would harm the protocol. In order to reject a transaction, a threshold of 4 out of 7 committee members must sign the rejection.\n\n1.

The DAO is [community owned](https://docs.stakewise.io/governance/stakewise-dao#tokenomics) and all voting rights fall to holders of SWISE, the StakeWise governance token.\n\n**Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\nMarket Cap ~$167M\n\nVolatility -\n\nsETH2 has proven peg stability. Superimposing stETH / ETH with sETH2 / ETH highlights this stability when compared against stETH which is already whitelisted for Aave.\n\n![|624x205](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iV-tgDKkGvUmpr9MP6D9-qWNApCsLGrTiBqlIGL3K4IfXl2MB--glv35OerGGzZteAOZaAtbKVkCsGhGUuzgxD4JWBDpv76zk0QkfRaEMpIGAuuOuo1Ot6Ey8GF6qRC6c3JHTA60)\n\nNote that StakeWise will soon be adjusting the main UniSwap pool by reducing the fee tier from 0.3% to 0.01%, which is expected to close the remaining gap between sETH2 and ETH. StakeWise is also in the process of launching a new pool on Curve which will further increase sETH2’s peg resilience.\n\n**Volumes and DEXs**\n\n-> [UniSwap V3 Pool (sETH2/ETH)](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x7379e81228514a1d2a6cf7559203998e20598346)\n\nLiquidity: $160M\n\nVolume (24h): ~$350k on avg.\n\n-> [Curve Pool (sETH2/stETH)](https://curve.fi/factory/105)\n\nThis pool is in the final stages of being set up, with the addition of a liquidity gauge ([gauge proposal](https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/165)) passing recently and at least 5k ETH of seed liquidity to be added ([proposal here](https://snapshot.fei.money/#/proposal/0xa4115f24e824b09109991e1e369ba48c60921f503fe3efa4b39d4612eeb51533)).\n\n-> StakeWise is in discussions with multiple other protocols to create further liquidity pools with a diverse range of assets.

Currently, there are 5 oracles live with details provided [here](https://launchpad.eatsteakbewise.com/oraclestatus-mainnet.html). Note that the number of oracles on the network will be increasing from 5 to 10 over the coming months.\n\n4 out of the 5 oracles are required to submit the same rewards data for the total supply of rETH2 is updated. Further information is found [here](https://github.com/stakewise/oracle/blob/master/README.md).\n\nAs previously detailed, the protocol is ultimately governed by the StakeWise DAO. Extra security features are in place to stop malicious transactions from passing through the DAO. For example, each successful on-chain proposal must undergo two days of escalation game, before entering one day of the multi-sig backstop period.\n\n-> *Staking risks*\n\nsETH2 holders are exposed to risks associated with staking, such as slashing events and downtime penalties. The StakeWise DAO has taken steps to mitigate these risks:\n\n* Prospective node operators are vetted by the validator committee, required to enter a testnet and must pass situational stress testing. Only then will the StakeWise DAO vote for whether an operator can join the network. StakeWise only on-boards leading node operators to ensure the highest security and yield for its users.\n* StakeWise provides node operators with an institutional-grade deployment package with embedded security features, such as the ability to quickly transition between staking clients on demand.\n* There is no staking insurance currently in place, however we are working with a third-party to provide protocol-level insurance as a high priority (expected to be in place by early May).\n\nNote that hostage risks are common in liquid staking pools, however this does not apply to StakeWise. The StakeWise DAO controls the exit signatures for its operators, allowing the DAO to force exit validators from the network should the situation arise. This makes it impossible for operators to hold pool funds hostage and will ensure that all future staking rewards, such as MEV and tips, flow to the pool.\n\nStakeWise has experienced no slashing or downtime penalties to date.\n\n-> *Smart Contract Risks*\n\nStakers are exposed to smart contract risk. To mitigate this, the protocol has undergone audits by 3 separate auditors: Runtime Verification, Certik and Omniscia ([reports are here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts/tree/master/audits)). Our code is open-source and available [here](https://github.com/stakewise/contracts).\n\nDespite having no security concerns to date, StakeWise is committed to reducing the risk for its users and is in the process of adding a $200,000 bug bounty program with ImmuneFI.\n\n-> *Price Oracles*\n\nsETH2 currently relies on a UniSwap TWAP oracle. With the addition of new liquidity pools, we will be upgrading our oracle to a Chainlink oracle over the coming months.\n\n# Proposed Risk Parameters\n\n* LTV: 70% (vs 82.5% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Threshold: 75% (vs 85% for ETH)\n* Liquidation Bonus: 7.5% (vs 5% for ETH)\n* Reserve Factor: 10% (vs 10% for ETH)\n\nThe proposed sETH2 risk parameters are presented vs those of ETH and are in line with the current risk parameters of stETH. ETH and sETH2 are highly correlated, and as such, have similar volatility profiles. The LTV and liquidity threshold below that of ETH account for the extra risks associated with liquidating sETH2.\n\n### Interest Rate Model:\n\nUOptimal: 50%\nBase: 0%\nSlope 1: 8%\nSlope 2: 200%\n\n",

CVX is the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCVX is not currently listed on major lending markets, including CVX on the platform would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage. This has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earn asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around $578.04k at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance. Further details can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n##  Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nLlama Community has presented a proposal to deposit Aave community funds into Curve and Convex Finance. Listing CVX on Aave enables Aave to earn aCVX tokens which can then be used to support the treasury management proposal detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?**\n\nConvex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted $CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV.. Adding support for $CVX will in turn provide future opportunities as Convex will also support other protocols in time. ie: FXS\n\nCVX is the governance token of the Convex protocol. By locking $CRV for life on Convex, each user gives his veCRV voting power to vlCVX holders (CVX lockers). Every vlCVX holders can vote on Convex governance proposals but also Curve governance proposals and gauges weights (5.05 veCRV/vlCVX). In the future, each vlCVX holders will control voting power on other tokens like FXS (users already can lock for life FXS for cvxFXS but vlCVX holders cannot vote on Frax governance proposals and gauges weights).\n\n**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nCVX would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem. Adding CVX creates another use case outside of the Convex tokenomics model. Llama expects the CVX demand to be similar to CRV. Additionally:\n\n* Significant Borrow Demand: Users can borrow CVX and then either stake or lock the CVX token to earn yield. In addition to direct yield, investors may borrow CVX to lock and then influence how the inflation schedule of CRV and CVX is distributed. CRV has one of the highest utilisations and dollar value borrowed of all high volatility assets listed on Aave V2.\n* CVX holders can deposit (lend) CVX and then borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).\n\nLlama Community intends to use the aCVX revenue generated to support Treasury Management activities. In this instance, aCVX could be redeemed and locked on Convex to then influence how the CRV and CVX inflation schedule is distributed. Llama Community intends to use the CVX to support growing the Aave and sAave Curve liquidity pools.\n\nThere is $43.2M TVL on the sAAVE pool and $11.8M TVL on the AAVE pool on Convex.\n\nThe Convex community is looking forward to lending and borrowing CVX on Aave. The community will enjoy extra revenues from the reserve factor.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nConvex, as DeFi farmers themselves, the team needed a platform that allowed users to receive the max boost possible from CRV in a simplified manner and allow users to collect their actual rewards directly without auto-selling. They also believe CRV stakers should be rewarded more as they are effectively, mining together with Liquidity Providers. They intend to change that with Convex by charging a lower performance fee, returning fees back to the CRV stakers and CVX token holders, and distributing rewards directly.\n\nThe concept of Convex was published to the public on April 15, 2021 with the protocol launching on May 17, 2021.\n\n30th April 2021 - [Convex platform was whitelisted on the Curve platform](https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-57-whitelist-the-convex-protocol/1654%20and%20Vote%20results:%20https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/44)\n17th May 2022 - [Convex was released](https://convexfinance.medium.com/ready-set-go-69bd68019c5a)\n7th September 2021 - [CVX vote locking went live](https://convexfinance.medium.com/september-update-vote-locking-launch-liquidity-provider-incentives-and-more-1380f406f725)\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**\n\nThe CVX token governs over 559M$ worth of CRV locked in the protocol (and $4M worth of CVX in the Convex treasury multisig). CVX is currently only available on 2 Fuse pools, however there is no liquidity there.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThe emission schedule can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/tokenomics).\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nConvex multisig can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/multisig-admin-rights).\n\n**8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\n* Market capitalisation: $1.35B\n* Average daily volume on the 30 last days: $25,918,420.66\n* CVX is listed on many exchanges, the largest being Gate.io, Sushiswap, Uniswap and Binance Source: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance#markets](http://www.coingecko.com)\n* veCRV controlled /vlCVX: 5.05 veCRV/vlCVX\n\n**9.

        "body": "Proposal by Karpatkey DAO team\n\nThis is a proposal to add GNO, the Gnosisdao’s governance token, as collateral in the Aave v2 protocol.\n\nGnosisdao is a collective that uses GNO to transparently guide decisions on the development of Gnosis products. It has produced solutions which are widely adopted in our ecosystem, such as the Gnosis Safe multisignature wallet, Zodiac (DAO tooling consisting of Avatars, Modules, Modifiers, and Guards architecture), Gnosis Auction (a platform for conducting fair, transparent, and decentralized batch auctions) and Cowswap (which allows anyone to buy and sell tokens using gas-less orders that are settled peer-to-peer among its users or into any on-chain liquidity source while providing MEV protection), among others.\n\nThe GNO token allows its holders to be validators and boost their rewards on the Gnosis Chain network (formerly the xDai Chain). The Gnosis Chain provides stability and scalability. It is a stable EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain designed for fast and inexpensive transactions. The Gnosis Chain currently has a TVL of $290M, with 130k+ transactions a day, an average block time of 5 seconds, and holds over 6.1M wallets.\nUseful Links\n\n    Gnosis Chain: EVM 2\n    Gnosisdao: Gnosis GnosisDAO 2\n    Governance forum: GnosisDAO - Gnosis\n    Gnosis Chain Information & Resources: https://gnosischain.world/\n    Gnosis Blog: https://blog.gnosis.pm/\n    Gnosis Docs: Gnosis Developer Portal Gnosis Protocol · Gnosis Protocol\n\nMotivation\n\nThe community has shown increased interest in using GNO to earn additional yield without exposing it to significant risk. This is evident through the growth of GNO pools on the following protocols, with an aggregated TVL of $108M+, making it a significantly liquid token:\nMainnet: $82.8M Total\n\nBalancer v2: $53.7M Total\n\n    GNO + WETH: $50.3M\n    ​​GNO/COW: $3.4M\n\nUniswap V3: $29.11M\n\n    GNO + WETH: $28.2M\n    GNO/COW: $0.91M\n\nGnosis Chain: $25.42M Total\n\nSWAPR: $7.02M Total\n\n    WETH/GNO: $4.84M\n    GNO/WXDAI: $2.18M\n\nHoneyswap: $7.07M Total\n\n    WETH/GNO: $4.46M\n    GNO/WXDAI: $1.42M\n    GNO/NODE: $0.43M\n    CRV/GNO: $0.42M\n    GNO/FLX: $0.34M\n\nSushiswap: $4.5M Total\n\n    WETH/GNO: $4.5M\n\nSymmetric: $5.73M Total\n\n    GNO + WETH: $3.25M\n    GNO + WXDAI: $2.48M\n\nElk: $1.1M Total\n\n    WETH + GNO: $1.1M\n\nThere is also $7.8M GNO supplied as collateral in Unit Protocol, a Makerdao-like protocol. It has consistently been used at the collateral cap, which shows interest of the community to use it as a quality collateral.\nRisk Mitigation\n\nHere is an analysis based on Aave’s Asset Risk Framework 20 2 to quantify GNO’s risks and the resulting model parameters suggestions.\n\nGNO’s Overall Risk is B\nRisk Type \tRisk Factor \tMeasure Unit \tValue \tSource \tRisk Rating according to Aave Criteria\nSmart Contract \tMaturity \tDays \t1.809 \tCompare Cryptocurrencies Ethereum vs Gnosis \tA+\nSmart Contract \tTransactions \tunits \t280.814 \t\tC+\nCounterparty \tHolders \taddresses \t15.463 \tPrecio, gráficos, capitalización de mercado de Gnosis (GNO) | CoinMarketCap \tC+\nCounterparty \tPermission \t\tCentralized with Audit \tGnosis \tD+\nMarket \tMarket Cap \t10^6 USD \t649 \t\tB+\nMarket \tAverage Volume 1M \t10^6 USD \t12 \tCalculated with data from coingecko.com \tC\nMarket \tAverage Volume 3M \t10^6 USD \t5 \tCalculated with data from coingecko.com \tC\nMarket \tNormalizaed Daily Volatility 1M \t% \t0,0594 \tCalculated with data from coingecko.com \tB-\nMarket \tNormalizaed Daily Volatility 3M \t% \t0,0552 \tCalculated with data from coingecko.com \tB-\nMarket \tNormalizaed Daily Volatility 6M \t% \t0,0574 \tCalculated with data from coingecko.com \tB-\n\nSupport document: GNO Token Risk Matrix - Google Sheets 2\nSpecifications\n\n    What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nKarpatkey DAO provides treasury management solutions for DAOs and currently manages Gnosis DAO’s treasury initiatives.\n\n    Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nPlease refer to the summary above.\n\n    Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n    GNO’s liquidity is comparable or better than the top 3 DeFi protocol tokens listed on Aave by total supply (AAVE, LINK and MKR). This means it can be sold at large quantities with lower price impact, resulting in a better quality collateral for liquidations. Also, a more liquid asset tends to be less volatile than an illiquid one.\n\nThe GnosisDAO community and treasury would be the main interested parties in depositing GNO and borrowing stablecoins, increasing the Ethereum Reserve Factor.\n\nIt would set a good precedent to continue working with other GnosisDAO products for tighter Aave integrations, like v3 for Gnosis Chain and Safe apps for multisig users.\n\n    Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nGnosis was founded in 2015 by Martin Koppelmann and Stefan George under ConsenSys, an Ethereum venture production studio. On 23-Nov-2020 GnosisDAO was born, a prediction market-driven collective, stewarding the Gnosis ecosystem through futarchy: governance by prediction markets. Gnosis’ products are the following:\n\nGnosis Auction: Gnosis Auction is a platform for conducting fair, transparent, and decentralized token price discovery. Batch auctions set the price exactly where supply and demand meet. This ensures the same fair price for all participants. Also, timed batches protect the users from frontrunning.\n\nZodiac 1: a collection of tools for DAOs, built according to an open standard, which enables DAOs to act more like constellations, connecting platforms, protocols, and chains, no longer confined to monolithic designs.\n\nConditional Tokens Framework: powering decentralized prediction markets like the Omen platform.\n\nGnosis Protocol V2: leveraging batch auctions to offer MEV protection, plus integration with liquidity sources across DEXs to provide traders with the best prices. Within the Gnosis Protocol V2, the proof-of-concept CowSwap DEX was born, as well as the Balancer-Gnosis partnership integration, aiming to build a stable version of GPv2 on top of the Balancer V2 vault.\n\nGnosis Safe: The most trusted platform to manage digital assets on Ethereum, with over 107 billion USD worth of digital assets securely stored. It has web, desktop and mobile versions. Supporting multi-signature, DeFi integrations, enhanced privacy, NFTs storage, gasless signatures. The Gnosis Safe is open source and has been formally verified 2.\n\n    How is the asset currently used?\n    GNO is used in the following ways:\n\n    Prediction market-driven governance token\n    As the asset required to validate on the Gnosis Chain\n    Yield compounding strategies in DeFI (e.g. Balancer, Uniswap, Sushiswap, etc.)\n    Decentralized borrowing (e.g.: Unit Protocol)\n    As a productive asset (e.g.: part of Balancer Protocol’s token swap strategy)\n\n    Emission schedule: There is no emission schedule, the total supply of 10M GNO with most of the supply in the vesting contract locked for 8 years. The total supply will likely be drastically reduced , check the ongoing governance process Should we burn 68% of the total GNO Supply? - GnosisDAO - Gnosis 1\n\n    Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nNo additional GNO can be minted.\n\n    Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n    Market Cap: $655,513,507\n    24h Volume: $4,483,973\n    Exchanges:\n\n    Uniswap (v3)\n\n    Binance\n\n    Bitvavo\n\n    XT.COM\n\n    Digifinex\n\n    Kraken\n\n    Gate.io\n\n    BTCEX\n\n    Bitfinex\n\n    Bancor Network\n\n    LATOKEN\n\n    CoinEx\n\n    Bittrex\n\n    AscendEX (BitMax)\n\n    Balancer (v2)\n\n    Nominex\n\n    Uniswap (v2)\n\n    NiceHash\n\n    Honeyswap\n\n    WazirX\n\n    ZB\n\n    HitBTC\n\n    Sushiswap\n\n    Balancer (Arbitrum)\n\n    Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\n    Twitter 1: 120.1K\n    Discord: 9.7K\n    Telegram: 17.9K\n    Telegram announcement: 2.6K\n\nNewsletter: ~10K",

        "body": "---\naip: <to be assigned>\ntitle: Add FEI to Aave V2\nstatus: Proposed\nauthor: Joey Santoro (@joeysantoro), Brianna Montgomery (@bpm6867)\nshortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the FEI stablecoin\ndiscussions: https://discord.gg/aDeErjS6Dt\ncreated: 2021-06-16\nupdated: N/A\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in lending markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: lending, synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n27K followers on Twitter, 2 17k members in Discord 3, Github\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\tDate of Deployment: March 28, 2021\n\tNumber of Transactions: 81,798\n\tNumber of Holders: 4,089\n\n## Rationale\nBecause FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing and lending. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0x08bbB5922550e6992ebDA8252A31AA02924EF28A\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0xa4893779e193AbD23CE494e5400ca340033606C7\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0xa4767eA500bc04430dE609A523CDc99c9537867C\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0x9f7663e34a2c2Be586126Eed5AF4651b062a51A6\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

        "body": "Author: QiDao Protocol core team\nForum post: https://governance.aave.com/t/add-mai-on-aave-v3/7630\n\nProposal to add support for MAI (aka miMatic) on Aave V3 (On Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche)\n\n### Summary\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin project on Polygon and Fantom. It is an overcollateralized stablecoin that is non-custodial. All MAI is backed by collateral locked in user-managed vaults. MAI minting is available on 8 chains, and bridging to 18 chains.\n\nAll accepted collaterals are priced using Chainlink price feeds. MAI has stayed within its peg through several market downturns.\n\nThere’s around 250M MAI minted, with liquidity on all top DEXs in which MAI is present. A significant portion of liquidity for MAI is on Curve. MAI hosts the largest pool on Curve Polygon and the pool with most volume on Curve Fantom.\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\n* V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 97% LTV, 98% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n* V3 Isolation mode: 75% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor, $50M initial debt ceiling per chain\n\n### Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nCore team at QiDao Protocol.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nMAI is the first and largest stablecoin protocol on Polygon. It allows users to lock their tokens and use them as collateral to mint MAI at 0% interest.\n\nMAI is an overcollateralized CDP stablecoin on Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Harmony, Moonriver, and Gnosis Chain. MAI is one of the most crosschain assets in DeFi, currently on 18 chains through Multichain. Accepted collateral includes interest-bearing assets like Aave Market Tokens. Users are not charged interest for borrowing MAI - instead, they are charged a 0.5% fee upon repayment.\n\nDespite market downturns during its existence, MAI has maintained its peg.\n\nMAI currently has a TVL of around $350M, and has around 250M MAI outstanding.\n\n3. Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\nBeing the largest native stablecoin on Polygon and Fantom, MAI has a wide reach within the native projects on those chains. Listing MAI would connect Aave to most communities in these chains through the integrations already made by MAI.\n\nMAI is one of the most crosschain assets, available on 18 chains through canonical bridging. As a result, users will be drawn to borrow MAI to bridge value to other chains and take advantage of the many yield opportunities that MAI has.\n\nMAI’s risk profile is low. It is used by large institutions like Celsius and Polygon. MAI has also received grants from several blockchains, including Polygon, Fantom, Harmony, Aurora, and IoTeX.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\n* MAI is governed by the QiDao Protocol, a community-run DAO around the QI token.\n* Several other projects have participated in our DAO through proposals and bribing, including Frax Finance, Stake DAO, Celsius, * PolygonDAO, SpiritSwap, SpookySwap, Gotchi Vault, and Beefy Finance\n* The Polygon Alliance was recently set up to participate in QiDao.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\n* Lending (Market.xyz, Impermax, Tarot)\n* Listed on several DEXs on 18 chains. Main DEXs are Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Solidly, Saber, and TombSwap\n* Top two pools on Curve Fantom and Polygon\n* MAI is used by Celsius to borrow against their AUM\n* MAI has been used by Polygon to award bounties\n* MAI offers low-cost leverage to strategies on Stake DAO, Yearn, Beefy, and Aave\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nUsers can mint MAI by locking up their assets and borrowing against that value at 0% interest. Temporary debt ceilings serve as the a supply mitigation.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll funds stored as collateral are fully controlled by users\nThere is a 3/5 multisig, comprised by the QiDao team. Team members are doxxed and regularly appear on podcasts, live streams, and crypto conferences\nThe multisig executes the results of Snapshot votes: liquidation ratios for new collaterals, partnerships, and debt ceilings. There have been over 70 votes since the start of the DAO: see votes here 1.\nSince the protocol uses canonical bridging, QiDao retains the power to mint MAI on chains it is bridged to.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n* Market Cap: ~$250M\n* 24h Volume: >$40M\n* Volatility: Low\n* Exchanges: Curve, Balancer, QuickSwap, SpookySwap, SpiritSwap, Saber, Beethoven, Solidly, TombSwap, Solarbeam, Trader Joe, Crodex, ZoomSwap, PaintSwap, Elk Finance, and Rose\n* Maturity: Launched 5/4/21\n\n9.
