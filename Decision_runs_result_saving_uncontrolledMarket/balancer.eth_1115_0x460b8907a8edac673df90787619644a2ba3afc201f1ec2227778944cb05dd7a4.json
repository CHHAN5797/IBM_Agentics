This proposal does not intend to allocate any BEETS into the 8020 pool required for maBEETS governance participation, but this does reduce the overhead in doing so and minimize any risk of not being able to bridge BEETS at a later date. Since [BIP-607](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-607-update-ftm-multisig-to-claim-vested-beets/5717) will be executed on shortly by the DAO multisig, the BEETS balancer of 10M tokens will be in the Maxi Omni-chain multisig which, if this proposal passes, will facilitate the bridging of BEETS to Sonic and the transfer of the bridged BEETS to the newly deployed DAO Multisig on Sonic.\n\n#### Technical specifications:\n\nFor reference the Sonic Maxi Omni-chain multisig and DAO Multisig addresses can be confirmed in the bal_addresses repo [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/a3080be58e203f37ea31bcdec5aa30410526a059/extras/multisigs.json#L106).\n\nThe pre-requisite for this transaction is the execution of the claim and transfer of BEETS on Fantom by the DAO Multisig to the Omni-Chain Multisig outlined in BIP-607.\n\nThe Maxi Omni-Chain Multisig `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e` will interact with the BEETS token ftm:`0xf24bcf4d1e507740041c9cfd2dddb29585adce1e` and call `approve`, with the amount of `10000000000000000000000000`, passing `BeetsProxyOFTV2` as the spender `0x8d038da833b154ebcfb7965a9ee7c4ad72671b21`.\n\nThe Maxi Omni-chain multisig will then interact with the `BeetsProxyOFTV2` by calling `sendFrom` with the following arguments:\n\n1_from `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e`\n\n2_dstChainId `332`\n\n3_toAddress\n\n`0x0000000000000000000000009ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e`\n\n4_amount `10000000000000000000000000`\n\n4_callParams.refundAddress `0x9ff471F9f98F42E5151C7855fD1b5aa906b1AF7e`\n\n_callParams.zroPaymentAddress `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n\n_callParams.adapterParams\n\n`0x0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001adb0`\n\nThis will result in the Omni-Chain Multisig receiving lzBEETS on Sonic, which must be converted to native BEETS. To do so the Omni-chain Multisig will interact with the `BeetsOFTV2` `0x1e5fe95fb90ac0530f581c617272cd0864626795` on Sonic by approving the amount `10000000000000000000000000` of with the spender set to the `SonicBeetsMigrator` `0x5f9a5CD0B77155AC1814EF6Cd9D82dA53d05E386`.\n\nIn the same transaction, the omni chain multisig will interact with the `SonicBeetsMigrator` `0x5f9a5CD0B77155AC1814EF6Cd9D82dA53d05E386`, writing the function `exchangeOperaToSonic` with the amount `10000000000000000000000000`.\n\nOnce completed and the BEETS balance is received by the Omni-chain multisig, the safe will call `transfer` on the native BEETS token `0x2D0E0814E62D80056181F5cd932274405966e4f0`, passing the Sonic DAO Mutlisig `0x4f22C2784Cbd2B24a172566491Ee73fee1A63c2e` as the to(address) and the amount `10000000000000000000000000`.",

The fourth lock of 2.00m AURA will expire and can be relocked after Feb 6th and before the unlock date of Feb 13th, 2025:\n\n![Bildschirmfoto 2025-01-27 um 11.00.39.png](ipfs://bafkreiaxrpzohea46d4irgsa3jzgjdbekurv7y4gmfv4tpx3qpv3u5airi)\n\nThe DAO therefore wishes to relock its current position in the classical way by executing a “manual” relock via the DAO multi-sig—similar to [BIP-720](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-720-manual-relock-of-balancer-daos-vlaura/6092) sixteen weeks ago.\n\n### Postponing of Unlock and relock on new Multi-sig\n\nAn automatic relock Safe module was developed and voted in with [[BIP-715]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-715-enable-automatic-aura-relocking/6077). However, it was concluded by various DAO members that installing a Safe module on the DAO multi-sig might raise serious safety concerns.\n\nTo circumvent this, we aim to unlock and transfer the vlAURA at some point. However, given the current market situation and focus on a successful v3 launch and gauge bootstrapping, we can’t afford any unlock period as it would mean that the DAO would miss out on a 2 week emission cycle. Therefore, this action will be postponed until further notice.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the vlAURA contract at `0x3fa73f1e5d8a792c80f426fc8f84fbf7ce9bbcac` and call `processExpiredLocks` with argument `true` - The execution needs to be timed AFTER unix timestamp 1738796400 (Feb 6th 00:00 GMT) and BEFORE timestamp 1739404800 (Feb 13th 00:00 GMT) !",

While spending some to accelerate our growth certainly makes sense I believe it’s prudent to retain the majority as a long term bet on Arbitrum’s future. Balancer has seen promising early signs of momentum on Arbitrum like the launch of wstETH, rETH, Aave v3 boosted pools, and the adoption of ve8020 by two Arbitrum native projects (y2k and Radiant). Future catalysts like Aura going multichain, bridging over more rate providers like cbETH, and gyroscope's ECLP put us in a strong position to potentially become the top DEX on Arbitrum.\n\n**I suggest allocating 1M ARB towards direct LP incentives as this is the most direct growth mechanism in my view.**\n\nThe USD amount of bribes placed has fallen significantly in line with the decline in BAL & AURA prices. If we use ARB to bribe I believe we’ll only accelerate the reduction in 3rd party bribing activity as we push the ROI closer to 1:1. I’d argue this leads to no gain at all for voters and would be a waste of 1M ARB.\n\nDirectly emitting ARB on the pools seems to be a better option as that increases the amount of emissions up for grabs, thus pushing the ROI for bribers up rather than down. Of course this program is limited to incentivizing Arbitrum pools so it is fair to say only the ROI for Arbitrum bribers goes up - more Arbitrum bribers pushes down the ROI for everyone else and these two things cancel each other out to a large extent. Bottom line is more total emissions should lead to more bribes given we’re effectively pushing 1:1 ROI lately.\n\nI’ll propose the following rule set:\n\n* 10 round duration, aligning with Aura’s two week cycle of voting incentive allocations.\n* Max of 100k ARB per round. Any unspent ARB simply returns to the treasury.\n* Each pool can have a max possible allocation of 10k ARB per round to prevent one or two pools from taking the majority share of this program.\n* On each Wednesday/Thursday after Aura’s gauge voting snapshot, ARB will be allocated to each Arbitrum pool according to bribes placed in the most recent round on a 1:1 USD basis, subject to ARB caps mentioned above.\n* This ARB will be emitted over a two week period\n* All voting markets are included - projects can choose where to bribe at their discretion. Bribes placed by Balancer under BIP-19 also count.\n* Balancer Maxis will publish a spreadsheet detailing the ARB allocation every two weeks and allow at least 24h for community feedback before execution. We’ll make a forum thread for this purpose.\n* This would not begin until the first Aura voting round after Aura is deployed and ready to emit AURA rewards.\n\n**For the remaining 2M ARB I suggest deploying protocol owned liquidity in combination with Aura by pairing it 33/33/33 with BAL and AURA.**\n\nAura recently passed [AIP-25](https://forum.aura.finance/t/aip-25-approve-aura-for-arbitrum-liquidity/461) to signal their support for this. Fry (aura contributor) has deployed an [escrow contract](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8D803f7f7e26E586ee90E5A872cf7830e21f7727#writeContract) to hold the BPT which has been reviewed by Balancer's integrations team. \n\nThis creates TVL, volume, and revenue that we don’t need to spend incentives on. By increasing BAL & AURA liquidity on Arbitrum we make it easier for second order integrations like autocompounders to support Balancer pools. If another use case for ARB presents itself like participating in governance or another incentives program the liquidity can always be withdrawn.\n\n### Specification\n\nIf approved, the DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the official Arbitrum bridge at https://bridge.arbitrum.io/ using the wallet connect app in gnosis safe. \nBased on current market prices and factoring in a ~5% cushion,  500k BAL will be bridged and should be sufficient for  LP.   Any remaining BAL will be held in the DAO multisig on Arbitrum.  The destination address will be `arb1:0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0` the Arbitrum Balancer Treasury.  A small test transaction will be executed before the majority of the funds are sent in the multisig execution the week following the test. \n\nOnce Aura lets us know they're ready to send AURA to the escrow contract the Arbitrum Treasury `arb1:0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0` will transfer 2M ARB and some amount of BAL up to the 500k max, based on current market prices, to `0x8D803f7f7e26E586ee90E5A872cf7830e21f7727`. Aura's multisig will then call init() and join().\n\nFor the 1M ARB incentives program, the Arbitrum Treasury `arb1:0xaF23DC5983230E9eEAf93280e312e57539D098D0` will transfer 100k ARB on a bi-weekly basis to the Maxi LM Multisig `arb1:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860`. Any funds unused in each bi-weekly period will be returned to the treasury immediately. The first transfer should take place June 19th.",
