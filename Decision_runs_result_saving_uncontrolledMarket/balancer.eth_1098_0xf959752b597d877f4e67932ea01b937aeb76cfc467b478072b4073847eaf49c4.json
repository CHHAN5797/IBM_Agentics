        "body": "In order to initiate operations as per [BIP-103](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-103-karpatkey-balancer-treasury-cu-proposal-update/3895), Karpatkey respectfully requests the Balancer DAO to take the following actions:\n\n1. Dismantle specific positions on the current multisigs on Mainnet, Polygon, and Arbitrum (as outlined in the Execution Details section);\n2. Bridge specific in-scope assets from Polygon and Arbitrum back to Mainnet (as outlined in the Execution Details section);\n3. Transfer all in-scope assets (totaling approximately $5,900,000 as of the day of this writing) to a new SAFE provided by Karpatkey and owned by the Balancer DAO (as outlined in the Next Steps and Execution Details sections).\n\n## Motivation\n\nAfter internal discussion, the Karpatkey team has determined that the Balancer DAO would be best served by a simpler and more direct approach. Since Karpatkey has already been voted in as the treasury manager, there is no longer a need for further discussion or a new vote on the specific allocation of funds, despite having recently proposed the \"Base vs Expanded allocation\" approach.\n\nTo streamline deployment, Karpatkey proposes beginning with the base allocation and then expanding as needed. This approach takes advantage of the Zodiac Roles Modifier permissions preset that has already been created and tested for allowlisting specific functions and protocols related to the base allocation. Karpatkey intends to move forward with this approach and will propose future adjustments in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the original proposal. However, any future adjustments to the strategy, and thus the preset, will ultimately require the approval of the Balancer DAO through the execution of a batch of transactions to apply the adjusted preset.\n\n### Zodiac Roles Modifier preset to be applied\n\nThe original post proposed the following:\n\n[quote=\"karpatkey, post:1, topic:4220\"]\n## Base allocation\n\nIf this proposal was selected, specific functions within the protocols below would be whitelisted. More technical details regarding the whitelisting process will be provided shortly.\n\n* Staking:\n  * Lido\n  * Stakewise\n* Lending:\n  * Compound v2\n  * Aave v2\n* AMM:\n  * Uniswap v3\n[/quote]\n\nTo increase flexibility and adapt to changing market conditions, Karpatkey suggests expanding protocols and functions to include ETH wrappers and unwrappers, swaps on Balancer and Uniswap v3. These swaps, except for regularly swapped reward tokens, are intended to provide Karpatkey with the ability to take immediate action in specific market conditions, such as a stablecoin losing its peg. The pools were chosen based on liquidity to maximize results for the Balancer DAO, but new permissions may be necessary as market conditions change.\n\nThe Manager preset consists of the complete list of permissions that Karpatkey asks the Balancer DAO to grant. This list can be found in this [Annex Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gtLsmCexiY0XWFwWdgpEaq2wgNDW7Z0ZvsX7p5-C2E/edit?usp=sharing). Through the Zodiac Role Modifier, the Manager preset will be applied to the Manager Role, which in turn will be assigned to Karpatkey’s Manager SAFE.\n\n### Future permissions and roles\n\nOnce the initial strategy is deployed, there will be a periodic need to adapt the portfolio to changing market conditions. If a particular strategy no longer provides sufficient yield, or if a particular pool in which the Balancer DAO has a position becomes deprecated and needs to be migrated, new permissions will be required.\n\nIn addition, creating new roles to improve or expand operations will also be necessary. Two new roles are planned for the near future: the *Harvester Role* and the *Swapper Role*. Both roles will be granted specific subsets of the Manager preset permissions and will be assigned to EOAs to automate certain tasks. The Harvester Role will be allowed to claim rewards, while the Swapper Role will be allowed to swap these rewards for ETH or stablecoins.\n\nWhen deemed appropriate, Karpatkey will create a new forum post requesting the Balancer DAO to update the preset or deploy new roles. The post will include an explanation of why the permissions and/or roles are needed and the executable payload. The proposal will need to be passed by the community and, once approved, it will be executed by the multisig according to the DAO standard operating practices. It is important that this process is as simple and straightforward as possible, since every day of waiting may represent an opportunity cost to the DAO's treasury. A summary of the new permissions and/or roles will be included as a separate section in every corresponding weekly report.\n\n### Next steps\n\nThe next steps for implementing this proposal are as follows:\n\n1. Karpatkey will create a new SAFE, deploy the Roles Modifier contract, and apply the Manager Role preset (as outlined in the Annex Document) to simplify the process for the Balancer DAO.\n2. Karpatkey will conduct a small-scale replication of the strategy for a second round of testing.\n3. Once the SAFE is created, tested, and permissions are applied, Karpatkey will transfer ownership of it to the Balancer DAO and remove themselves as owner.\n4. This proposal will be submitted to Snapshot for approval.\n5. If the proposal is approved, the Balancer DAO will execute the steps described in the Execution Details section.\n\n### Execution details\n\nThe following list is intended to serve as a clear execution roadmap for the Balancer DAO once (if) this proposal is approved:\n\n1. Dismantle the Balancer Boosted AAVE USD position on Mainnet and withdraw 100% of the funds in DAI.\n2. Dismantle WBTC + ETH position on Mainnet and withdraw the two assets in equal proportion.\n3. Dismantle ETH + GTC position on Mainnet and withdraw the two assets in equal proportion.\n4. Dismantle MATIC + USDC + WETH + BAL position on Polygon and withdraw the four assets in equal proportion.\n5. Bridge USDC and WETH from Polygon back to Mainnet.\n6. Dismantle WBTC + WETH + USDC position on Arbitrum and withdraw the three assets in equal proportion.\n7. Bridge WBTC, WETH + USDC from Arbitrum back to Mainnet.\n8. Transfer in-scope assets to the new SAFE. The approximate balances (as of the day of this writing) of in-scope assets that will be transferred are:\n\n|Token|Price|Approx Balance|Total Value|Share %|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|USDC|$1.00|2,514,827|$2,514,827|42.61%|\n|AAVE|$79.50|16,907|$1,344,129|22.77%|\n|stETH|$1,542.51|312.86|$482,590|8.18%|\n|WETH|$1,552.80|266.81|$414,301|7.02%|\n|wstETH|$1,707.08|155.02|$264,632|4.48%|\n|DAI|$1.00|239,996|$239,996|4.07%|\n|WBTC|$21,007.20|11.06|$232,289|3.94%|\n|USDT|$1.00|218,949|$218,949|3.71%|\n|ETH|$1,553.00|122.82|$190,733|3.23%|\n|Grand Total|||$5,902,446|100.00%|\n\n### Specification\n\nKarpatkey has prepared the Gnosis safe on Ethereum at `0x0EFcCBb9E2C09Ea29551879bd9Da32362b32fc89`.

        "body": "# Investment Policy Statement\n\n## Abstract\n\nIntroduction of an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for Balancer DAO Treasury management.\n\n## Introduction\n\nOfficially established in November 2022, as per [BIP-103](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-103-karpatkey-balancer-treasury-cu-proposal-update/3895), The Balancer DAO Treasury has grown to play a critical role in supporting the protocol’s operations, resilience, and long-term sustainability. As both the DeFi landscape and the DAO’s priorities evolve, it’s important to establish a shared framework for how Treasury assets are managed.\n\nThis IPS aligns with the ongoing [Treasury Migration Proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-dao-treasury-assets-migration/6489), which consolidates assets into the kpk-managed multisig to enhance execution and asset management, and reinforces our commitment as Treasury Managers.\n\nThis post introduces an Investment Policy Statement (IPS), developed by kpk in collaboration with Balancer DAO contributors. The IPS is designed to:\n\n1. Define and assign the responsibilities of all involved parties.\n2. Establish clear investment goals and objectives for Treasury assets.\n3. Provide guidance and limitations to the Treasury Manager in executing strategy.\n4. Ensure Treasury assets are managed according to prudent and transparent standards.\n\nOverall, the IPS aims to strike a balance: it should provide enough structure to guide day-to-day execution, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to changing DAO needs.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis Investment Policy Statement (“IPS”) outlines the principles and guidelines for the effective management of the Balancer DAO Treasury (the “Treasury”). It establishes a clear understanding among DAO participants regarding the purpose, constraints, and governance structure around the Treasury, with the goal of:\n\n- Planning appropriate asset allocation and implementation of Treasury strategies.\n- Supporting informed financial planning across the DAO.\n- Establishing accountability and transparency for all involved parties.\n\nThis document also distinguishes between Treasury assets managed under the kpk mandate and those retained directly by the DAO.\n\n## Background\n\n### History of Balancer\n\nLaunched in 2020, Balancer DAO governs the Balancer Protocol, a decentralised automated market maker (AMM) designed to support flexible and efficient liquidity pools. Built on Ethereum and EVM compatible chains, Balancer enables users to both swap tokens and manage self-balancing pools with multiple tokens and customisable weights. Governance and protocol upgrades are managed by the Balancer DAO through community proposals and token voting. Further technical details can be found in the Balancer Documentation.\n\n### Purpose of Balancer DAO\n\nThe Balancer DAO community has progressively aligned around a shared mission: to develop and steward a decentralised protocol for programmable liquidity. The DAO aims to ensure the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of the Balancer ecosystem — driving innovation in AMM infrastructure and strengthening the protocol’s position in the ecosystem. Treasury assets, and any income generated by these assets, are used to fund protocol development, ecosystem grants, security initiatives, and incentive programmes that drive usage, growth, and resilience across supported networks.\n\n### History of kpk\n\nFounded in 2020, kpk is a DeFi-native treasury management organisation focused on secure, transparent, and non-custodial asset management for DAOs.\n\nkpk specialises in active deployment of DAO funds into carefully vetted DeFi strategies, combining rigorous risk management with a trust-minimised approach that preserves DAO self-custody. The team has developed proprietary monitoring tools, automated execution agents, and governance-integrated frameworks to serve some of the most prominent DAOs in the ecosystem, including Gnosis, Aave, ENS, CoW, Safe, Arbitrum, Nexus Mutual, and dYdX.\n\n### Purpose of kpk\n\nkpk empowers organisations to confidently navigate on-chain finance by securing, managing, and growing their digital assets. kpk deploys yield-bearing strategies with both world-class risk management and operational excellence.\n\nWith non-custodial management, funds always stay under the client’s control. kpk just gets the permissions needed to act on the DAO’s behalf — no assets are transferred to kpk directly for management. Roles contracts are used to define a set of pre-approved permissions that the DAO grants kpk in order to execute on their behalf. Any and all actions that are not present in these permissions contracts will not be actionable by kpk as Treasury Manager.\n\n## Purpose of the Investment Policy Statement\n\nThe Investment Policy Statement (“IPS”) has been developed by kpk in collaboration with Balancer DAO to:\n\n1. Clarify the roles and responsibilities of all relevant parties.\n2. Provide a shared understanding of the objectives and intended outcomes for the DAO’s Treasury assets.\n3. Offer direction and guardrails for the Treasury Manager in executing investment activities.\n4. Set a reference point for assessing the Treasury Manager’s performance.\n5. Ensure Treasury assets are managed in line with sound, responsible practices.\n\n## Governance and Oversight\n\n### Responsibilities of Balancer DAO\n\nThe responsibilities of Balancer DAO include, but are not limited to:\n\n- **Establishing Objectives**: Defining the investment goals, risk tolerance, liquidity targets, and any relevant operational or strategic constraints.\n- **Approving the IPS**: Formally approving this document and any future revisions through governance processes.\n- **Oversight and Review**: Reviewing the Treasury’s alignment with objectives and constraints outlined in this IPS. This includes evaluating strategy fit, operational soundness, and alignment with the DAO’s evolving needs.\n- **Communication**: Informing the Treasury Manager of any significant changes to DAO priorities, mandates, or financial conditions that could affect treasury management.\n- **Reviewing and Revising the IPS**: Periodically reviewing the IPS and revising it as necessary in response to changes in the DAO’s circumstances or broader market context.\n\nIPS review is expected to occur on an annual basis, or sooner if material changes arise. The Balancer DAO community is responsible for initiating and approving changes through its governance process (e.g., Snapshot proposals and forum discussions).\n\n### Responsibilities of the Treasury Manager\n\nkpk acts as Balancer DAO’s Treasury Manager, as designated by [BIP-103]. Within this role, kpk is responsible for:\n\n- **Strategy Implementation**: Executing treasury strategies in accordance with this IPS and DAO-approved permissions.\n- **Deployment**: Actively managing capital in risk-adjusted, yield-generating DeFi strategies.\n- **Reporting**: Providing regular updates, including monthly financial reports and presentations, and supporting documentation for governance discussions.\n- **Risk Management**: Continuously monitoring exposure across market, counterparty, smart contract, liquidity, and governance risks. Ensuring response mechanisms are in place to reduce risk.\n- **Communication**: Maintaining an open line of communication with the DAO and proactively disclosing material changes or considerations that may impact the treasury.\n- **Support**: Assisting in ad hoc financial projects, partnership evaluations, or strategy reviews relevant to treasury health and ecosystem alignment.\n\nAll actions are executed within the scope of pre-approved roles and permissions assigned by the DAO. kpk cannot take any action not explicitly allowed by the DAO’s permissions system.\n\n## Treasury Objectives\n\nThe primary objective of Balancer DAO’s Treasury is to ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the DAO, while maintaining operational flexibility and capital preservation. The Treasury aims to support the DAO’s current and future needs without the need to liquidate core DAO-native assets. As the Treasury grows over time, it is expected that investment returns will contribute to funding operational expenses, either partially or in full.\n\n### Investment Objectives\n\nThis objective is pursued through a conservative investment approach, with a focus on:\n\n- **Capital Preservation**: The Treasury should prioritize safeguarding principal value. Deployment should avoid unnecessary risk and be focused on stable, proven DeFi strategies. Avoiding capital loss is a core principle of the Treasury mandate.\n- **Risk-Adjusted Yield Generation**: Where appropriate, Treasury assets may be deployed to generate yield, provided the strategy meets conservative risk parameters and maintains liquidity standards. The purpose of yield is not to speculate, but to extend the life of the Treasury and reduce the need for DAO-native asset liquidations.\n- **Growth of Capital**: As the Treasury grows in size, yield generation may play an increasing role in covering DAO expenses. The long-term objective is for the Treasury to be able to partially or fully fund Balancer DAO’s operational needs through on-chain returns.\n\nThe Treasury is not expected to meet specific performance benchmarks or return targets at this time. Instead, strategic success is evaluated based on the alignment with DAO objectives, such as capital preservation, diversification, and liquidity readiness.\n\n### Risk Objectives\n\nRisk, in the context of this Investment Policy Statement, refers to the probability of the Treasury failing to meet its obligations, including operational funding needs, capital preservation, and strategic flexibility. The DAO maintains a conservative risk tolerance, placing high priority on capital preservation and steady operational continuity. ostracized strategies should avoid excessive volatility, capital loss, or dependence on speculative activity.\n\nThe following definitions and principles guide the risk management process:\n\n- **Risk Tolerance**: Balancer DAO has a conservative risk appetite. Risk-taking is acceptable only when aligned with the DAO’s core principles of sustainability, transparency, and control.\n- **Disallowed Activities**: Speculative trading or any activity with unacceptable downside risks is explicitly prohibited. Deployment is limited to strategies and venues deemed low-risk and pre-approved by governance.\n- **Risk Monitoring Categories**:\n  - **Market Risk**: Price volatility or macroeconomic trends affecting value.\n  - **Smart Contract Risk**: Vulnerabilities in protocol code.\n  - **Liquidity Risk**: Inability to convert assets quickly enough to meet operational needs.\n  - **Governance Risk**: Threats emerging from the governance processes of third-party protocols.\n  - **Operational Risk**: Execution errors, delays, or misalignments with DAO mandates.\n  - **Regulatory Risk**: Impact from evolving legal or compliance frameworks.\n\nThe Treasury Manager is expected to continuously monitor these risk vectors and maintain adequate tooling, alerting, and mitigation processes.\n\n## Investment Guidelines\n\nThe following investment guidelines are designed to ensure responsible treasury deployment, liquidity management, and operational flexibility. They reflect the DAO’s conservative risk profile and strategic intent to preserve capital while enabling stable, long-term financial sustainability.\n\n### Constraints\n\nThe Balancer DAO Treasury adheres to the following operational and risk-related constraints:\n\n- **Liquidity Target**: The Treasury aims to maintain a three-year stablecoin runway, structured across two liquidity tiers:\n  - 0–12 months: Stablecoins in highly liquid, instantly accessible venues.\n  - 12–36 months: Stablecoins deployed in longer-maturity strategies with conservative risk profiles.\n- **Deployment Limits**: To minimize protocol- or issuer-specific risk, each strategy or asset category (e.g., stablecoin deployments, ETH staking, or partner token allocations) should not allocate more than 30% of that category to a single protocol, platform, or asset.\n- **Strategy Restrictions**: Only low-risk, DAO-approved strategies may be used. Speculative trading or use of unvetted or high-risk protocols is prohibited. Strategies utilizing BAL or Balancer products require separate governance approval.\n- **Governance Permissions**: All actions must fall within the permissions framework pre-approved by the DAO via Roles Modifier contracts. Actions outside this allowlist are operationally blocked and cannot be executed by the Treasury Manager.\n\n## Asset Allocation\n\nThe Treasury may be allocated across a variety of assets and networks, with the following guiding rules:\n\n- **Approved Blockchains**:\n  - Ethereum Mainnet\n  - Gnosis Chain\n  - Arbitrum\n  - Base\n\n  Deployment to other chains requires DAO governance approval and creation of a new treasury address.\n\n- **Approved Strategy Types**:\n  - Lending and borrowing via DeFi money markets\n  - Liquidity provisioning\n  - Staking (direct or via liquid staking tokens)\n  - Cash-and-carry or basis trades without directional exposure\n  - Other strategies explicitly approved by the DAO via governance\n\n## Portfolio Rebalancing\n\n- **Rebalancing Frequency**: The Treasury will be rebalanced on a monthly basis by kpk to maintain liquidity targets and distribution alignment.\n- **Rebalancing Method**: Rebalancing transactions will be executed incrementally and in accordance with the DAO’s operational and risk constraints. Tranches, thresholds, or rotation schedules may be used based on market conditions.\n- **Initial Rebalancing**: Following IPS approval, the Treasury Manager may initiate a realignment of the portfolio to bring allocations closer to the defined liquidity targets and risk constraints, carried out with full transparency and subject to DAO oversight.\n\n## Treasury Expansion\n\nOver time, Balancer DAO may consider expanding its Treasury through new revenue sources, token conversions, or internal reallocation processes. While this IPS does not establish a fixed mechanism for treasury expansion, the following principles may guide future developments:\n\n- **Fee Integration**: The DAO may explore a model in which protocol revenues, including fees or emissions, are periodically transferred into the Treasury. This model could take inspiration from structures implemented by other DAOs, such as dYdX or ENS.\n- **Governance Approval Required**: Any expansion mechanism — whether recurring or one-time — must be proposed and approved through the DAO’s standard governance process. This includes setting thresholds, transfer schedules, and allocation destinations.\n- **Strategic Alignment**: Any treasury expansion should reinforce the DAO’s long-term sustainability, operational resilience, and financial autonomy. This includes strengthening the Treasury’s ability to fund DAO operations, support critical ecosystem functions, and increase capital flexibility.\n- **Implementation Scope**: Expansion activities may require technical and operational coordination between the Treasury Manager, DAO contributors, and core protocol entities (e.g., Balancer OpCo, Maxis). These interactions should be structured with transparency and accountability in mind.\n\n## Reporting and Performance Review\n\nTo ensure transparency and alignment with Balancer DAO’s objectives, the Treasury Manager will provide structured updates and facilitate community engagement through the following reporting mechanisms:\n\n1. **Monthly Treasury Reporting**: A monthly update will be published summarizing treasury composition, key activities, liquidity status, and any relevant strategic context. These reports may include charts, dashboards, and links to on-chain activity for verification.\n2. **Monthly Financial Reports**: kpk will deliver Financial Reports (formally known as “State of the DAO” presentations) that synthesize treasury insights with DAO-wide financial context, including budgeting, service provider tracking, and overall treasury health.\n3. **Quarterly Reviews**: Each quarter, a more in-depth assessment of treasury trends, strategic decisions, and market context will be shared. These reviews aim to support the DAO’s ability to steer financial planning and operational strategy.\n4. **Annual Reports**: Once per year, a comprehensive overview of the Treasury will be provided, covering liquidity runway, strategy effectiveness, risk exposures, and treasury structure. This will serve as a basis for governance reflection and potential IPS revisions.\n5. **Ad Hoc Updates and Permissions Changes**: Whenever a new strategy is proposed via a Permissions Update Request (PUR), an ad hoc update will be provided to the DAO. This includes strategy rationale, operational readiness, and risk considerations.\n6. **Evaluation Criteria**: Treasury performance will be assessed primarily against alignment with DAO objectives, including:\n   - Capital preservation\n   - Stable and diversified liquidity structure\n   - Operational readiness and risk mitigation\n   - Transparency in reporting and execution\n\nThe DAO reserves the right to reassess the Treasury Manager’s mandate at any time through its governance process, based on evolving priorities, ecosystem conditions, or organizational structure.",

        "author": "0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516",
        "body": "## Karpatkey Balancer Treasury CU Proposal\n\n## Background\n\nThis is a proposal to provide limited delegation of the Balancer treasury to [Karpatkey DAO](http://www.karpatkey.com) in a non-custodial, trust-minimised way.\n\nKarpatkey is a DeFi native DAO that has been constantly evolving to maximise capital efficiency, manage risk, increase security and optimise yield by combining industry-leading research with best-in-class tooling to prevent collateral liquidation. \n\nOur operation would be completely transparent at all times, and any member of Balancer DAO would be able to monitor it on-chain and through the weekly reports posted on the Balancer Forum. \\\nAlso, Karpatkey would suggest the creation of a Treasury Core Unit (CU) within Balancer DAO. If Balancer DAO approves this initiative, we would hire full time contributors to work exclusively with Balancer under our guidance and training. The scope of the CU would be determined after the assessment meetings where Karpatkey would find out Balancer’s needs. \\\nKarpatkey has been supporting Balancer since 2020, by being a top liquidity provider of ETH and stablecoins, and participating in governance, successfuly proposing a [GNO-BAL treasury swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/2110).\n\nAs a token of our long term commitment and financial alignment with Balancer, the performance fee (detailed below) would be charged in BAL and vested for 1 year. We intend to _hodl_ the collected BAL, and we would transparently report on our BAL holdings.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn order to focus on its core business, Balancer DAO must secure enough runway to keep developing its market-leading products, regardless of economic junctures. \\\nAn idle fund has a significant opportunity cost (e.g.: circa USD 120,000 a month for a $20M treasury at current market values). Therefore, delegating limited access of the treasury to a specialised DAO such as Karpatkey would optimise its growth through carefully curated and tailored strategies within a risk-controlled framework.\n\nThe chart below shows our past performance managing the treasury of our main user, GnosisDAO, when the main goal was to obtain a sustainable growth of funds with a low exposure to risk, before the focus was shifted to maximising the growth of the Gnosis Chain. As the chart illustrates, the yield obtained by Karpatkey’s strategies was greater than the yield of all the other DAOs in the ecosystem put together.\n\n![Karpatkey Participation Chart.jpg](ipfs://QmYtznUJRj7REvMnV2KgodwEiRTBDNB2b5mwLbgvBVRPgM)\nSource: [Autonolas](https://twitter.com/autonolas/status/1521853164638523397) independent research (link to original report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-3jTC3ycJYr2NzRFWeoQf4kb0EO2uMq/view))\n\n## Core Proposal\n### Trust-Minimised Fund Allocation Strategy\n\nThe process of fund allocation starts by Karpatkey DAO proposing a list of allowed protocols on Balancer DAO Snapshot, which must be approved by the majority of token holders. Once this happens, the target addresses and transactions’ call data associated with such protocols will be allowlisted in a smart contract, so that funds are always under Balancer DAO’s custody. As a result, Balancer DAO will have the power to withdraw or transfer funds without Karpatkey’s intervention.\n\nIf Balancer DAO has a specific need which wasn’t included in the approved strategy, such as incentives/rewards, payments, etc., Karpatkey would post another ad-hoc strategy including the additional services for Balancer DAO to approve. \\\nAn alternative would be to operate with trusted signers from Balancer, using the Safe multisignature wallet. Karpatkey would not hold enough signatures to be able to execute transactions on its own. Therefore, approval from Balancer signers would always be necessary.\n\nWe would put together a periodically reviewed emergency withdrawal protocol to be able to quickly derisk/liquidate/swap all positions in the event of a market crash, hack or any fortuitous event that requires to stop loss.\n\nKarpatkey DAO’s professional treasury development consists of carrying out tailored strategies that vary twice a week, adjusting to the constantly changing DeFi market.\n\n#### Daily Strategy Reevaluation \n\nEach step of the strategies would be designed and monitored daily by our research team, keeping in mind different risks and opportunities. \n\n#### Impermanent/Divergence Loss\n\nTo minimise the risk of Impermanent or Divergence Loss, we carry out the following tasks:\n\n* Identification of profitable and low IL pools (assessment of assets’ correlation evolution)\n* Definition of thresholds for exit strategies\n* Accurate IL tracking*, also considering different variations of deposited volumes  over time.\n\n*The way in which we calculate IL differs across protocols and specific cases within protocols, but it’s primordially based on the formula detailed below, which calculates the IL per LP token for any AMM with constant swap fees. Our Financial Engineering team is currently preparing a paper on  the equations that we use for IL calculation in different cases, encompassing single isolated financial positions and more complex positions including composability.\n\n### \n\n![IL Calculation.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifdeefejl4myrzqld2nzykkhg3yk6q2xrfwprumipk73hnz2r3ztq)\n\nImpermanent loss evolution tracking example:\n \n![IL Evolution.jpg](ipfs://bafkreihklmyqpr7qb72cct2it4jdvb442kvfjrcwd3o36gke33xhewzq5u)\n\n### Treasury Core Unit\n\nAfter reviewing Balancer DAO’s structure, we came to the conclusion that creating a Treasury Core Unit (CU) would increase the efficiency of the overall management of the tokens held in the treasury. If Balancer DAO agrees, this CU would be composed by full time contributors that would be sourced and recruited with Karpatkey DAO’s support. \\\nThe CU members would be trained and assisted by Karpatkey DAO, observing strict security standards. They could be on Karpatkey DAO’s payroll and would be in charge of the following tasks (among others):\n\n\n\n* **Balancer Value Proposition:** Improve the value proposition of Balancer and the Balancer DAO treasury\n* **Availability:** Increase Balancer availability on other networks and markets\n* **Liquidity:** Increasing Balancer liquidity so more traders and investors can acquire it with a lower price impact\n* **Balancer Health Monitoring:** Propose buybacks if we consider Balancer is undervalued\n* **Fund Proposals:** Any proposal involving funding will be comprehensively analysed by the CU to plan how token transfers should take place in a timeline, and ensure that liquidity requirements are met and executed properly\n* **Fund OPEX:** All of Balancer DAO’s operating expenses will be analysed and projected to meet liquidity requirements and make timely transfers if needed\n* **Drafting and Maintenance of an Emergency Token Withdrawal Protocol:** In case of a sudden black swan market event, the team will execute a carefully structured protocol to de-risk all positions and avoid losing funds. This protocol will be periodically updated to ensure it’s ready to be executed at all times\n* **Capital Optimisation:** CDPs will be continuously monitored and managed to prevent liquidation (more details in the Risk Management section below)\n* **Reporting:** Dashboard creation and maintenance to monitor the yield of investments, rewards distribution and overall treasury growth trend, health and diversification\n* **Bridge Monitoring:** analysis of funds allocation to allow the Balancer token to be transferred across networks without friction.\n\n### Yield Strategy\n\nThe yield strategy would vary weekly to keep it within target. It would resort to different combinations of staking derivatives solutions, AMM, same asset leveraged in money markets, carry trade, arbitrages, etc. Given the risk that it entails, we don’t do trading.\n\nIn alignment with Balancer’s treasury allocation policy, the strategy would not extract  value from directly competing protocols. The following protocols would be considered to obtain an adequately diversified yield strategy with low risk and reduced ETH price exposure. This is just a sample list, the final one would follow Balancer DAO’s preferences and risk profile:\n\nAave, Agave, Ankr, Aura, Balancer, Bancor, Compound, Element, Honeyswap, Idle, Lido, Liquity, Maker, Nexus Mutual, QiDAO, Reflexer, Rocket pool, Stakewise, Sushiswap, Swapr, Symmetric, Synthetix, Uniswap, Unit.\n\n### Reporting\n\nKarpatkey DAO will post a weekly treasury development report on the Balancer forum, and support in identifying data elements upon request from the Balancer community. Also, Karpatkey DAO would review data reported and assist in performing analytics and quality reviews to confirm the accuracy of the information.\n\nThe following metrics would be included:\n\n* **Portfolio Summary:** shows the current holdings in USD and ETH equivalent, considering the allocation by blockchain, as well as the allocation of the most relevant assets\n* **Revenues:** shows the performance of the portfolio strategy, displaying the current APR, annual revenues, capital utilisation and past performance\n* **Positions:** shows the complete strategy implemented for the considered time period, explaining the type of investments, protocols, underlying assets, expected APR and expected revenues\n* **Loans Management:** shows the loan strategy to quickly assess the health status of the active loans, considering the borrowed assets and funds, the lent assets and funds, the collateral ratio and the minimum (liquidation) collateral ratio\n* **Portfolio details:** shows the complete composition of the portfolio by type of asset\n* **Improvement Proposals:** shows the list of executed proposals, as well as a summary of the weight of each proposal\n* **Incentives program:** shows the incentives strategy, displaying the amount of assets used on each protocol.\n\n### Fees\n\nKarpatkey DAO will charge the following fees, which have been adjusted to make this proposal self-financing, without burdening Balancer DAO’s growth:\n\n#### Management fee\n\nA yearly management fee (in monthly instalments) of 0.5% of the AUM would be charged to finance fixed costs like hiring full time contributors to Balancer DAO.\n\n#### Performance fee\n\nWe’d charge a monthly performance fee of 20% of the yield obtained during the last month in BAL tokens, and every payment will have a vesting period of 1 year. We intend to hold it long term, as a token of our commitment to Balancer.\n\n### Termination\n\nBalancer may terminate Karpatkey DAO’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of Governance Mechanism. Kapatkey DAO may terminate this agreement upon four week’s notice posted as a new discussion thread in the Balancer forum. In case the termination is requested by Balancer without at least a 4 week notice, Karpatkey DAO will be granted an exit fee equal to the fees collected during the last 2 months, which will be paid in ETH. Regular fees will be collected until the day of termination.\n\n\n### Custody of Funds\n\nKarpatkey DAO is not a custodian of funds. The funds will be in possession of authorised signers of Balancer at all times. Karpatkey DAO will sign transactions using two addresses, which won’t suffice to execute transactions.\n\nKarpatkey DAO is not responsible for the loss of funds caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies with smart contracts or protocols which are not owned by Balancer or Karpatkey DAO.\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion by Balancer and may need to be (re)structured to take account of legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, Karpatkey DAO would post a yield strategy in Balancer’s Snapshot, holding a broad list of protocol options without granular specification of parameters nor exact moment when transactions would be executed. We would then operate within those boundaries, without having to go through a DAO-wide vote on every trade, while ensuring that only transactions approved by Balancer DAO could be carried out by Karpatkey DAO. \\\nAlternatively, at least one trusted signer should be appointed by Balancer to approve each transaction. This could be a member of the Treasury Core Unit.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Risk Management\n\nEvery decision made and action taken weighs in risk exposure. Most large treasury holders have one thing in common: risk aversion. At Karpatkey DAO, we go above and beyond standard risk assessment protocols, and we have developed a multilevel approach to curate yield strategies, assess protocols and carry out transactions safely.\n\n(see the full list of risk factors in the forum post due to max char. limit for Snapshot)",

        "body": "Co-Authors: Zen Dragon & Lipman with the support of the Balancer Maxis\nFee Processing & Automation Owners: Xeonus and Gosuto\n\n### Summary & Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to align key partners in the Balancer ecosystem with the tokenomic model of veBAL. By doing so, liquidity providers and partners equally benefit by their liquidity in Balancer pools and prioritizing Balancer over competing DEXs. In short, the way to further align all parties leveraging the Balancer DEX is to share a portion of the revenue generated by their pools with them; in the form of USDC to be converted to veBAL.\n\nIn doing so, partners such as Aave, Lido, and Rocketpool will be actively building a veBAL position to incentivize their pools long term, while collecting passive income on their position. This mechanism not only acts as a pseudo-buy back of BAL in the form of the 8020 pool tokens, but it also incentivizes and exposes partners to participate in veBAL further. Thus maintaining their relationship and usage with Balancer not only for the cutting edge features on Balancer V3, and historic depth on V2, but because they receive economic benefits for doing so.\n\nBased on [BIP-734](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-734-balancer-v3-launch-and-protocol-enhancements/6168), the split of the 50% protocol fee on swaps and 10% protocol fee on yields would act as follows under this new arrangement:\n\nFor core pools (wstETH/wETH or rETH/wETH for example), of all fees collected:\n\n* 12.5% continues to flows passively to veBAL holders\n* 52.5% (instead of 70%) of revenue would be recycled as bribes\n* 17.5% is directed to the multisig designated by a partner protocol in the form of USDC to be converted to veBAL\n* 17.5% is sent to the Balancer DAO\n\nFor non-core pools (80AAVE/20wstETH for example) of all fees collected:\n\n* 65% (instead of 82.5%) of revenue flows to veBAL holders as passive income\n* 17.5% is directed to the multisig designated by a partner protocol in the form of USDC to be converted to veBAL\n* 17.5% is sent to the Balancer DAO\n\nIn the sections below details regarding qualifications, the automation process, monitoring, and time commitments are outlined to define in greater detail the proposed rules of this program.\n\n**Execution Specification**\n\nIn order to execute this proposal, the fee processing logic built for Balancer V2 and Balancer V3 must be modified to redirect the proposed portion of fees defined above to the addresses presented by each qualifying partner protocol. The V2 portion, due to being built for over a year, is far more configurable and trusted, making the phase one roll out of this program possible for V2 within 4 weeks of this proposal passing. To respect the framework laid out by [BIP-734](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-734-balancer-v3-launch-and-protocol-enhancements/6168), this proposal will only go live after the first enactment of a Balancer Alliance member is passed by governance. In turn the non-core to core recycling portion of Balancer V2 would end as stated in the mentioned enhancement proposal. Balancer V3 core pool recycling would still potentially not occur for 1-2 more rounds, making the rollout of both fee model formats occur progressively.\n\nThe estimated lead time upon passing this proposal is after 2 epochs of successful fee processing for Balance V3 before the first Balancer Alliance fee processing round to occur. During this time period qualifying protocols would be invited to propose becoming Alliance members on the forum based on their history on Balancer. These proposals will be considered primarily in terms of time weighted TVL and revenue generating benchmarks, coupled with an outlined incentive structure from the corresponding partner to justify the flagging of new or existing pools to be deemed as eligible for revenue sharing.\n\n**Qualification**\n\nPartners that have generated $1M or more in lifetime protocol fees are deemed (‘Eligible Partners’). We believe these protocols have historically contributed a meaningful positive impact to Balancer and should automatically qualify for this program as a result. The following protocols would meet this criteria per this [query](https://dune.com/queries/4746663):\n\nTop Performers\n\n* AAVE\n* Lido\n* Rocketpool\n* Radiant\n* Renzo\n\nPotential Alliance Members\n\n* EtherFi\n* Gnosis \n* Others if a compelling proposal is made to the DAO\n\n***How it works***\n\nThere are two categories of Eligible Partners:\n\n1. Eligible Partners with individual pool(s) that generated >$1m in lifetime protocol fees (‘E1 Partners’)\n\n2. Eligible Partners without individual pool(s) that have generated >$1m in protocol fees - but the sum of lifetime protocol fees across all pools is >$1m (‘E2 Partners’)\n\nE1 Partners would automatically receive the 17.5% fee sharing on the existing pools that have generated >$1M in lifetime protocol fees (‘Grandfathered Pool’). E1 Partners would also be eligible to receive the 17.5% on future pools if additional certain criteria are met (more below).\n\nGrandfathered Pools include:\n\n* Aave-wstETH\n* wstETH-wETH\n* rETH-wETH\n* ezETH-wETH\n* RDNT-wETH\n\nE2 Partners would not automatically earn the 17.5% fee share on any existing pools. They can earn 17.5% on existing or future pools if certain criteria is met (more below).\n\n***Criteria to earn Fee Share***\n\nFor clarity, this section excludes Grandfathered Pools.\n\nThe following criteria must be met in order to receive the 17.5% fee:\n\n* Must be an Eligible Partner\n* Pools must be a core pool\n* Pools can only have Balancer protocol fees associated with it (e.g. cannot be a Gyro pool, etc.)\n* Eligible Partner must bribe an amount on Aura for the pool in order to maintain alignment between ecosystem participants. This results in Aura holders maintaining at least status quo (likely better) even with the fee sharing.\n  * At a minimum partner pools must target a $5M TVL and utilize 1,000 USD worth of incentives per week to bootstrap pools from 0 to this point. Only at the point of hitting $5M in TVL is a pool eligible for the fees to be redirected towards accumulating veBAL for the partner.\n  * The recommended incentive structure for partners would vary depending on the token, network, and various other factors. The suggested incentive format would entail a 3 month program at a minimum, however larger packages over a short period of time should also be considered by the DAO.\n    * This point is only a recommendation, ultimately the DAO determines which partners proposal do or do not qualify for this program.\n* Must continue to permalock their veBAL\n\nIf an Eligible Partner stops meeting these criteria, then the 17.5% fee sharing will terminate.\n\n**Automation and Processing**\n\nUpon the confirmation of a Balancer Alliance member's proposal to join the program, a flag will be set in the fee processing automation for the pools included in their respective proposal. This flag will indicate the pool is actively claimed by a partner, and indicate the address in which the USDC tokens should be sent. Depending upon if the pool is on Balancer V2 or V3, the fee processing automation repo will be adjusted respectively. All funds are processed on L2s and Mainnet will be converted to USDC, consolidated to the mainnet fee processing multisig, and the respective portion of USDC will be sent to the partner multisig, which will purchase 8020 BPT, lock the tokens, and manage the position accordingly.\n\nIf the partner fails to continue to relock the veBAL position, and or does not deliver on their agreed-upon incentive package the flag can be terminated at the discretion of the Balancer Maxis without a DAO via a governance vote. If desired, any community member is capable of putting up a proposal to end a partner's alliance program eligibility for the DAO to vote upon.\n\n**Monitoring and Regulation**\n\nThe Balancer Maxis, the operations and business development arm of the DAO, will take responsibility for monitoring the behavior of each Balancer Alliance member in terms of their veBAL locking activity and delivering on their incentive strategies to each respective pool. This will be done manually via on chain spot checks given the likelihood of only 3-5 participants in the near term. If the program does expand greatly, automation will be considered as needed.\n\nTo regulate gamification or abuse of the program, partner mutlisigs will be monitored to confirm locking of freshly acquired pool tokens occurs on at least a monthly basis. The Maxis will issue a notification to respective partners if the deadline is missed. The Maxis reserve the right, without a governance proposal, to terminate the fee sharing agreement if a lock is not executed for a 8 week period. A similar precedent will be held for the incentive commitments in the partner proposals, if an incentive program is not delivered upon for 2 weeks, a notification will be sent to the partner, with a proposal to pause revenue sharing being vindicated after 4 weeks.\n\n**Lido Case Study**\n\nUsing Lido’s [wstETH-wETH](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x93d199263632a4ef4bb438f1feb99e57b4b5f0bd0000000000000000000005c2) mainnet pool as an example, Lido would have earned roughly $120k worth of veBAL over the last twelve months as a result of the proposed 17.5% fee share. When also considering the emissions they would have commanded and the veBAL fees they would have received, the total value of the $120k veBAL position would have been ~$138k. Please note: the TVL of this pool has varied significantly over the past 12 months due to migrations (e.g. TVL of $10m vs. $40m today). If TVL continues to grow, such as when the pool was ~$150m in the past, we’d expect the fee sharing to also grow accordingly.\n\nThe $120,000 redirected away from LPs due to this program would need to be offset by Lido through roughly $84,000 in bribes on Aura (see calculation below).\n\nThe following analysis uses data from this [Dune](https://dune.com/queries/4746791/7888262). The data can also be found in this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m7Npwr0eEJcao5G1-JbALIJYZ7fMtSFTOYOGnOXJtpE/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n|Component|Calculation|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Pool’s Total Monthly Incentives|Average of last 3 months|40,000 USD|\n|Fee Sharing: veBAL Purchase|17.5% of Pool’s Revenue|(10,000 USD)|\n|Remaining Incentives After veBAL Purchase|40,000 - 10,000|30,000 USD|\n|Incentive Reallocation|||\n|- 70% to LPs already going to vlAURA|30,000 × 70%|21,000 USD|\n|- 30% shifted from veBAL bribes to vlAURA bribes|30,000 × 30%|9,000 USD|\n|vlAURA Efficiency Gain*|9,000 × (1/0.75)|3,000 USD|\n|Net LP Incentives|21,000 + 12,000|33,000 USD|\n|Gross Partner Costs|||\n|- Monthly incentive budget necessary to make up for LP deficit|40,000 - 33,000|7,000 USD|\n|Additional Revenue Streams|||\n|- Monthly veBAL vote rewards|Based on the average of the last twelve months, assuming the fee share program was in place.|$1,075|\n|- Monthly passive veBAL revenue|11% return on locked position|$1,100|\n|Monthly Net Partner Cost|7,000 - 1,075 - 1,100|4,825 USD|\n|Annualized Impact|||\n|Total Partner veBAL position||$120,000|\n|Total Net Partner Cost||$57,900|\n|Total Net Partner Benefit||$62,100|\n|Net Partner Passive Benefits for Year 2 if fully locked|Passive yield $1,100 x 12 veBAL incentives control $1,075 x 12|$13,200/yr $12,900/yr| \n\n**Aura Efficiency Consideration**\n\nAs mentioned above, in order to bridge the gap of any incentives forfeited by liquidity providers, Balancer will redirect 100% of core pool revenue for these pools to vlAura bribes. Due to the state of the voting market, Aura is smoother in terms of returns and predictable outcomes. Making the ROI roughly 1.3x compared to a veBAL bribe. While all other core pools will continue to respect the split based on Auras veBAL share, these pools will receive the \"optimal\" revenue redirection strategy. Per Rocketpool [tracking reference](https://discord.com/channels/@me/1300649462343139338/1349909682294358106).\n\n![BIP-812-1.png](ipfs://bafkreidulwnpjtbzzd6ez4funkc7i6bzdwnxg4vw6gx3ajyyuv4pjmy4lu)\n\n**Timelines**\n\nProposal to be discussed on forum for 2 weeks due it’s magnitude. Based on today's post date of Tuesday March 25th, the vote round of April 10th, 2025 would be when this proposal is eligible for a snapshot vote.\n\nAssuming the proposal passes, any teams interested in proposing to join the Balancer Alliance would post to the forum any time after this snapshot vote concludes. Each proposal is recommended to sit on the forum allowing discussion regarding included pools and incentive plans, for one full week prior to being sent to a formal snapshot vote.\n\nAfter passing a vote, the partner is not eligible for fee sharing until the following fee round is processed. A partner is not eligible for the fees being collected during their proposal discussion and voting period.\n\nThe Balancer Maxis are expected to have to have automation in place for this form of recycling to occur no later than after 2 successful fee processing epochs on V3. Timelines regarding the automated monitoring are to follow upon further evaluation of the scale and overhead this imposes manually.\n\n**Cold Start Initiative**\n\nDue to the nature of veBAL, there is a barrier for entry to begin participating in the system where voting relative to incentives controlled, revenue generated, and gas costs of operating the position do not make economic sense. In order to combat this, and give partners a warm start on their veBAL participation experience, this proposal invites each Balancer Alliance member to include a request for up to 10,000 USD worth of BAL to be given to them by the Balancer DAO in the form of a loan. The BAL is to be matched with wETH from their treasury and locked as a kickstart to their governance holdings. If a partner ever unwinds their veBAL position, they must commit to returning the BAL equivalent to the Balancer DAO.\n\nEligibility is subject to evaluation for each project, which will be outlined in each partner's respective proposal. Committed partners with unwavering commitment to utilizing Balancer as their core DEX would be candidates for this allocation. All proposing alliance members are welcome to present their historic commitment to compel the DAO to loan this BAL as a value add.\n\n**Partner Proposal Requirements and Proposal Guidelines**\n\n* Require a Gnosis Safe or Smart Contract\n  * Must be whitelisted to lock veBAL, this is a payload attached to each Balancer Alliance Member proposal.\n* Must include proposed incentive package in terms of token, amounts per round, number of rounds, and net goal in TVL leveraging calculations around the prior values.\n\n**Disclaimers**\n\n1. The data related to economic performance of veBAL, like any investment, cannot be held to the account that prior returns are indicative of future performance.\n\n2. No forum post or proposal is necessary for the Balancer Maxis to act on behalf of the DAO when ending a program or portion of the program based on partners not meeting the outlined criteria above. For example, if proposed incentives are not delivered or veBAL is not re-locked by a partner, Maxis reserves the right to turn off the revenue sharing flag. This action would require a public post to the forum with motivation and supporting data only.\n\n3. If two members wish to join the Balancer Alliance Program claiming rights to the same pool, this is not in the scope of the Balancer Maxi automation infrastructure. For example if Renzo and Lido over a wstETH-ezETH pair. The first partner to lay claim, with the voted and approved incentive package by the DAO must honor this vote. To transition a pool revenue share from one partner to another would require a governance vote and thorough discussion with all relevant parties on the forum.\n\n4. Any revenue split amongst alliance members must be handled between their teams. The Balancer Maxis will not support splitting revenue of one pool amongst more than one partner address.",

        "author": "0xafFC70b81D54F229A5F50ec07e2c76D2AAAD07Ae",
        "body": "This proposal appears on [Balancer's forum](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/decide-on-gauge-unexpected-behavior/2960).\n\n# Introduction\n\nOn Monday afternoon, during a knowledge-sharing session between Balancer Labs's engineers, we realized that the veCRV smart contracts that form the basis of the veBAL system operate differently from our initial expectations.\n\nNo user funds are at stake, nor is any immediate action from Liquidity Providers required. The veBAL contract also remains safe and will continue to allow current and future holders to vote on the allocation of weekly BAL emissions for Balancer pools.\n\nOur initial understanding was that the gauge type weights (`_get_type_weight`) in the Gauge Controller contract would allow us to implement classes of gauges, such that the share of emissions directed to each class (a \"gauge type\") would be controlled by Balancer governance (see the Gauge types section of the veBAL Tokenomics proposal[[1]](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x9fe19c491cf90ed2e3ed9c15761c43d39fd1fb732a940aba8058ff69787ee90a)).\n\nThe intended outcome was for BAL emissions to be allocated as follows:\n\n* 10% to veBAL holders\n* 56% to Ethereum Pools\n* 7% to Arbitrum Pools\n* 17% to Polygon Pools\n* 10% to the Liquidity Mining Committee, for partnerships\n\nveBAL holders would then vote on-chain on how to distribute the 56/17/7% allocations among Liquidity Pools in those networks.\n\nIn reality, such implementation is not possible in the original veCRV system. Implementing this would require substantially changing the system, reducing compatibility with apps built on top of Curve's ecosystem - one of the key expected benefits outlined in the veBAL proposal.\n\nWhat this means for the veBAL system as currently deployed is that:\n\n1. mainnet gauges have been minting ~100% of weekly emissions instead of 56%; and\n2. contrary to our original intent/expectations, no other gauges will be able to mint any significant amounts of BAL on April 14th.\n\nWe'll be conducting a thorough post-mortem to identify what we could have done differently, and make changes to our internal processes so as to prevent this from happening again. In the meantime, the Balancer community must now make a decision.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal provides two options below for how governance can proceed. In both options the LM committee is proposed to be eliminated as everyone showed support for this (even the LM committee itself). \n\n## Option 1: keep the system as it is\n\nThis means that through the on-chain gauge voting mechanism, veBAL holders have full control over the allocation of weekly BAL emissions. Gauges would be created so that veBAL holders would be able to direct incentives to themselves (that is, to all veBAL holders) or to pools on Polygon and Arbitrum, in addition to the existing gauges on Ethereum mainnet.\n\nA 10% cap would be imposed on weekly emissions to veBAL holders, with any excess being sent to the Balancer DAO treasury.\n\n### Pros:\n\n* No redeployment or migration necessary: LPs wouldn't have to take any action.\n* The system would become more similar to Curve's, which has no weekly allocation to veCRV holders. Balancer would still have this options available, but the amount would be defined directly by veBAL voting (up to the 10% cap) instead of being fixed at 10% as initially proposed.\n\n### Cons / Risks:\n\n* The original fixed weight distribution to veBAL holders won't be possible. It will still be possible to achieve this through veBAL votes, but the outcome would no longer be predictable. The veBAL gauge may get less than 10% of the votes, leading to fewer tokens being allocated to veBAL holders, or more than 10%, reducing the size of liquidity incentives for Pools (funding the DAO treasury in the process).\n\n## Option 2: deploy a new version of the gauge system\n\nThis is the closest we can get to a system that behaves as described in the veBAL proposal without significant changes to the veCRV system.\n\n1. The current BAL Minter contract would have its minting permission revoked.\n2. Three new BAL Minter contracts would be deployed, enforcing that 10% of emissions are allocated to veBAL holders, and 90% are controlled by veBAL holders through the on-chain gauge voting mechanism.\n3. A new GaugeController and a new GaugeFactory for mainnet pools would be deployed.\n4. The existing veBAL contract would have voting power over this new GaugeController: no migration is needed on the part of veBAL holders.\n\nIt would still not be possible to implement the 56/17/7% split between mainnet/Polygon/Arbitrum as outlined in the veBAL proposal. The distribution across the 3 networks (and any additional network Balancer may be deployed to in the future) will be fully defined by veBAL voting power (this is also true in option 1).\n\n### Pros:\n\n* The original fixed allocation to veBAL holders in the veBAL proposal would be achieved: veBAL holders would get 10% of weekly emissions.\n\n### Cons / Risks:\n\n* This will require a migration of staking positions. New gauges would be deployed on mainnet to replace the existing ones. Liquidity providers would be required to unstake from the current gauges and stake into the new ones in order to continue to receive incentives (as part of this proposal, the Balancer treasury would reimburse the gas costs of these operations).\nLiquidity providers that don’t migrate before a transition period finishes would not get BAL until they do so.\n* Current votes would be lost and veBAL holders would have to recast their votes to mainnet gauges (the impact of this could be low, assuming most would recast anyway when L2 gauges were to be released).\n* The gauge for the wstETH/WETH pool is also receiving LDO on top of BAL from the veBAL program. As LPs unstake from this gauge to stake in the new one, they would lose any potential LDO for the remainder of the week.\n\nAn airdrop of BAL through a Merkle Orchard (the legacy LM distribution system) would happen for those who did not claim their BAL from LM in the current system before the migration, along with a reimbursement for migration gas costs. LPs that migrate to the new gauges will be accounted for as if they had not unstaked from the current gauges.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe governance multisig needs to call the authorizer[[2]](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa331d84ec860bf466b4cdccfb4ac09a1b43f3ae6#code) with the following inputs: `authorizer.grantRole(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, coordinator)` , which means it will grant full admin powers to the coordinator smart contract.\n\nSince the coordinator hasn’t been deployed yet, its address is not known. However, the Balancer community will be able to verify the coordinator address by that date on Balancer’s github in the deployment output folder[[3]](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/deployments/tasks/20220418-veBAL-gauge-fix-coordinator/output/mainnet.json). This link will point to a json file with entry `veBALGaugeFixCoordinator` followed by the coordinator’s address on mainnet:\n`{   veBALGaugeFixCoordinator: 0xabced...., }`\n\nAfter applying the necessary changes voted, the coordinator will renounce all given permissions and will not be usable anymore.\n\n## Coordinator Actions\n\nThe actions to be performed by the coordinator depend on the option chosen by the community.\n\n### Option 1\n\nThe coordinator will mint the missing 98.6k BAL meant for veBAL holders, as well as Polygon and Arbitrum LPs. These tokens will be sent to the recipient contracts of the gauges, resulting in the same outcome as if the gauges had minted the tokens.\n\nThen, the gauge type weights for all types will be set to the same value, making votes for all gauge types have the same relative weight. veBAL holders will need to vote for the veBAL gauge in order for it to receive tokens.\n\nThe coordinator will also set the gauge type weight for the Liquidity Mining Commmittee type to 0 and kill the gauge.\n\n### Option 2\n\nThe coordinator will mint the missing 98.6k BAL meant for veBAL holders, as well as Polygon and Arbitrum LPs. These tokens will be sent to the recipient contracts of the gauges, resulting in the same outcome as if the gauges had minted the tokens. \n\nAdditionally, it will mint all unminted BAL tokens that correspond to L1 LPs in order to airdrop them as part of the migration. Then, it will revoke minting permission from the current Balancer Minter contract, effectively disabling the Liquidity Mining program in its current configuration and preventing any further minting from the existing gauges.\n\nWith the old minter contract disabled, it will grant minting permissions to three new contracts: one that will always mint 10% of weekly emissions for veBAL holders, one that will always mint 10% of weekly emissions for the Liquidity Mining Committee (unless the community decides to not continue with this initiative), and one that will distribute the remaining percentage to liquidity gauges. A new GaugeController will be connected to this minter, meaning veBAL holders will need to recast their votes, and new liquidity gauges will in turn be connected to the GaugeController, meaning LPs will need to unstake from the old gauges and stake in the new one (this gas cost would be later reimbursed).\n\nThe coordinator will also set the gauge type weight for the Liquidity Mining Commmittee type to 0 and kill the gauge.\n\n## Keeping promises\n\nLiquidity providers on Polygon and Arbitrum have been expecting to receive 24650 BAL and 10150 BAL per week for liquidity provided between April 4 and April 17. Similarly, veBAL holders have been expecting 14500 BAL per week starting on April 7.\n\nUntil this proposal has been discussed and voted on, those amounts would be honored. Governance would mint 98.6k BAL to be retroactively distributed to veBAL holders and liquidity providers on Polygon and Arbitrum, covering the period between April 4th and April 21st.\n\nNo minting would be required to cover the Liquidity Mining Committee's share of emissions for the week between April 7 and April 13, as no commitments were made regarding distributions for that week. If needed, 14.5k BAL could be minted if there's a need to allocate BAL through the committee for the week between April 14 and April 20, but given that a gauge migration is one of the possible outcomes of this proposal it would be best to avoid allocating additional reward tokens to the existing gauges.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [Introducing veBAL Tokenomics](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x9fe19c491cf90ed2e3ed9c15761c43d39fd1fb732a940aba8058ff69787ee90a)",
