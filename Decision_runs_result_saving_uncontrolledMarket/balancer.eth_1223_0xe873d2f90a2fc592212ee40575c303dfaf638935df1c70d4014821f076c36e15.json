The first lock of 1.42m AURA will expire and can be relocked after March 7th and before the unlolck date of March 14th, 2024:\n\n \n![bip-551.png](ipfs://bafkreigqscbntq3fhxjxnaicwwfro3tn7zzntkhpp4ecec25bd7c5z3bfi)\n    \n\nThe DAO wishes to relock its current position and bundle it with an additional vest so the next unlock is bundled into one in 16 weeks from the relock date.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Balancer DAO wishes to relock its vlAURA position to continue to vote for Balancer gauges with its position. To do so the DAO needs to relock its expired position timely after March 7th and before March 14th 2024\n\nAt the time of writing, the DAO is entitled again to roughly ~280k AURA tokens (can be verified by calling `available` with `_recipient` as `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` https://etherscan.io/address/0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422 ). Another ~297k AURA remains unvested and will be claimed at a later date.\n\nWe are proposing to initiate another lock with the available ~280k AURA to be used to vote on AURA governance. The specifics of the Balancer DAOs voting allocations can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419).\n\nBy re-locking the initial position and vesting additional AURA between March 7th and March 14th which would fall into the same locking epoch, it is guaranteed that the entirety of the locks will be up for re-lock in 16 weeks, reducing load on the multi-sig, streamlining the management of this position.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the vlAURA contract at `0x3fa73f1e5d8a792c80f426fc8f84fbf7ce9bbcac` and call `processExpiredLocks` with argument `true` - The execution needs to be timed AFTER March 7th and BEFORE March 14th\n\nAdditionally, the DAO multisig on mainnet `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will call the `claim` function on the AuraVestedEscrow at `0xfd72170339ac6d7bdda09d1eaca346b21a30d422` with the parameter `_lock` set to `true`. This execution, as well as the above, needs to be timed AFTER March 7th and BEFORE March 14th",

        "body": "Payload with PR:\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1420\n\n# Background\n\nThe DAO claimed its AURA allocation and locked it in [BIP-481](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-481-claim-and-lock-balancer-dao-aura-allocation-into-vlaura/5319), and later more claiming/locking occurred via [BIP-551](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-551-claim-and-relock-balancer-daos-aura-vlaura/5588) and [BIP-638](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-638-claim-and-relock-balancer-daos-additional-aura-vlaura/5811). As a result the DAO multisig now has 2m vlAURA, which will become available to be relocked `2024-10-17 00:00UTC` and will otherwise unlock `2024-10-24 00:00UTC`.\n\nThe voting power is actively being used strategically every epoch, and the DAO would like to keep doing so. Therefore, in order to (1) prevent having to create a new BIP for every relock, and to (2) reduce the risk of the DAO multisig not being able to execute this relocking every cycle within the right time window, we developed a Safe module that does this automatically: [`AuraLockerModule.sol`](https://github.com/onchainification/aura_locker_v2/blob/main/src/AuraLockerModule.sol).\n \n![99c62e3a1b141e4650ec239242ef693d3ad5acce.png](ipfs://bafkreiadk3sqmjsnpbwggqpx57ljurxvt5t5ze5jpuzjytwknlhyrgikiq)\n    \n# Summary\n\nThe proposal here is to enable this module on the DAO multisig, and to thus let the module, on behalf of the DAO multisig, relock all vlAURA automatically every cycle as soon as that becomes possible. If this were to for some reason fail, the DAO multisig will have the mandate to relock manually every cycle. The module can be disabled at any time to prevent relocking from occurring, if the DAO were to have other plans with its AURA allocation.\n\n# Risks\n\nA variant of the same contract by the same author has been [running in production](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC485aFD2f3252cCB69d1c94392701d51013D42eB) successfully for a different DAO. [This Dune query](https://dune.com/queries/4143358) shows all of its successful automatic relocking events (note how almost all of them occur at the first block at midnight UTC). Besides Maxi’s internal reviews, a Balancer Labs contributor (@mkflow27) did a review of the contract. If the module fails to perform its task, the DAO multisig still has 7 days to relock via a manual call (`0x3Fa73f1E5d8A792C80F426fc8F84FBF7Ce9bBCAC.processExpiredUnlocks(true)`).\n\n# Payload\n\nDAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` on Ethereum will call `enableModule(0xfD20C63554A9916816dC5e5Df596A0333185F263)` on itself.",
