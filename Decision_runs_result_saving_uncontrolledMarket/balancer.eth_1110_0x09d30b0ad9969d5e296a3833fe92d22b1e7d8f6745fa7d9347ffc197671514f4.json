Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by centralized reserves, USDN employs a delta-neutral strategy through a structured product mechanism. This approach balances long and short positions within the protocol to stabilize USDN's value and generate returns for participants.\n\nKey features of USDN include:\n\n- **Decentralization**: Operates entirely on-chain without reliance on centralized entities.\n- **Yield Generation**: Utilizes a rebase mechanism to distribute yields directly to holders' wallets.\n- **Delta-Neutral Strategy**: Maintains stability by balancing leveraged long positions against the vault's holdings.\n- **No Custodial Risk**: Users interact directly with smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral).\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntegrating USDN with aGHO in a Balancer v3 Composable Stable pool offers several advantages:\n\n- **Enhanced Capital Efficiency**: aGHO, being GHO deposited into Aave's Prime instance, accrues native yield, reducing the need for additional incentives.\n- **Strengthened Liquidity**: Establishes a primary liquidity venue for USDN, promoting seamless integrations with DeFi protocols utilizing aGHO.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader integrations across DeFi for USDN.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nSmarDex uses \"Privileged functions\" which allow Multisigs to have an overview about all important functions of the protocol. \n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nThe USDN protocol relies on a dual-oracle system, utilizing both Pyth and Chainlink, to obtain accurate price feeds. This redundancy ensures resilience against potential oracle failures and maintains the integrity of the protocol's operations.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nSmarDex's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [SmarDex Documentation](https://docs.smardex.io/ultimate-synthetic-delta-neutral/risks).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nThere is no governance; the team manages all operations. Some contracts are renounced, while others are controlled by a 3/5 multisig\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nAs a new Balancer v3 pool, the USDN/aGHO pair aims to establish itself as a significant liquidity venue for USDN. The integration with Aave's aGHO token is expected to enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **USDN/aGHO** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for USDN, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize GHO. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and expanding USDN's utility across the Ethereum ecosystem. With GHO being the cornerstone asset for swap in Balancer v3 it will ensure efficient swap throughout the DEX.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: 0x950682e741abd1498347a93b942463af4ec7132b\n- Gauge: 0x9798995a042973d9705a4f0fea691a4541d13b43\n- GaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

The protocol employs a dual-token system comprising USDf and sUSDf, where USDf serves as the foundational unit of account, and sUSDf is a yield-bearing token obtained by staking USDf.\n\nUSDf maintains its peg through a combination of delta-neutral trading strategies and cross-market arbitrage opportunities, ensuring stability even during market turbulence. The protocol supports multiple minting mechanisms, including Classic Mint and Innovative Mint, catering to various user risk profiles and strategies.\n\nFalcon Finance operates with a focus on sustainable yield generation, making it a robust solution for users seeking stable, on-chain liquidity without relinquishing exposure to their underlying assets.\n\nFor more details, see the [Falcon Finance Documentation](https://docs.falcon.finance/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning to a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool for USDf/aGHO will significantly enhance capital efficiency and yield opportunities for liquidity providers. The integration of aGHO, which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and provides additional yield streams.\n\nThe new **USDf/aGHO** pool will serve as the primary liquidity venue for USDf on Balancer, facilitating seamless integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aGHO. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users interacting with Aave-based strategies.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, encourage liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for USDf, solidifying its role within the synthetic dollar ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nFalcon Finance's governance framework is designed to ensure transparency and community involvement. While TGE has not happened yet, the core team is shipping fast and efficiently at the moment and will update the governance framework when the token is live.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nUSDf has its own [Chainlink data feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/usdf-usd) and has permissioned mint and redemption processes to protect the peg.\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nFalcon Finance's smart contracts have undergone multiple audits to ensure security and reliability. Audit reports are available in the [Falcon Finance Documentation](https://docs.falcon.finance/).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nFalcon Finance is designed to minimize centralization risks. \n\n### 5. Market History\n\nAs a new Balancer v3 pool, the USDf/aGHO pair aims to establish itself as a significant liquidity venue for USDf. The integration with Aave's aGHO token is expected to enhance liquidity and efficiency.\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **USDf/aGHO** pool will become the primary liquidity hub for USDf, facilitating seamless integrations with lending protocols. Establishing deep liquidity in this pool is critical for efficient swaps and expanding USDf's utility across the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: `0x6c5972311191097D002E804A9Bf97C96C54059ed` \n- Gauge(address): `0x52d28dff7759ca78978954ebabf87481bd5cf8f0` \n- GaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

The protocol aims to streamline interactions with decentralized finance, making it more cost-efficient and profitable through differentiated fund management strategies. Zunami's main product is the UZD stablecoin, which is designed as a rebase token that increases in value proportionally to the APY (annual percentage yield) of the Zunami Protocol. UZD is over-collateralized by stablecoins allocated in revenue-generating strategies and minted using ZLP. The UZD design guarantees protection against depeg as it is fully backed by stablecoins stored in yield pools generating income, ensuring it can be redeemed at any time.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The Zunami team plans to create a pool with deep liquidity on Balancer and seed the pool with initial liquidity. The design of the UZD stablecoin involves deactivating the rebase mechanism while it is in the pool, directing revenue from collateral to the treasury for LP yield maintenance. As a result, the profits from the UZD in the UZD/bb-a-USD pool will be utilized as bribes on Aura through Hidden Hands. We believe that connecting the UZD pool to BAL emissions has a positive impact on Balancer as a new UZD pool with a high APY can attract more users. Zunami intends to become a stable and long-term Briber, while also planning to include some Balancer pools in the ETH and USD Zunami omni pools to provide liquidity.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Zunami operates as a decentralized protocol managed by the DAO. We have not yet launched our token, so the votes are currently distributed among Zunami LP, UZD holders, and UZD pools LP in proportion to their investments in Zunami products, and all key decisions are made via voting on the snapshot platform. While the team multisig currently holds all control, the smart contract allows them to add new strategies only after a one-day pause. In the future, Zunami plans to launch its own governance token, ZUN, and transition to a completely on-chain DAO model.\n2. **Oracles:** Zunami does not use oracles that can somehow affect the price of collaterals or UZD.\n\n3. **Audits:** The current version of Zunami and its stablecoin UZD have been audited by Ackee Blockchain and HashEx. The audit reports can be found at the following links:\n\n> [ZunamiProtocol/Zunami Audit Report v1.1.pdf at main · ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiProtocol · GitHub](https://github.com/ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiProtocol/blob/main/audit/Zunami%20Audit%20Report%20v1.1.pdf)\n[ZunamiStable/abch-zunami-uzd-report.pdf at main · ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiStable · GitHub](https://github.com/ZunamiProtocol/ZunamiStable/blob/main/audit/abch-zunami-uzd-report.pdf)\nhttps://hashex.org/audits/zunami-protocol/\nhttps://hashex.org/audits/zunami-protocol-uzd/\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** There’s no single person or dev with admin controls over the protocol. But the main actions, such as adding new strategies, assigning a default strategy for input and output, as well as rebalancing funds between strategies, are carried out using a Team multi-sig 0xb056B9A45f09b006eC7a69770A65339586231a34\n\n5. **Market History:** UZD was launched 1,5 Month ago on Curve in a pair with FRAXBP and has a TVL of over $1.8 million. Since its inception, there have been no significant deviations from the $1 price.\n \n6. **Value:** Zunami plans to attract more users by creating a high-APY UZD/bb-a-USD pool and becoming a stable long-term briber on hidden hands\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv3 `0x5efBb12F01f27F0E020565866effC1dA491E91A4` and call the `addEthereumGauge` function with the following argument:\n\n`0x21cf9324d5b1ac739b7e6922b69500f1eedb52e0` which corresponds to the capped gauge for this pool.",

        "body": "## PR with Payload\n\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1377\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to enable a veBAL gauge for the MORE/GYD E-CLP pool on Arbitrum, created in partnership with Gyroscope. By introducing this gauge, we aim to incentivize liquidity provision and enhance trading activity for the MORE stablecoin on Arbitrum. This pool will serve as the primary liquidity source for MORE on Arbitrum and will utilize Gyroscope's innovative E-CLP technology.\n\n* Pool:https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x4284c68f567903537e2d9ff726fdf8591e431ddc0002000000000000000005b5\n* Child gauge on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3b9c6c47bd3ac2e5e284265757ea2f6a4aed5fcc\n* Arbitrum root gauge on Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2400b9BAfb56Ec6D9eCeE50aF463A155Cf46db98#readContract\n\n## References / Useful Links\n\n* [Website / App](https://www.stackmore.xyz/)\n* [Docs](https://docs.stackmore.xyz/)\n* [X](https://x.com/stackmorexyz)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/M5jG6t8JQE)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\n* MORE is a collateral-backed stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, issued by Stack Finance.\n* GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by [Gyroscope] https://gyro.finance/\n\nStack Finance is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol on the re.al L2 network, specializing in leveraging crypto-native and real-world asset (RWA) tokens. Users can deposit a variety of assets as collateral to borrow the stablecoin MORE. Advanced leverage features allow users to loop borrowed MORE to acquire additional collateral, making it highly effective when using yield-bearing tokens. Stack Finance is uniquely positioned to cater specifically to tokenized RWAs as the re.al blockchain is meant to be a liquidity hub for RWA DeFi.\n\nMORE is designed to maintain a $1 peg through collateral backing that exceeds $1 for every $1 of MORE issued. While Stack Finance considers MORE to be worth $1, the price may occasionally deviate. To stabilize the peg, the protocol employs mechanisms like interest rate adjustments and arbitrage opportunities, encouraging users to act in ways that restore the peg.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEnabling a gauge for the MORE/USDC E-CLP pool on Arbitrum aligns with Stack Finance's strategy to expand MORE's liquidity across multiple chain ecosystems. This initiative aims to boost liquidity by attracting more liquidity providers, enhance the trading experience through improved price stability and reduced slippage, which will help Stack Finance to strengthen its DeFi integrations.\n\n## Specifications\n\n* Governance: Stack Finance's governance is currently managed through a team-controlled multi-signature wallet. The protocol plans to transition to a decentralized governance model in the future, once the system achieves greater stability and market resilience.\n* Oracles: There are currently no oracles for MORE on Arbitrum. The protocol does not rely on external oracles for its core functionalities on this network.\n* Audits: Prior to deployment, Stack Finance underwent two comprehensive audit rounds to ensure the security and reliability of the protocol. The first was a private audit conducted by Omniscia, and the second audit was a public one performed by WatchPug. The detailed report from WatchPug's audit can be viewed[ here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlnOyweoD9Jy_0vNvDozPS5RVEOw_qwT/view).\n* Centralization Vectors: Currently, Stack Finance has centralization vectors primarily associated with upgradeability and governance control. The protocol's smart contracts are upgradeable via a multi-signature wallet controlled by the team. Additionally, until the protocol transitions to a decentralized governance model, the team retains control over protocol parameters and decision-making processes.\n* Market History: Since its launch in June 2024 on the re.al L2, Stack Finance has accumulated over $2M in TVL. The MORE stablecoin has consistently maintained its $1 peg, experiencing a maximum deviation of 2%, which was swiftly corrected as per protocol designed mechanisms. Stack Finance has deployed MORE liquidity pools across multiple ecosystems, including a MORE/USDT pool on ThenaFi on the BNB Chain, a MORE/USDC pool on Tokan on Scroll, and a MORE/USTB pool on PearlFi on re.al.\n* Value: The MORE/GYD E-CLP pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for MORE on Arbitrum. Enabling the gauge will incentivize liquidity providers by offering veBAL rewards and additional bribes from Stack Finance, thereby attracting more participants and increasing the pool's depth. This will generate consistent fees through heightened trading activity, benefiting the Balancer ecosystem as a consequence.\n\n#### Specification\n\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>\n>\n> gauge(address): `0x2400b9BAfb56Ec6D9eCeE50aF463A155Cf46db98`\n> gaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
