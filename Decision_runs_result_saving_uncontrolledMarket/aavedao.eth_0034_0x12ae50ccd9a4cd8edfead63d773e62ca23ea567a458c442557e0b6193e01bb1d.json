This proposal includes participation in key ecosystem initiatives at EthCC Cannes and Devconnect (Location TBD), among others.\n\nLast year, facilitated by the 2024 Grant, [we were able to create Open Finance Day and DeFi Renaissance Day ](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-event-recap-2024/20941)which were hugely successful in its two editions in Brussels and Bangkok. For 2025, we have decided to select two main events in the calendar in order to continue producing strategic high quality and impactful initiatives. \n\nGoals: present Aave Protocol’s latest innovations, help facilitate and open doors to new institutional and technological partnerships and cross-chain expansion, continue cementing Aave’s brand awareness as market leaders, help expand the DeFi Ecosystem alongside DAO friends and partners, bring together Aave DAO Service Providers.\n\n\n# **Background**\n\nAave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders. Aave has been the indisputable market leader for years, and institutions and fellow blockchain partners recognize this. \n\nAave is and should continue to lead the DeFi sector towards its consolidation, especially in this new year, where they have been experiencing the highest wave of adoption, paired with a much friendlier attitude towards crypto coming from governments and institutions. \n\nAave Protocol and its DAO are already the stewards of DeFi. Through hosting our own educational and networking events (DeFi Renaissance Day) and the powerful rAAVE as the main recreational event on the conference circuits, Aave Labs helps reinforce the hard work and milestones achieved by the DAO.\n\n\n# **Overview**\n\nAave Labs is requesting a grant for $750,000 paid in GHO for events in 2025:\n\n1. DeFi Summer Day at EthCC and Devconnect: we are looking to continue this event series. The events started in Brussels as Open Finance Day, and continued in Bangkok under its current name. Both events were extremely successful, among the most popular events in the respective calendars. We brought together the most prominent voices in DeFi to discuss the topics of the moment, in high production settings. This allowed us to leverage complementary external networks, credibility, and resources for the event. The events served as a display of the strength and the proficiency of the Aave Protocol brand.\\\n   The DeFi Day events are financed in collaboration with a selected group of aligned partners, that help as well in bringing awareness, expanding audience and elevating the brand value of the series. Some of the previous sponsors were:  ZKSync, Chainlink, Sky, Lido, Uniswap, Scroll, Centrifuge, and Ethena Labs.\n\n2. Merch: Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merch people actually wear, use, and love.\n\n3. rAAVE: To celebrate the community’s welcoming culture, we plan to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Cannes and Devconnect (Location TBD). Notably last year we successfully mitigated costs for the DAO by sourcing sponsors (Aptos and Chainlink) for rAAVE Bangkok, and the model proved successful, so we’ll be following this strategy in 2025. \n\n4. Side events currently being considered for small sponsorships and activations include: Aave v4 developer meetups and a hackathon, small self-hosted networking events and dinners during Berlin Blockchain Week, Token 2049 Singapore, Korea Blockchain Week, RWA Summit series, Stable Summit series and Chainlink SmartCon. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over to the next potential side event.\n\nThe majority of the grant will be used to create an impactful presence during Devconnect and EthCC. DevConnect week will be the marquee event of the year.\n\nAfter covering the aforementioned main sponsorships, any remaining budget will be directed towards side events related to the security of DeFi and smart contract technology. Any excess funds from this grant will be rolled over to be used for events during Q1 2026.\n\nWe’re pleased to confirm that the 2024 events strategy, which included careful budget allocation and partnering with top tier projects to co-finance the events, has resulted in $160,000 unspent funds that are being carried over towards the 2025 events.The proposed budget is in line with previous spending for similar events and covers all events of 2025. A recap on last year’s events was posted to governance last February, [here.](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-event-recap-2024/20941)\n\n**Aave Labs shall cover all travel expenses for its team members, and this proposal does not request any funds for these expenses, or include any compensation for Aave Labs’ work.**\n\n\n# **Next Steps**\n\n● ARFC\n\n● If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP\n\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nWe believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of $750,000 paid in GHO for activations and events for 2025 will not only help enrich the Aave Protocol ecosystem, but will foster innovation, brand expansion and recognition.",

        "body": "# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes the Aave DAO budget allocation on events at key ecosystem initiatives at EthCC and Devcon to help to reinforce Aave Protocol’s unique and positive culture, share technical knowledge, and attract new community members. These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values. Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nAave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.\n\nAlthough the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nAave Labs is requesting a budget allocation for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%). These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:\n\n1. Hackathons & Bounties: We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.\n2. Open Finance Day: We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers.\n3. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community.\n4. Merch: Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.\n5. rAAVE: To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.\n\n# **Activations**\n\n| Name | Date | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| rAAVE | July & Nov TBD | During the weeks of EthCC & Devcon. rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. The plan is to host two rAAVEs during the course of this proposal. |\n| Open Finance Day | July 9 | In partnership with Chainlink, Uniswap, and Aptos we would host an Open DeFi Day for talks, networking, and light bites during EthCC week. Talks will include members of those communities, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members. |\n| ETHGlobal Bangkok | Nov 15-17 | Sponsorship of one ETHGlobal hackathon, ETHGlobal Bangkok, focusing on quality developers. |\n| Devcon | Q4 | This will be the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, this event will be one of the most attended web3 events of 2024. |\n| Side Events | Q4 | Side events currently being considered include: SheFi Summit (Brussels, Singapore, Bangkok), DeFi Security Summit by Certora during Devcon, Stable Summit Brussels. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over to the next potential side event. |\n\nAfter covering the aforementioned main sponsorships, any remaining budget will be directed towards side events related to the security of DeFi and smart contract technology. Any excess funds from this grant will be rolled over to be used for events during Q1 2025. A recap on last year’s events was posted to governance last December, here.\n\nAave Labs shall cover all expenses for its team members, and this proposal does not request any funds for these expenses, or include any compensation for Aave Labs’ work.\n\n# **Next Steps**\n\n- Secure community feedback on ARFC\n- Snapshot vote\n- If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nWe believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of 650,000 GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2024 will not only help enrich the Aave Protocol ecosystem, but will foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition.\n\nWe look forward to the DAO’s support for this proposal for these events during 2024.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave Events & Sponsorship Grant 2024\nAuthor: Aave Labs\nDate: 2024-07-08\n---\n## Summary\nAave Labs is pleased to announce an event grant proposal. This proposal includes participation in key ecosystem initiatives at EthCC and Devcon among other events.\n\n## Goals\nTo reinforce Aave Protocol’s unique and positive culture, share technical knowledge, and attract new community members. These initiatives are aimed at helping to continue the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem by showcasing Aave Protocol’s core values.\n\n## Background\nAave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability, and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, contributors, and stakeholders.\n\nAlthough the Aave Protocol has emerged as a leader within DeFi, the sector at large is still in its nascent stages, and Aave should work hard to retain its spot as a leader. For the events proposal from the DAO for 2024, Aave Labs wants to concentrate on proposing fewer but higher-quality events to maximize impact. \n\n## Overview\nAave Labs is requesting a grant for 650,000 GHO for events for the remainder of 2024 for EthCC Brussels (45%) and Devcon Bangkok (55%):\n1. **Hackathons & Bounties:** We want to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol, as well as GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, and to remain visible and competitive in a growing industry, but also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem. We propose to sponsor one ETHGlobal hackathon in Q4 in Bangkok.\n2. **Open Finance Day:** We are hosting Open Finance Day in partnership with key players in DeFi for high quality talks, networking, and light bites. Talks will include members of the DeFi community, Aave Labs, and Aave DAO community members and service providers. \n3. **Side Events:** Hosting side events alongside major conferences is an opportunity to increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge, and industry insights. Typically featuring panels, workshops, and discussions led by industry experts, side events are designed to strengthen awareness of Aave and GHO technology among strategic audiences, reach new target audiences, and ensure Aave and GHO remain top-of-mind within and outside the community. \n4. **Merch:** Aave Labs seeks to create highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events, as part of community engagement and awareness-building efforts as well as to proliferate the new visual identity and the beloved Ronnie ghost. Aave Labs will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials and creation of merchandise people actually wear, use, and love.\n5. **rAAVE:** To celebrate the Aave community’s welcoming culture, we aim to host two more editions of the flagship rAAVE event. Throughout the past years rAAVE has positioned itself to be the most sought after event in the ecosystem. They foster community spirit and create memorable experiences. We will integrate the GHO Pass for ticketing logistics and manage press relations and social media to maximize awareness and inclusion. This year’s events will be hosted at EthCC in Brussels and Devcon in Bangkok. To mitigate some costs for rAAVE, we are planning to potentially obtain co-sponsorship with current or potentially new partners for the Aave ecosystem. Due to the event’s high visibility, it is crucial that if co-sponsorship is obtained, the selected partners are aligned with the Aave Community and this is conducted in a balanced manner.\n\nAfter covering the aforementioned main sponsorships, any remaining budget will be directed towards side events related to the security of DeFi and smart contract technology. Any excess funds from this grant will be rolled over to be used for events during Q1 2025. A recap on last year’s events was posted to governance last December, [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-events-sponsorship-budget/14953/18).\n\nAave Labs shall cover all expenses for its team members, and this proposal does not request any funds for these expenses, or include any compensation for Aave Labs’ work.\n\n## Next Steps\nIf Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP\n\n ## Conclusion\nWe believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of 650,000 GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2024 will not only help enrich the Aave Protocol ecosystem, but will foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition.\n\nWe look forward to the DAO’s support for this proposal for these events during 2024.",

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Aave Events & Sponsorship Budget\nAuthor: @AaveCompanies\nDate: 2023-10-15\n\n# Summary\nThis ARFC proposes the Aave DAO budget allocation on events at DevConnect, rAAVE, and ETHGlobal Istanbul that will drive awareness and attract new participants to the Aave’s Protocol, GHO, and Aave ecosystem. Thank you for reviewing this proposal and for your earlier questions and positive vote in the snapshot.\n\n# Motivation\nAave Protocol has consistently been at the forefront of DeFi innovation with pioneering features. With a strong emphasis on security, usability and composability, Aave has amassed a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users and stakeholders.\n\nAlthough the Aave Protocol has achieved success and recognition in DeFi, it’s important to retain strong community support and engagement as well as to continue to reach out to new people. We are proposing several thoughtful, well-organized and targeted events at DevConnect, including hackathons, booth presence, rAAVE and smaller side events that bring the broader community together. Community-building and reinforcing brand values and building recognition are essential to retaining and growing the participation of web3 users.\n\n# Overview\nAave Companies is requesting a budget allocation of $550,000 for the remainder of the year paid in GHO to support a range of targeted activations and events to continue growing and nurturing the global Aave Community. These initiatives will serve multiple purposes:\n1. Hackathons: Aave Companies intends to sponsor hackathons to encourage developers to build on Aave Protocol and stablecoin GHO. These hackathons not only provide a platform for the Aave community to connect with talented developers in both web3 and web2, but they also lead to the creation of innovative DeFi projects that enhance the Aave ecosystem.\n2. Side Events: Hosting side events alongside major conferences allows the Aave community to efficiently increase community awareness, foster connections, and share technical knowledge as well as industry insights. These events often include panels, workshops and discussions led by industry experts. Side events are also where Aave demonstrates our commitment to web3 ecosystem inclusivity and diversity by tapping into new communities and audiences. We’re proud to be supporters of groups such as SheFi and BoysClub.\n3. Merch: Aave Companies recognizes the importance of high-quality, sustainably produced merchandise in building brand recognition and loyalty. We intend to continue producing highly coveted Aave and GHO branded merchandise to distribute at events as part of community engagement efforts and to proliferate the ghost. We will continue to push for the use of sustainable materials, while creating merch that people actually wear, use and love. Finding appropriate partners is always extremely hard and we are proud that our team has been able to find good, cost-effective solutions. We don’t expose the cost per piece, however, we are very mindful of costs here and in all expenditures, making sure to receive bids and assess each partner individually for cost, quality, execution and sustainability.\n4. Development of the GHO Pass: With one of the core missions of the Aave community being to grow GHO by stimulating demand, expanding its utility, and accelerating its transactional velocity, we’re excited to announce Aave Companies’ development of the GHO Pass. The GHO Pass V1 will facilitate GHO purchases at both Aave events and sponsored events. We plan to launch GHO Pass at DevConnect, where users can get early access to select rAAVE tickets and drink credits, exclusive merch and other perks. This initiative will support GHO adoption and ensure that the Aave community and others unfamiliar with GHO, will experience the power of GHO as a payment layer at DevConnect and outside this event in the future. We plan for any proceeds from the GHO pass to go back directly into the budget for future activities that support the protocol and GHO. This is for accounting simplicity reasons.\n5. rAAVE: To celebrate, give back to the Aave community and attract new users, we plan for Aave DAO to host another edition of the vibrant and highly anticipated rAAVE event. This event serves as an excellent opportunity to create a memorable experience for the Aave community and spread Aave culture. We will also explore live streaming rAAVE, and integrating GHO pass (as mentioned above). As organisers, we will manage the ticketing logistics. We will also manage press relations social and other related Aave communications at no extra direct costs to the DAO. We want to keep the fine details of how the event is orchestrated and related detailed cost break down confidential both for flexibility and competitive reasons. The cost structure is a blueprint to how the event, which is unparalleled in the industry, is successfully executed. It is important that rAAVEs are available for Aave community members and we will find a way to provide a window of opportunity to claim a ticket. Tickets are available via multiple avenues tied to different activities and timing, and we conduct outreach to various organizations to target different audiences and demographics to enhance diversity and attract strategic partners and developers.\n\n# Activations\nActivations continue to be a key focus and driver of growth for the Aave ecosystem thanks to:\n- Creating a welcoming, engaging,memorable and Aave branded experience at the Aave booth.\n- Sponsoring side events, hackathons, prizes and providing exceptional support to developers.\n- Spreading Aave’s culture by distributing highly coveted merchandise.\n- Selectively hosting rAAVEs to bring the Aave community together, reward contributors and make Aave the top ecosystem in crypto.\n- Developing GHO Pass payment portal to showcase the power and utility of GHO.\n\n| Name  |  Date  | Details |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| ETH Global Istanbul  | Nov 17-19  | During the week of Devconnect. ETHGlobal puts on arguably the most reputable hackathon events in the Ethereum ecosystem. Istanbul is a community with substantial and growing crypto adoption and is a prime market to engage hackers and the community with Aave and GHO.  |\n| rAAVE  | Nov TBD  | rAAVE brings the community together, helping to strengthen Aave’s culture and differentiate Aave’s ecosystem. We will host one rAAVE during the course of this proposal that is powered by GHO to help spread adoption and awareness.  |\n| Devconnect + Side Events  | Nov 13-19  | Devconnect is the event of the year in the Ethereum community. Hosted by the Ethereum Foundation, it is expected to be the most attended web3 event of 2023. Activating here allows us to efficiently reach a wide audience of developers and others in the broader ecosystem and connect with many from our community. The total allocation request for DevConnect covers several side events that are selected carefully to maximize impact. The booth experience and design is in line with previous spending and the Aave booth consistently outperforms, attracting a significant number of developers, community members and people who are unfamiliar to the Protocol.  |\n| Side Events\t  | Q4  | Side events selection is based on strengthening Aave’s and GHO’s presence within various strategic audiences, outreaching to new target audiences, ensuring Aave remains top-of-mind within and outside the community, and gaining awareness of GHO. Side events we’re currently considering include: SheFi Summit Istanbul, Certora at DevConnect, Scroll Day, notDevcon by ITU Blockchain, StableSummit Istanbul. Funds from any side events that are not confirmed will be rolled over and held in the marketing budget for potential other side events of import here or at other events in the future.  |\n\nFor this proposal, Aave Companies is focusing on sponsoring fewer events, while increasing the quality and impact of Aave’s presence.\n\nA majority of the new event spend will be used to have an impactful presence during Devconnect, ETHGlobal Istanbul, and rAAVE to drive hackers to build with GHO and to increase GHO utilization within the wider community. Since Devconnect week will be the marquee event of the year, any remaining budget after the main sponsorships will be allocated to side events related to DeFi or Smart Contract Security.\n\nWe have a robust tracking system for all Aave DAO-related expenditures. We are very careful to sequester funds and have strong internal ethical guidelines and accounting procedures that are followed to ensure funds are used appropriately. Aave Companies will ensure that the budget from this proposal will be used only for specific, community approved, Aave-related endeavors and that any excess budget is rolled back into the events marketing budget that supports Aave and GHO outreach.\n\n# Next Steps\n- If Snapshot is successful, then move to AIP\n\n# Conclusion\nAave Companies is deeply committed to the Aave community. We believe that the proposed one-off budget allocation of $550,000 paid in GHO for activations and events for the remainder of 2023 will not only enrich the Aave ecosystem but also foster innovation, inclusivity, and recognition. We look forward to the DAO’s support in enabling these important initiatives to come to life and continue to drive the growth of the Aave ecosystem. We will rollover any excess allocation to Q1 2024 events.",

        "body": "**Title:** [ARFC] karpatkey GHO Growth Service Provider\n\n**Author**: karpatkey\n\n**Date**: 2024-12-15\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicexfltthusqm4b5qldyfuuowezre3mgkvnipzgdlskwl432sgakm)\n    \n\n\n# Summary\n\nThe current ARFC proposes appointing karpatkey as a service provider dedicated to drive the growth of GHO for the following 6 months, with an initial focus on opportunities within the Gnosis Chain while also expanding efforts to other chains.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past 12 months, karpatkey has been pleased to have supported the AaveDAO in improving treasury management practices and GHO adoption (see [Phase 1](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633) and [Phase 2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-tokenlogic-karpatkey-financial-service-providers-phase-ii/18285) for more details). These efforts have been a significant success, and will continue, with the deployment of the [Finance Steward](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570)  upcoming features. That said, by focusing on increasing GHO’s adoption, we believe karpatkey can provide more value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nThe stablecoin ecosystem is one of the most dynamic and competitive sectors in the DeFi landscape, and the accelerating adoption of GHO represents a unique opportunity for Aave DAO to solidify its position as a leader in this space. Since its deployment over a year ago, GHO achieved a notable milestone of a 180M supply across mainnet and Arbitrum, market depth in most reputable DEXes with total liquidity ranging between $30M and $50M. This success is a testament to the strength of Aave’s products, user base and brand.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigsbyl7vbhlbp4cwk7usqueivly4cdhtz7ibdvois3zerjx5t5xsm)\n    \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibrbisgdqx6tbdqbo5sxztbuakpbxe6rq5qd5v3irsufufwn57aju)\n    \n\nSource: [GHO Dashboard](https://dune.com/karpatkey/gho-weekly-digest-kpk)\n\nWhile GHO’s initial growth has been remarkable, the stablecoin market is evolving rapidly. The demand for reliable, decentralised stablecoins continues to grow, and GHO is well-positioned to capture this market—provided we continue to expand its utility, adoption, and ecosystem integrations proactively.\n\nkarpatkey has the [tools and resources](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-defi-treasury-network) to capitalise on the range of opportunities GHO presents. With a [proven track record in DeFi innovation](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure) and [strong partnerships with other DAOs](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), we are excited to present our new 6-month proposal to Aave DAO, focused on the areas where we can contribute most.\n\nTo drive proactive growth and expansion of GHO across multiple blockchains, we are proposing a phased mandate that includes tailored strategies for each ecosystem, with the initial phase prioritizing the deployment and adoption of GHO on the Gnosis Chain. With an Aave instance holding $100M, Gnosis Chain currently has a total value locked of $410M and a thriving environment of stablecoins, which includes Gnosis Pay, Monerium’s e-money EURe and other RWAs. We plan to focus primarily on opportunities where both AaveDAO and GnosisDAO can mutually benefit from a vibrant GHO ecosystem on Gnosis Chain, taking advantage of karpatkey’s unique position supporting both the DeFi ecosystems of both DAOs.\n\n# Specification\n\nDuring this first phase, our objectives will include:\n\n- Expanding GHO’s supply and utility through strategic integrations across the blockchains where GHO is deployed, and those where it will be deployed next, establishing GHO as a stablecoin of choice while maintaining its peg stability. karpatkey will continue to support the GHO stewards and the ALC to make this possible.\n- The deployment of GHO on Gnosis Chain,  in collaboration with other Aave Service Providers, to optimise the Gnosis Chain Aave instance for GHO’s adoption and success.\n- Introducing an sGHO vault on Gnosis Chain, building on the success of sDAI. This vault, to be developed in collaboration with @ACI, will provide a risk-minimized yield alternative that can be used as collateral for enhanced capital efficiency. The yield will be sourced through the successful Merit program, and will be amplified on Gnosis Chain by allocating incentives to staked liquidity only, further establishing GHO as a superior savings vehicle.\n- Drive a successful launch by establishing a 5M Aave treasury under non-custodial management infrastructure powered by Safe and [Zodiac Module](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure) technology. This infrastructure, developed by karpatkey and successfully utilized in our contributions to GnosisDAO, ENS, Balancer, and Nexus, will initially be funded with USDC. The treasury will support market-making activities for GHO on Gnosis Chain to seed market liquidity and integrations.\n- Manage the integrations of GHO in Gnosis Chain with key DeFi protocols. Particularly, we will explore optimal lending-market parameters and the value proposition of the EURe/GHO pair, maximizing the value of Gnosis Chain’s long-term foreign exchange use-cases.\n\n**Budget and duration**\n\nAfter a successful vote, this proposal will be funded with the following stream:\n\n- Budget 250K GHO over 180 days.\n- Address: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\nWe propose that the stream be funded with GHO from the Lido market to reduce Aave’s opportunity cost.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nkarpatkey is also a service provider for Gnosis DAO.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nAfter sufficient time for discussion and feedback on this proposal in the forum, we will escalate it to an ARFC Snapshot vote.\n\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP vote will be published for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
