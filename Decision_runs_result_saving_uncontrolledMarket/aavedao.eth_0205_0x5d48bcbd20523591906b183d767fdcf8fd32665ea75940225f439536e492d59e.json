It includes a template for crafting proposals and outlines the quorum and voting requirements.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Distinction Between TEMP CHECK and ARFC\n\nTEMP CHECKs serve as \"temperature checks\" to gauge community sentiment on a proposal or topic. They do not necessitate service provider involvement or a high level of precision or technicality.\n\nConversely, ARFCs are precursors to Aave Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Relevant service providers are formally invited to provide feedback on them, and the specification section of ARFCs should detail how the potential upcoming AIP will impact Aave protocol smart contracts.\n\n### Proposal Template\n\nEach proposal **must** include the following sections:\n\nA header:\n1. **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for the proposal, including the proposal type (ARFC or TEMP CHECK) in a [TAG] format.\n2. **Author**: The name of the author and/or entity creating the proposal.\n3. **Date**: The date the proposal is being made, in the YYYY-MM-DD format.\n\nA proposal body:\n\n1. **Summary**: A succinct summary of the proposal.\n2. **Motivation**: A detailed presentation of the proposal and potential benefits for the Aave protocol. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n3. **Specification**: A comprehensive description of the proposed change, including any relevant parameters or risk considerations. For ARFCs, this section should be technical, detailing the specific changes to be made. This section can have sub-sections for improved readability.\n4. **Disclaimer**: Any necessary disclaimers, such as conflicts of interest or third-party involvement.\n5. **Next Steps**: The proposed next steps if the proposal is approved.\n6. **Copyright**: A statement defining proposal copyright. While Open-Source is **mandatory**, the choice of a specific license is left to the author.\n\n### Voting Guidelines\n\n1. **Vote Start Time**: The vote should commence 24 hours after the proposal is published on Snapshot.\n2. **Proposal Age**: The governance thread related to the snapshot vote should be at least 5 days old before voting begins.\n3. **Vote Duration**: The vote should last for a minimum of 3 days.\n4. **Vote Options**: The vote should have at least three options: YAE (Yes), NAY (No), and ABSTAIN.\n5. **Quorum**: The vote should reach a quorum of 320,000 YAE votes.\n6. **Differential**: The YAE votes should exceed the second-largest vote option (either NAY or ABSTAIN) by at least 80,000.\n\n### Proposal Cycle:\n\n![image|1920x920](upload://fPsMYVukUCZ2OFHwDUzkFUgc9dw.jpeg)\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nThis framework should be considered as a general template for general proposals. Specific proposals and/or frameworks, such as asset onboarding or caps updates, should follow specific guidelines as determined by the Aave DAO community.\n\nThis framework is designed to ensure that all proposals are thoroughly considered and that all votes are fair and representative of the Aave DAO community's views.\n\n## Specification\n\nAs this proposal pertains to governance guidelines, it does not require any on-chain action or protocol change.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps \n\n1) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2) If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] New Chain Deployment Framework\nAuthor: @0xTogbe - Aave Chan Initiative\nCreated: 2023-11-28\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks the community’s approval for a framework to deploy the Aave Protocol on a new blockchain.\nThis framework outlines the standardized process for any blockchain seeking to deploy on Aave Protocol. The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired.

This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Integration Review: Outline the technical details of the proposed integration. This includes specifics on how Aave’s lending and borrowing functionalities will interact with new Aave Deployment. For that, please share the result of both documentation submission and technical review, from TEMP CHECK, so community can understand the level of work, security and commitment. Avoid providing sensitive information.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for ARFC phase, that has been as well implemented in TEMP CHECK stage, to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments.\n\nTo be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not, and details\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n\nSpecification: Include the initial assets that should be available as collateral and their risk parameters in a table. These should have received input from at least one risk manager service provider.\n\nDeployment Checklist: New deployments must have all of the following completed prior to posting an ARFC.\n\n- Risk service providers feedback\n- BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation\n- Oracle recommendation\n- The graph support\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide.

Since the Asset Onboarding Framework was published in the Forum in November 2023, there have been several requests from teams to list their assets, and the corresponding governance process for adding new markets.\n\nThis proposal aims to streamline the listing process for Aave DAO by requiring new listing candidates to deposit at least $100 worth of the intended asset into the Aave Short Executor.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nAs part of the deployment process for any new asset, a small amount of the asset is deposited at the moment the market is seeded. This prevents potential market manipulation and issues from arising. In the past, members of Aave DAO have had to purchase all newly listed assets and deposit them into the Aave Short Executor to allow this initial deposit process to occur. In order to simplify the process for members of the Aave DAO and demonstrate commitment from projects getting an Aave onboarding, this proposal requires a deposit of $100 worth of the intended asset.\n\nThis amount will be used to seed the markets upon launch.\n\nthis deposit is not meant to be an “onboarding fee”\n\nThe goal is to make the process more seamless for the implementation of onboarding, as sourcing tokens & feeding the executors’ contracts adds friction in our current onboarding pipeline.  \n\n# **Specification**\n\n1. Deposit requirement:\n    1. Each new listing candidate will deposit $100 worth of the intended asset into the Aave Short Executor.\n    2. The deposit will serve as both a commitment to the process and a way to initially seed the market.\n    3. The deposit will be made:\n        1. Once an asset has passed the associated ARFC\n        2. It must be deposited before an asset can proceed to the AIP phase\n    4. The deposit will be non-refundable. If the proposal does not pass at AIP, the deposit will not be refunded.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC Addendum], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, the Addendum will be considered canon, and the guidelines will be adopted into the Asset Onboarding Framework.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The authors propose a process by which interested parties publish an application to the Aave Forum (governance.aave.com 1), after a period of discussion and comment, an offchain vote is taken using Snapshot. Should that temperature check vote be successful, an on-chain vote targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor will formally add the address and its initial cap to the GHO system as a facilitator. This post outlines the process in detail, an addition includes 2 sample applications for each of the facilitators Aave Companies has released publicly, Aave V3 & Flash Minter.\n\n# Motivation\nThe GHO Stablecoin Protocol will be governed by the Aave DAO, specifically the Aave DAO Short Executor. There are 3 new processes that the Aave DAO will need to implement:\n- a process for facilitator onboarding\n- a process for adjustment of a facilitator limit\n- a process for facilitator offboarding.\n\nThis document only intends to address the first of these processes.\n\n# Implementation\nThe Facilitator onboarding process will begin with a post on the Aave Governance Forum (governance.aave.com 1) conforming to the template below. Next, a 7 day discussion period will commence for the community to ask questions. After the discussion period a snapshot temperature check can be posted on Snapshot. The standard snapshot process with an informal quorum of 320,000 votes is suggested to ensure sufficient community input is received and to keep consistency with existing governance processes. Should the temperature check be successful, another discussion period of 7 days will commence for the community to further refine the proposal. The authors hope that during this second period technical and risk contributors especially provide feedback on the proposed facilitator design, terms of the credit line and the initial GHO limit being requested. Following this second discussion period, an on-chain proposal targeting the Aave DAO Short Executor can then be posted via the Aave DAO Governance contracts to formally on-board the facilitator with its initial GHO limit.\n\n# Specification\nFOR - Adopt this process for onboarding GHO Facilitators\n\nNAE - Do not adopt this process for onboarding GHO Facilitators\n\nABSTAIN - Abstain\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\n# Facilitator Application Template\n## Background\n- Title of Facilitator\n- High Level Description of Mechanism / Request\n- Author / Link to License\n- Link to whitepaper (if applicable)\n- How Facilitator Furthers GHO\n- Organization / DAO responsible for operation of the Facilitator (if applicable)\n- History, Details, Background of the operator of the Facilitator (if applicable)\n## Credit Line Details\n- Requested Facilitator Cap\n- Cap Increase Roadmap (if applicable)\n- Use of Funds\n- Revenue Streams\n- Revenue Split / Interest Terms\n- Collateral Posted\n- Other Commercial Details/Considerations\n## Mechanism & Risk Details\n- Detailed Description of the Facilitator\n- How Facilitator is backing GHO\n- If RWA - description of legal structure etc\n- Detail any / all risks (Oracle risk, Third-party Dependencies, Contract risk, Cross-chain, Bridging, Regulatory, etc) as well as any prevention/mitigation methods\n## Governance Controls\n- List of controls given to Aave DAO\n- Controls given not to Aave DAO\n- Alternative controls / roles that may be present but not set (optimistic governance?
