The proposal aims to allocate funds to the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) treasury for the next six months, enabling us to actively engage in the Aave ecosystem and contribute to its growth and improvement.\n\n## Abstract:\nif this proposal were to be approved by governance, a stream of the allocated budget would be started to the ACI treasury wallet. It will be used to cover various aspects of the ACI's involvement in the Aave community, including team compensation, community engagement, research and development, infrastructure costs & tooling subscriptions, marketing, and communications.\n\n## Motivation:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been a dedicated contributor to the Aave ecosystem. The 6-Month Budget Proposal aims to secure the necessary resources to continue the ACI's work, ensuring that we can maintain our level of commitment and contribution to the Aave ecosystem. For more details about the ACI proposal, please refers to the [TEMP CHECK version of the current proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344)\n\n## Specification:\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with `treasury.aavechan.eth` (0x57ab7ee15cE5ECacB1aB84EE42D5A9d0d8112922) as the recipient. This will allow the ACI to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 250,000 aUSDT.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is an independent organization focused on contributing to the Aave ecosystem. This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

We propose a strategic shift towards harnessing protocol economic activity to generate \"real yield\" through the introduction of GHO as an additional Safety Incentive. \n\nBy directing part of GHO revenue to the Safety Incentives, we aim to create a dual reward system, offering stakers both AAVE and GHO tokens. While the contribution of GHO to Safety Incentives may initially be a small fraction of the total incentives, it represents a significant step towards the protocol's maturity and sustainability. \n\nThis proposal, suggests that the governance should adjust the distribution percentage quarterly, in response to market conditions.\n\nAs the Aave protocol already generates sustainable revenue that covers service provider costs, the introduction of GHO into the Safety Incentives mix is a viable and strategic move toward diversifying Safety Incentives and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the protocol.\n\n### Potential Implementation\n\nWhile technicals details of the implementation will be discussed at a potential ARFC stage of this proposal, and current stage is meant to gauge community's general interest, here's a diagram of a possible implementation, redirecting GHO revenue from Collector contract (dao treasury) to a splitter contract controlled by governance.\n\n![image|2000x1028](upload://beyTiZ0BzFAVqdN2btMmu855a04.png)\n\n### Initial Parameters\n\nWe propose to set a potential \"Gho Splitter\" contract with\n- 80% toward COLLECTOR contract (Aave DAO treasury)\n- 20% toward REWARDS_VAULT (controlling safety incentives)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage for service provider feedback and implementation discussions.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

At launch the `StrategicAssetManager` will manage the DAO's veBAL holding.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave DAO is soon to attain a veBAL holding. To maximise the upside for holding the strategic asset, the DAO needs a practical means of managing the asset.\n\nThe veBAL holding needs to be continually relocked to optimise goverance and rewards. Gauge votes are weekly and would require numerous AIPs to manage the veBAL effectively. Aave DAO also has an opportunity to participate in Balancer's governance on Snapshot votes via delegating governance rights.\n\nThe StrategicAssetManage will also hold the sdCRV position if approved by AIP. Yield generated from each strategic holding can be claimed, swapped and redeposited to compound into each strategy over time. The swaps have MEV protection and can be customised to have defined maximum amount of price impact.\n\nGiven the sheer volume and frequency of transactions to be performed, there exists a desire to minimum AIP votes. The StrategicAssetManager contains the ability for the `ShortExecutor` to assign an `AssetManager`. This role can be likened to a Treasury Committee (as suggested Part 4 of SM upgrade publications) and provides the DAO optionality to introduce a committee separte from this proposal once adequate guidelines are in place. \n\nThe contract contains an allow list which implements tight restrictions around which contracts the `AssetManager` role can interact with. Further definition relating to what the `AssetManager` can do will be defined in the [ARFC] publication.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the StrategicAssetManager:\n\n* Deposit/withdraw voteEscrow contract \n* Lock/relock B-80BAL-WETH\n* Participate in gauge votes\n* Delegate governance voting rights\n* Allocate boost\n* Update boost\n* Delegate boost\n* Allow boost on Warden \n* List boost on Warden (if the  DAO votes for it)\n* Claim protocol fees & other rewards \n* Transfer assets (ie: collector contracts)\n* Ability to lock other strategic assets\n* Receive assets from the collector\n* Receive assets from the Economic Reserve\n\nThe contract is upgradeable and controlled by Aave's [`Short Executor`](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide#the-short-executor-is-used-for-non-governance-related-proposals-such-as-asset-listing-parameter-upda) role via governance. Each function on the contract can be implemented via the `ShortExecutor` whilst also having the ability to assign and remove, a `AssetManager` role to a community elected address. There is also the possibility of having an IncentiveManager contract that could take on some of the listed functions defined above. These details will be worked through in the future.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Introducing \"Curator\" by Llama\nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon and Fermin\ncreated: 2023-07-11\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces the `Curator` by Llama.\n\nThe `Curator` is a dedicated contract for managing the exchange of assets with MEV and price-impact protection, where possible.\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the Curator:\n\n* Swap Assets\n* Acquire LSTs\n* Transfer Assets\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe DAO is required to exchange assets. This could be to reduce the DAOs exposure to long tail assets or to increase stable coin holdings to facilitate payment to various service providers. It is not possible to perform swaps directly from the Collector / Treasury Contract. After much discussion, @llamaxyz and @bgdlabs have concluded that it is not viable to upgrade the Collector Contract to facilitate the efficient management of the DAO's assets. As a result, a series of separate contracts are required. \n\nA part of this solution is the `Curator`. The `Curator` receives assets from the Collector / Treasury Contract, swaps (or deposits) assets and sends the newly received asset to another address. The `Curator` is intended for solely exchanging assets and not holding assets. \n\nThe first iteration of the `Curator` is to be deployed on Ethereum and then later introduced to other networks. On Ethereum, the `Curator` is to interact with CoW Swap, Lido Protocol, and Rocket Pool contracts. \n\nTo limit the surface area of the contract, an `AllowList` will define which contracts the `Curator`can be interacted with. The `ShortExecutor` must first add each contract address to the `AllowList`. \n\nIt is possible to assign the `curatorRole()` to a specified wallet address, Treasury Manager. The `curatorRole` can then only interact with contract on the `AllowList` set by governance. The `AllowList` eliminates the risk of the `Curator` interacting with a malicious contract or running away with the DAO's funds. The intent is to implement the highest heirarchy of control.\n\nFor future deployments of the `Curator` on other networks, the aggregator protocol used to swap assets with MEV protection does so over a lengthy time horizon. This prevents any further steps performed by the same AIP submission. In these instances the `curatorRole` offers more flexibility and reduces the AIP overhead.\n\nEach Curator deployment will contain different functionality tailored to that network and Aave DAO's needs. As a result, each deployment will be presented to Aave DAO as an [ARFC] proposal for the community to discuss and vote on. \n\nDuring the intial deployment on Ethereum, @Llamaxyz advocates for using the `ShortExecutor` to perform all the necessary transactions. The `curatorRole` can be assigned at a later date. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe Ethereum Curator will provide the following functionality to Aave Protocol: \n\n1. Receive assets from the Treasury (assets must be pushed)\n2. Redeem aTokens for underlying spanning Aave v1, v2, and v3\n3. Swap assets via CoW Swap with MEV protection and using Milkman\n4. No reentrant \n5. Cancel trade\n6. Rescue tokens\n7. allowTokens(address[] tokens) onlyExecutorOrAllowedCaller\n8. Deposit ETH into Lido Finance Protocol to receive stETH\n9. Wrap stETH to create wstETH\n10. Deposit ETH into Rocket Pool's contract to receive rETH\n11. Transfer assets to Treasury\n12. Call a function to deposit assets in Aave v3 on behalf of Treasury\n13. Allow-list tokens/contracts that can be interacted with\n14. Allow-list Executor and approved multisig, CuratorRole().\n\nThe Curator will contain an `AllowList` defining which contracts the contract can interact with. The `AllowList` can only be updated by Aave Governance via the `ShortExecutor`. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nUpon recieving a favourable Snapshot vote, @llamaxyz will continue finalising the payload in preparation for submitting to @BGDlabs for peer review. An [ARFC] post will be shared and progressed through governance.\n\nThe [ARFC] publication will provide greater insights to the functions on the contract and the Treasury Committee will be a separate [ARFC].\n\n# Disclosure\n\n@llamaxyz is a service provider to Aave DAO.

By aligning the risk parameters of USDT with those of USDC, we anticipate an increase in borrowing power for users. This change is expected to stimulate borrowing volume on Aave, thereby contributing to the protocol's revenue. The activation of collateral power for USDT is a strategic move towards creating a more dynamic, efficient, and profitable liquidity environment within the Aave ETH V3 pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following table outlines the proposed risk parameters for USDT in the Aave ETH V3 pool, which will replicate the risk parameters of USDC:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value (USDT) | Proposed Value (USDT) | Current Value (USDC) |\n|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| LTV       | 0%                   | 74%                  | 74%                  |\n| LT        | 0%                   | 76%                  | 76%                  |\n| LB        | 0%                   | 4.5%                 | 4.5%                 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- If the ARFC Snapshot is successful, the proposal will be escalated to the Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) stage for final approval.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

      "Llama underperformed in crucial tasks such as the CRV AIP, causing the DAO approximately $1 million in additional costs.",
      "Llama charged third parties for consulting on Aave-related matters despite receiving $1.5 million from the DAO.",
      "Treasury management failures led to several service providers going unpaid, harming the DAO's reputation.",

      "Llama asserts ongoing critical work that will benefit the DAO beyond the contract period, including the Curator and Strategic Asset Manager contracts.",
      "Llama argues that the remaining contract period is short and the cancellation sets a bad precedent.",
      "Concerns about concentration of power were raised due to ACI’s large delegation and administrative roles.",
