For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n>\n>\n>2. **Oracles:** \n> * ‘rateProvider0’: wstETH rate provider on Ethereum: [0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72D07D7DcA67b8A406aD1Ec34ce969c90bFEE768)\nand relevant [review ](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/wstethRateProvider.md).\n> *  ‘rateProvider1’: GYD rate provider on Ethereum: [0xD43F5a722e8e7355D790adda4642f392Dfb820a1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD43F5a722e8e7355D790adda4642f392Dfb820a1).\n>\n>3. **Audits:** Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production since November 2022.\n>\n>4. **Centralization vectors:** No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n>\n>5. **Market History:** This is the first wstETH/GYD E-CLP on Ethereum.\n>\n>6. **Value:** This pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s). \n\n#### Contracts\n\n> * E-CLP: [0xC8cF54b0b70899Ea846B70361e62F3F5B22b1f4B](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC8cF54b0b70899Ea846B70361e62F3F5B22b1f4B)\n>* Gauge: [0xCda69C40176B98bB1773109d1fEa91e12F478451](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCda69C40176B98bB1773109d1fEa91e12F478451)\n\n\n#### Specification\n\n\n>Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>gauge(address): `0xCda69C40176B98bB1773109d1fEa91e12F478451`\n>gaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Currently, the Aave Protocol has a TVL of approximately $11.63 Billion.\n>\n> GHO is a decentralized multi-collateral stable coin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol.\n>\n>**pyUSD & Trident**\n> PayPal is a globally recognized leader in the payments and remittance industry. Its entrance to the crypto space with the launch of pyUSD represents a significant step into the Web3 world as the company looks to expand and improve its product offerings.\n>\n> Launched in August 2023, pyUSD is a partnership between PayPal and the Paxos Trust Company, whose previous assets include USDP and BUSD. The code for pyUSD is built on Paxos previous success with the aforementioned USDP token. Paxos is a New York State Department of Financial Services regulated Trust that acts as a qualified custodian of fully bankruptcy remote and segregated funds. Paxos issued coins such as pyUSD are always redeemable 1:1 and its reserves are held in cash and US Treasuries.\n>\n>Trident Digital is an experienced digital asset solutions provider that works with counterparties to achieve a number of goals across the crypto space. Trident Digital aims to scale stable coin adoption both within and outside the crypto market through strong relationships and experience navigating both the crypto and traditional finance markets. Our previous on-chain work includes facilitation of incentives for the [USDP-PSM](https://messari.io/governor/proposal/57b2db7d-7505-4190-9696-ac2c344e46a2).\n>\n> While the pyUSD/GHO pool currently holds no funds Trident Digital is working with partners to provide deep liquidity to the pool in the very near future.\n>\n>## Motivation\n>\n>This proposal aims to add one new veBAL gauge.\n>\n>GHO/pyUSD E-CLP - Range: -80bps to 50bps\n\n>## Specification\n>\n>1. **Governance:** \n>\n>* AAVE, aAAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO.

There is no governance structure outside of that dictated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\n>\n>* All pyUSD is issued 1:1 against funds held in either cash or US Government Treasuries. All funds backing pyUSD are held bankruptcy remote with New York Banking laws protecting customer funds from being used to satisfy any debt of Paxos.\n>\n>* The E-CLP Pool type, the FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n>\n>5. **Market History:** \n>* [GHO](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)\n>* [pyUSD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/paypal-usd)\n>\n>6. **Value:**\n>* This pool is expected to drive meaningful TVL to Balancer and Aura Finance. The assets within the pool are not yield bearing. However, the DAOs will generate revenue from receiving a portion of the swap fees.\n\n>## Pool Details\n>Link to Pool: GHO/pyUSD Pool - Range: -80bps to 50bps - [0x4c4Ed61D81F531Dcb34Ad4d498548917ABA3D193](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x4c4ed61d81f531dcb34ad4d498548917aba3d193000200000000000000000680)\n>Link to Gauges: B-GHO-pyUSD - [0xb71C90F165cf99d4004499fF058E265Aa68fAC85](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb71C90F165cf99d4004499fF058E265Aa68fAC85) \n>\n>Transaction: Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xb71C90F165cf99d4004499fF058E265Aa68fAC85`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\n>## Disclosure\n>\n>This proposal is the work of Tokenlogic and karpatkey who are both Service Providers and delegates within the Aave Ecosystem.",

With a current total value locked of approximately $31 billion, Aave remains a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem.\n>\n>GHO, Aave’s native decentralized stablecoin, is [fully collateralized](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/gho), transparent, and designed to integrate seamlessly within the protocol, enhancing accessibility and utility across its ecosystem.\n\n**PYUSD & Trident**\n\n>PayPal, a global leader in payments and remittance, has made a significant stride into the Web3 space with the launch of PYUSD, underscoring its commitment to expanding and enhancing its product offerings in the digital economy.\n>\n>Introduced in August 2023, PYUSD is the result of a collaboration between PayPal and Paxos Trust Company, the firm behind successful stablecoins such as USDP and BUSD. Built on Paxos’ proven USDP framework, PYUSD benefits from the regulatory oversight of the New York State Department of Financial Services. Paxos, as a regulated trust, ensures full segregation and bankruptcy-remote protection for its reserves, which are held entirely in cash and U.S. Treasuries. All Paxos-issued coins, including PYUSD, maintain a 1:1 redemption guarantee.\n>\n>Trident Digital, a seasoned provider of digital asset solutions, works closely with partners to drive stablecoin adoption across both crypto-native and traditional financial markets. Leveraging extensive experience and established relationships, Trident Digital has previously facilitated on-chain incentives for initiatives like the USDP-PSM.\n>\n>While the PYUSD/GHO liquidity pool is currently unfunded, partners will inject $8 million in liquidity into the pool next week, marking a strong step toward fostering deeper market activity and adoption.\n\n## Motivation\n\n>This proposal aims to add one new veBAL gauge.\n>\n>GHO/PYUSD E-CLP - Range: -60bps to 15bps\n\n## Specification\n\n\n#### Governance:\n\n>AAVE, aAAVE, and stkAAVE function as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO, empowering holders to participate in the decision-making process. Token holders can cast their votes on proposals via Snapshot for off-chain signaling and through the Aave DAO’s on-chain governance portal for binding decisions.\n\n#### Oracles:\n\n>- [Chainlink GHO/USD data feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/gho-usd) \"0x3f12643D3f6f874d39C2a4c9f2Cd6f2DbAC877FC\"\n>- [Chainlink PYUSD/USD data feed](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/pyusd-usd) \"0x8f1dF6D7F2db73eECE86a18b4381F4707b918FB1\"\n\n#### Audits:\n\n**Aave v3**\n\n>- [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf)\n>- [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf)\n>- [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf)\n>- [Peckshield](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf)\n>- [SigmaPrime](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3.pdf)\n\n**GHO**\n\n>- [Certora](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/2024-06-11_UpgradeableGHO_Certora.pdf)\n>- [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/2023-07-06_SigmaPrime.pdf)\n>- [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/2023-03-01_ABDK.pdf)\n>- [OpenZeppelin-v2](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/2022-11-10_Openzeppelin-v2.pdf)\n>- [OpenZeppelin-v1](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/2022-08-12_Openzeppelin-v1.pdf)\n\n**PYUSD**\n\n>- [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract/blob/master/audit-reports/Trail_of_Bits_Audit_Report.pdf)\n>- [Historical database of monthly attestations](https://paxos.com/pyusd-transparency/)\n\nOn the off-chain side, Paxos collaborates with Withum, a nationally recognized audit firm, to deliver timely monthly attestations verifying the reserves backing PYUSD.\n\n#### Centralization vectors\n\n>Aave Governance operates in a decentralized manner, with all changes undergoing a transparent and rigorously tested governance process.\n>\n>In contrast, Paxos functions as a centralized entity similar to Circle, the issuer of USDC, with its governance framework dictated exclusively by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\n>\n>Every PYUSD token is issued on a 1:1 basis, fully backed by reserves held in cash or U.S. Government Treasuries. These reserves are maintained in bankruptcy-remote accounts, ensuring that customer funds are safeguarded under New York banking laws and cannot be used to satisfy Paxos’ liabilities.\n>\n>Regarding the E-CLP Pool type, the FTL Labs team’s multi-signature wallet currently retains specific administrative controls. These include the ability to pause the pool, adjust the swap fee, and configure the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\n\n>- [GHO](https://app.redstone.finance/app/token/GHO/)\n>- [PYUSD](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/pyusd-usd)\n\n#### Value\n\n>This pool is expected to drive meaningful TVL to Balancer. The assets within the pool are not yield bearing. However, the DAOs will generate revenue from receiving a portion of the swap fees.\n\n## Pool Details\n\n>- Link to the Pool: [0x8950E720eB51AF9709A86941345844134517bcF4](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x8950e720eb51af9709a86941345844134517bcf40002000000000000000006e9)\n>- Link to the Gauge: [0xAf1b4bfA0a69B9e669d925888b99741E15e37253](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaf1b4bfa0a69b9e669d925888b99741e15e37253)\n\n## Kill Legacy PYUSD/GHO Gauge\n\n>We propose deprecating the existing gauge for the GHO/PYUSD pool, as both the market dynamics and the strength of GHO and PYUSD have significantly evolved. The pool’s calibration is no longer aligned with these changes, and maintaining it may create confusion for depositors. Disabling this outdated gauge will streamline user engagement and better reflect the current market landscape.\n>\n>Here are the links to the [pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x4c4ed61d81f531dcb34ad4d498548917aba3d193000200000000000000000680) and [gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb71C90F165cf99d4004499fF058E265Aa68fAC85) to kill. \n\n## Disclosure\n>\n>This proposal is the work of TokenLogic and karpatkey who are both Service Providers and delegates within the Aave Ecosystem.",

The calibration was improved over the previously deployed, equivalent pool that was whitelisted [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-691-enable-gauge-for-gyd-wsteth-e-clp-arbitrum/5956).\n\n**Specification**\n \n>1. **Governance:** The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.

        "body": "PR With Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1339\n\n**Summary**\n> This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge on Gnosis Chain for an sDAI/aUSDC.e E-CLP. \n\n**References/Useful links**\n\n> Links\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\n> * aUSDC.e is the deposit receipt token issued by the Aave protocol to lenders of bridged USDC. Since aTokens are rebasing, this pool uses BGD Labs’s statA wrapper that is a repricing representation of statA tokens that reflects the accruing lending yield.\n> * Savings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized, yield-bearing representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO.\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\n> Gyroscope is launching further strategic pools.\n\n**Specification**\n \n>1. **Governance:** The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n>\n>\n>2. **Oracles:** \n> * ‘rateProvider0’: sDAI rate provider on Gnosis Chain: [0x89C80A4540A00b5270347E02e2E144c71da2EceD](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x89C80A4540A00b5270347E02e2E144c71da2EceD)\nand relevant [review ](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/SavingsDAIRateProviderGnosis.md).\n> *  ‘rateProvider1’: aUSDC.e rate provider on Gnosis Chain: [0x5F62fd24941B585b91EB059E0ea1a7e729357511](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x5F62fd24941B585b91EB059E0ea1a7e729357511) \n>\n>3. **Audits:** Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production since November 2022.\n>\n>4. **Centralization vectors:** No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n>\n>5. **Market History:** This is the first sDAI/aUSDC.e E-CLP on Gnosis Chain.\n>\n>6. **Value:** This pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s). \n\n#### Contracts\n\n> * E-CLP: [0xaa56989Be5E6267fC579919576948DB3e1F10807](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xaa56989Be5E6267fC579919576948DB3e1F10807)\n>* Child Chain Gauge on Gnosis Chain: [0x9ED250d67c4E5F5B2b5F982a678eD1c0ba011207](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x9ED250d67c4E5F5B2b5F982a678eD1c0ba011207)\n>* Root Chain Gauge: [0xc0b75da8E6F6403804EFEFDE3101b02276C5f8EA](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc0b75da8E6F6403804EFEFDE3101b02276C5f8EA)\n\n\n#### Specification\n\n\n>Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>gauge(address): `0xc0b75da8E6F6403804EFEFDE3101b02276C5f8EA`\n>gaugeType(string): `Gnosis`",
