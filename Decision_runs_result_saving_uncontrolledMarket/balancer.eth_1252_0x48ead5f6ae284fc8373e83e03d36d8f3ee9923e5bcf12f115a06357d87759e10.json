Attending these events will help us improve brand visibility, establish thought leadership, showcase technological innovations, foster valuable networking opportunities, and deepen community engagement.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Motivation\n\nIn-person events are crucial for building and maintaining valuable relationships within the crypto community. They provide unique opportunities to present our latest developments, engage with thought leaders, and gather insights directly from our user base and potential partners. Specifically, the launch of Balancer v3 requires heightened visibility and strategic engagement to amplify its reach and aid adoption. Attending these events will provide Balancer with unparalleled opportunities to promote v3, build strategic partnerships, and engage with our community. This is a cost-effective approach to maximize our marketing efforts and ensure the successful launch of Balancer v3.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Goals and Objectives\n\nTo maximize our impact at live events, we have narrowed our focus to four key areas:\n\n### Brand Visibility and Thought Leadership\n\n- **Objective:** Enhance Balancer's brand presence and position the protocol as a thought leader in DeFi.\n- **Actions:** Engage in key speaking opportunities, contribute to panel discussions on future trends, and share insights on DeFi's evolution. (CEO, CTO)\n\n### Showcase Technological Innovation\n\n- **Objective:** Demonstrate the capabilities, benefits, and new features of Balancer v3.\n- **Actions:** Host workshops, curate hackathons, participate in panels, and coordinate events with key partners. (Blabs, Maxis)\n\n### Networking and Partnerships\n\n- **Objective:** Establish and strengthen relationships with developers, potential partners, and other influential players in the crypto industry.\n- **Actions:** Attend networking events, host side events and social meet-ups to foster relationships with key prospects. (Maxis, Marketing)\n\n### Community Engagement\n\n- **Objective:** Deepen engagement with the crypto community and gather valuable insights.\n- **Actions:** Host meet-ups, participate in social events, leverage social media and branded merchandise for engagement and giveaways. (Marketing)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Specification\n\n### Event Participation Plan\n\nWe propose to attend the following key events:\n\n- **ETHCC (July 8 - 11):**\nETHCC presents an opportunity for us to sow the seeds of connection for community and partnership goals. Rather than focusing on speaking at the main event, our goal is to organize social events and invest energy in grassroots networking. This event will also help us identify areas for improvement for future events.\n- **Token2049 (September) and Devcon (November):**\nFor these events, we will focus on establishing thought leadership by participating in key speaking opportunities and organizing a panel event with key partners to heighten awareness around v3 and its technology. Additionally, we will organize social events to complement the main activities. The goal is to align our impact with the launch of v3 and have ample time to prepare speakers and official events.\n\n### Key Activities\n\n- **ETHCC:ETHCC:**\n    - **Host a Side Event with Key Guests:**\n        - We will organize a side event featuring both prominent guests building on Balancer such as Gyro, CowSwap, and Quant, as well as notable partners such as Aave, Lido, Rocket Pool, Karpatkey. This gathering will provide a unique platform to bring together influential figures and key partners within the Balancer ecosystem.\n    - **Activities:**\n        - **Networking:** Facilitate informal networking sessions to help attendees connect with industry leaders and peers. This will provide opportunities for meaningful discussions and potential collaborations.\n        - **Social Events:** Organize social activities that encourage relaxed and personal interactions, allowing participants to build stronger, more personal connections.\n        - Merchandise: Enhance our presence and create lasting impressions with branded merchandise that capture the essence of the Balancer brand.\n- **Token2049 and Devcon:**\n    - **Key Contributors and Panel Discussions:**\n        - **Arrange for Key Contributors to Speak:** We will ensure that influential voices from Balancer, participate in speaking opportunities. Their insights and expertise will highlight Balancer v3's innovations and impact on the DeFi space.\n        - **Host Panel Discussions with Key Partners:** Collaborate with leading projects like Gyro, CowSwap, and Quant to organize panel discussions around protocols building on Balancer. These panels will focus on the advancements of Balancer v3 and its role in the broader DeFi ecosystem, providing a platform for thought leadership and in-depth discussions.\n    - **Hackathons:**\n        - **Participate in Hackathons:** Potentially engage in hackathons during Token2049 and Devcon to demonstrate Balancer v3's technical prowess and encourage innovative uses of our platform. Our team will be available to support participants, answer questions, and provide guidance on integrating Balancer’s technology.\n        - **Host a Balancer-Sponsored Hackathon:** Organize a Balancer-specific hackathon challenge to incentivize developers to build on top of Balancer v3. Winners can receive rewards and recognition, promoting creativity and highlighting the versatility of our platform.\n    - **Additional Social Events:**\n        - **Engage with the Wider Community:** Host informal social events, such as meet-and-greets, dinners, and networking mixers, to foster personal connections and engage with the DeFi community. These gatherings will provide a relaxed environment for meaningful interactions and relationship-building.\n        \n    ---\n    \n### 5. Implementation\n\n### Rough Timeline\n\n- **May - June:** Finalize event plans, secure speakers, and coordinate logistics.\n- **July:** Attend ETHCC, host side event.\n- **August - September:** Prepare for Token2049, develop presentation materials, and confirm participation.\n- **September:** Attend Token2049, and engage in speaking opportunities and panels.\n- **October - November:** Prepare for Devcon, and finalize hackathon details.\n- **November:** Attend Devcon, and participate in hackathons and panels.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Budget Considerations\n\nBelow is a rough budget for participation at ETHCC:\n\n| Category | Item | Cost per Unit (EUR) | Quantity | Total Cost (EUR) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tickets | Event Ticket (standard price) | 750 | 10 | 7,500 |\n| Travel | Flights/Trains (per person) | 1,000 | 10 | 10,000 |\n| Accommodation | Hotel (3-4 star, 5 nights) | 1250 | 10 | 12,500 |\n| Promo and Merch | Branded Merchandise | 5000 | 1 | 5,000 |\n| Social Events | Hosting Side Events | 10,000 | 1 | 10,000 |\n| Miscellaneous | Per Diem | 75 | 10 | 750 |\n| Total | Estimated Total | - | - | 45,750 |\n\n**Note:** The subsequent events would follow a similar budget structure, with potential adjustments based on our experiences at EthCC.\n\n---\n\n### **7. Specific Ask for Funding**\n\nWe are requesting funding from the Balancer DAO to cover the costs associated with attending these key events. The estimated total budget for ETHCC is 45,750 EUR, and we anticipate similar costs for Token2049 and Devcon, adjusted for any improvements based on our ETHCC experience. This funding will cover accommodations, event tickets, per diem costs, transportation, promotional materials, expenses related to hosting social events, and hackathon participation.\n\nOpCo will manage all payments and spending related to these events, ensuring efficient use of funds. The required budget will be sourced from the unallocated grants held by OpCo, ensuring that the expenditure aligns with our overall financial planning and support for the Balancer community.\n\nAdditionally, any unspent funds from these allocations will be rolled over to future events or initiatives, ensuring continued support and financial prudence in our promotional activities.\n\nBy securing this funding, we aim to maximize our impact at these events, promoting Balancer v3, fostering new partnerships, and enhancing our engagement with the DeFi community.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Success, Reporting, and Improvement\n\n### Reporting\n\nAfter each event, we will provide a detailed report to the Balancer DAO that includes:\n\n- Summary of activities and participation.\n- Key outcomes and metrics.\n- Photos and videos from the events.\n- Financial report detailing the actual expenses.\n\n### Continuous Improvement\n\nBased on the feedback and experiences from each event, we will:\n\n- Identify areas for improvement for future events.\n- Adjust our strategy and activities to maximize impact.\n- Share best practices and lessons learned with the community.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Conclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to secure funding for Balancer's strategic participation in key live events. By enhancing our presence at these events, we aim to significantly contribute to the successful launch of Balancer v3 and strengthen our position in the DeFi.\n\n**Specification**:\n\nNo technical specification required as funding will be supported by OpCo in this scenario; not interacting with the DAO Multisig directly.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/308\n\nHello Balancer Community!\n\nHistorically Orb has included the cost of our ONsites into its funding requests. We’ve decided to change that and request a separate, standalone proposal for these events starting with the one we are hoping to have in Q4 of this year. I know it might seem super early to start planning for this, but fear not, we are right on time. We need to get started on location selection because hotel blocks for groups of our size fill up many months in advance.\n\nWe are requesting 93,750 USDC to pay for 25 attendees:\n\n* Maxis: 7\n* Beethoven: 3\n* Integrations (Orbies): 3\n* Grants: 1\n* Foundation: 2\n* OpCo: 5\n* Other Ecosystem Contributors: 4\n\nBalancer Labs will pay for the costs of its attendees.\n\nAs a reminder, the goals of our ecosystem ONsites are to facilitate 1) in-person brainstorms and collaboration meetings and 2) team bonding. We have found the optimal cadence for in-person gatherings to be twice per year. Gathering the ecosystem together in person to discuss, debate and learn from things that went well and didn’t go well over the last six months has proven to be super valuable.\n\nThe agenda for each ONsite includes a Retrospective Meeting to review the last 6 months of work across the ecosystem), a Funding Meeting to plan the roadmap of projects that the ecosystem will work on in the next 6 months, and meetings that are reflective on what’s timely at the time of the event (ie, KPIs, marketing, regulatory, technical vision, mission/vision/values). Having the space and time to hold these meetings in person has been significantly more impactful for our team than having them virtually. In-person meetings allow more fluid conversations and attendees are more likely to build positive relationships through them. Contributors are also able to collaboratively brainstorm easier in person rather than virtually.\n\nHere is some feedback that we received in our follow-up survey after our Q4 2022 ONsite:\n\n* “ONsites are a must for remote-first companies.” - BLabs contributor\n* “Getting to know everyone personally [was my favorite part]. It created an even better feeling when doing video calls now.” - BLabs contributor\n* “Being able to meet the smart contracts team and ask them some questions [was my favorite part].” - OpCo contributor\n* “The organization was great overall and I’ve really enjoyed the experience and getting to know my co-contributors in person :)” - BLabs contributor\n* “We were reasonably frugal.” - BLabs contributor\n* “It was an amazing experience.” - Orb contributor\n* “I found that just a sole opportunity to meet the team and exchange ideas was very valuable.” - BLabs contributor\n\nWe are asking for funding based on our best estimate of what the total ecosystem headcount will be in Q4. If we have more attendees than what we budgeted for, we will need to request additional funding. If we have less, we will return excess funds to the OpCo. It’s worth noting that if that additional funding is not approved we won’t be able to invite new ecosystem members to this ONsite.\n\nWe are estimating that each attendee will cost 3,750 USDC for our five day/four night event. Breakdown of this cost:\n\n* Travel (Flights/Airport Transfers): 1,229 USDC/person\n* Overnight Accommodations: 928 USDC/person\n* Meeting Room Rentals: 82 USDC/person\n* Meals: 594 USDC/person\n* Activities: 332 USDC/person\n* Misc Expenses (ie, covid tests, meeting supplies, etc): 27 USDC/person\n* Canvas Meetings organizer fee: 399 USDC/person\n  * Includes sourcing, contracting, pre-planning, budget management, food & beverage management, vendor and all event logistics management.\n* ONsite event coordinator: 159 USDC/person\n  * Includes 24/7 dedication to our group ensuring everything goes smoothly from start to finish of the event. They monitor and assist with incoming and outgoing travel and make sure that all meetings, meals and activities are set up correctly and go on without a hitch.\n\nWhen planning these events we are always looking for ways to achieve our goals with a cost conscious lens on. Examples of this are not covering costs for flight upgrades and a mix of per diem meals and shared meals versus all shared meals. The Q4 event will be no different. For any funds that aren’t used for this event, we will keep those in our ONsite account and apply it to the next one.\n\nEdit:\n\nThis a capped budget and funds will flow directly through OpCo and OpCo’s wallet. Unused funds can be returned to Treasury. With Orb sunsetting, organization will be handled by Maxis together with OpCo for logistics and BLabs for their own contributors.\n\nIf approved, DAO Treasury 0x10a19e7ee7d7f8a52822f6817de8ea18204f2e4f will transfer 93,750 USD to OpCo's wallet 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 to cover ONsite expenses\n\nOpCo’s multisig to receive funds: 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/703/files\n\n## Intro\n\nRemote work is great! Gives everyone a lot of flexibility and comfort to work from wherever we want. Either in a remote location away from the busy urban life, or close to home with family and friends nearby, I can speak for all Balancer contributors and say we are most thankful for collaborating in a thriving ecosystem that knows no borders or boundaries. We love web3!\n\nHowever, in-person interactions are the best! Speaking from experience, being present in the past three Balancer ONsite editions (Bogotá, Barcelona and Milan), there’s no doubt there is great value in these irl events. Our last meetup in [Milan ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-348-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q4-2023/4700)was an absolute success by kickstarting Balancer V3 work, and now we are set to plan our next interaction in Lisbon, to wrap up and launch V3 to the world.\n\nThis proposal requests budget allocation from the Treasury to fund expenses for DAO contributors (service providers and other key participants) for a week-long meetup filled with activities alongside Balancer Labs contributors.\n\nOrganizing an event is not effortless. As part of the ecosystem liaison role, the Maxis will be taking over this activity (together with BLabs). Time is of the essence, as hotels need to block big sized groups like ours in advance, and flights are never cheap.\n\nWe are currently estimating the event at 3,350 euros per person, allocating 84.755.00 USDC for 23 attendees.\n\n* Balancer Maxis: 7\n* Beethoven X: 5\n* Balancer Foundation: 2\n* Balancer OpCo: 5\n* Other Ecosystem Contributors: 5\n\nBalancer OpCo still holds 38,280.95 USDC from last edition’s budget, so are requesting to top up 46,474.05 USDC. Any unused budget will be kept at OpCo for future use, as governance may direct. Balancer Labs will pay for the costs of its (15) guests, and common expenses will be split proportionally. The total expense/allocation is still well below our projections made in Q3 ($93,750 for [reference](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-dao-q3-financial-report-and-year-2-3-funding-impact-analysis/5279))\n\nYou can check [last edition’s proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-348-ecosystem-onsite-proposal-q4-2023/4700) for more info.\n\n$23,320.00 Travels and Airport Transfers\n$23,494.40 Accommodations\n$10,890.00 Food and Beverage (including Welcome Reception and Farewell Dinner)\n$3,371.59 Meeting Room expenses\n$7,260.00 Activities\n$5,232.00 Travel agent (including on-site staff expenses, flights and accommodation)\n\n## Learnings\n\nHelping to plan the last Milan ONsite after Orb’s demise, we have learned that big group events are not necessarily cheaper, and we might not find “bulk price” for suppliers like hotels, restaurants, and activities. On the contrary, these vendors might look at events like this as an opportunity to get “full-price” sales instead of discounted retail prices we see on websites.\n\nFurthermore, we found it necessary to have a travel agent with some expertise assisting in this process. We were, however, unhappy with Canva (our contracted service provider for past editions), as their deliverables were not up to their fees and commissions. Alongside Balancer Labs, we are moving to another agent, who is also specialized in corporate events but offers lower fees overall.\n\nNeedless to say, we will make great effort to bring down the values presented here, as negotiations with suppliers are just getting started. These are initial quotes and estimates. The Maxis have a proven track record of successfully fighting unnecessary expenditures and championing savings across the board.\n\nIt is our intent to get it below 3k euros per person, but we also want our contributors to feel good about coming to these meetups. We understand they are leaving their families for the week and most of them are flying long distances (no business class tickets!), so bonding and comfort are also very important to us!\n\n## Specification\n\nThe DAO multisig on Ethereum 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will send 46,474.05 USDC to Balancer OpCo’s wallet 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693",

This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (January 1, 2024 - June 30, 2024). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a [separate proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xx-funding-proposal-for-the-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-sp-jan-jun-24/5406).\n\nOur primary roles include API team lead (franz), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). While the past nine months have been turbulent at times, we strongly believe it has once again demonstrated the resilience of the Balancer DAO and the entire ecosystem. Despite a [key service provider winding down](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-orb-collective-s-path-forward/4778), several core contributors stepping down, and a [critical vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-found-in-some-pools/5102), we are collectively still here, building.\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for Balancer to regain narrative and establish ourselves as the platform to empower current and future AMM innovation. We are hugely optimistic in the future of Balancer Protocol and steadfast in our dedication to support the ecosystem to the best of our abilities. As we work towards Balancer V3, it has been inspiring to participate in the development of a more cohesive technology stack to empower the future of the protocol. A technology stack that leverages the collective experiences and expertise of contributors across the ecosystem, avoiding siloed development strategies that lead to unnecessary system complexity in Balancer V2.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broader ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. As we continue to find the best way to bring value to the Balancer ecosystem, we welcome community feedback.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nThree Rocks recently [announced](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/integrations-team-three-rocks-november-2023-update/5408) their decision to wind down effective December 2023. Both @rabmarut and @gerg have been long time contributors to the Balancer ecosystem. We’d like to extend a thank you to the entire Three Rocks organization, they are a team of talented engineers who made countless contributions to the protocol as well as serving as the technical interface to external partners, they will be missed. \n\nOver the last few months, there has been ecosystem wide discussions around the future of integrations at Balancer, resulting in with what we see as a very positive outcome to a challenging situation. Effective January 2024, the responsibilities of the integrations team will transition to Balancer Labs under the leadership of John Grant. With John Grant’s extensive knowledge of the entire Balancer ecosystem and the support of existing Three Rocks team member @Mkflow27, integrations will become a part of what is currently the Balancer Labs SDK team. With expertise in both on- and off-chain integrations into Balancer Protocol, we see this team as being well suited to fill the gap left by Three Rocks. While John is on a well deserved parental leave, I have been working directly with mkflow to help facilitate a smooth transition.\n\nWe’d additionally like to extend a huge thanks to Fernando and the entire Balancer Labs team for their willingness to take on the responsibilities and costs for integrations moving forward. This significantly reduces the operational costs incurred by the DAO, and is yet another example of Balancer Labs' ongoing commitment to the long-term success of the Balancer protocol.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nBalancer V3 has been the core focus of the Smart Contracts team for the majority of the last two quarters. While the feature set has not yet been publicly disclosed, we are extremely excited about the technical direction of Balancer V3. Architecturally speaking, there has been a focus on:\n\n- Interface design - with the overarching goal of making it significantly easier to integrate with Balancer protocol.\n- Reducing overall system complexity\n- Improved code readability by reducing inheritance depth and leveraging libraries for composition.\n\nInternally, the smart contracts team is on track to complete its second major milestone at the end of this year, a first MVP of the core contracts of Balancer V3. It has been an absolute pleasure collaborating closely with @juani, @endymionjkb and @ylv. I think I can speak for the entire team when I say that we’re very much looking forward to sharing more details on Balancer V3 publicly.\n\n**SDK**\n\nProgress on the new [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) has continued over the past two quarters, and it is fast approaching feature complete for Balancer V2. In contrast to the existing [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk), the new b-sdk is highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API, allowing the SDK to be focused in its goals. The SDK team has additionally been a huge contributor in interface design for Balancer V3, their in-depth understandings of V2 integration pain points have been invaluable in the process.\n\nAn important initiative worth highlighting is the cross-organizational effort to implement a generalized approach for [price impact calculations](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk/blob/d8dc287253160d20c877a57ac4c4c60190b22770/src/entities/priceImpact/index.ts) in the b-sdk. Spearheaded by @brunoguerios from the SDK team and @ZenDragon from the Maxis, their efforts have produced a first iteration of a generalized approach that will reliably calculate price impact for all pool actions, irrespective of the underlying invariant implementation. This is a massively valuable development for the entire ecosystem.\n\n**Frontend**\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for a new take on the existing frontend application. OpCo and Beethoven X contributors have spent the last several months laying the groundwork on a new version of the Balancer Frontend. With a fresh new look, the new Balancer Product will be:\n\n- Multi-chain native to allow for quick exploration of liquidity pools across all Balancer supported networks.\n- API powered to facilitate fast loading times, overcoming many of the data challenges plaguing the current V2 application.\n- Version agnostic to ensure that any liquidity that stays on V2 will benefit from the streamlined UX.\n- Designed with a flexible architecture, with the goal to easily support all current and future pool types.\n\nLed by @gareth, OpCo and Beethoven X contributors are collectively leveraging their extensive Balancer domain knowledge to build a better product.\n\n**API**\n\nAs the limitations of the subgraph have been a constant bottleneck for V2, the Balancer Labs Data team, lead by @mendesfabio, have made the decision that future versions of the Balancer subgraph will be focused primarily on data extraction (E). This is in recognition that the API is better suited for the role of data transformation (T) and loading (L). As the API will play an important role in the Balancer tech stack, former SDK team member Jarek has transitioned to the API team and we expect that there will be a close collaboration between the API and Data teams as we move towards Balancer V3.\n\nBelow, we present general API updates, written by Beethoven X DAO contributor franz, API team lead:\n\nOver the last months, our main effort went into getting the API ready for the new frontend-v3 and the b-sdk. As the frontend aims to serve a multi-chain user experience, the API must also support these requirements. Working closely together with OpCo, requirements for queries have been defined and implemented one-by-one as they are needed in the development process. \n\nMany other, smaller changes have also been integrated into the API to support data needs for the new frontend such as specific filters, rate provider data, FX pools support or yield fee specifics.\n\nAdditionally, the API is also used in the new b-sdk to “enrich” pool data that is being used for various pool operations. Together with Balancer Labs we defined the requirements for the API and integrated the changes. These requirements mainly comprise specific needs on nested pools, token indexes or other token data.\n\nAdditional points of interest:\n\n- In August, BASE chain was integrated into the API which is responsible for serving pricing data to the UI.\n- Optimizations have been made to the infrastructure deployment that resulted in a more cost effective solution. In addition, more changes are planned that should further reduce the cost of operating the infrastructure.\n- On November 27th, we successfully deprecated the veBal voting-gauges.json file in GitHub in favor of the API. All known partners have migrated and will query the API in the future. With this change we automate a manual operations task, reducing manual work.\n- We have helped the community in Discord with questions regarding development, inner workings of the UI and API, to help them understand the liquidity mining or voting processes from Balancer and with general questions.\n- We’ve supported the Balancer Maxis with their data needs for the gauge rewards automation program. Also, showcasing the rich data set that the API has on Balancer pools and how to make use of it.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort. How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n- **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting January 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2023.\n\nWe request a budget of $29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory. The increase of $4,000 USDC per month reflects increased involvement from groninge on the development of the new v3 frontend.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

This proposal seeks to extend the technical services and advisory component of the original proposal for an additional 5 month period (August 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023). As outlined in [BIP-314](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810), the marketing component of [BIP-254](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-254-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao/4652) will appear as a separate proposal moving forward. \n\nThe following sections present a summary of where we spent our time and energy over the last 10 weeks. As we continue to find the best way to bring value to the Balancer ecosystem, we welcome community feedback.\n\n**API**\n\nThe new [Balancer API](https://api-v3.balancer.fi/) is production ready, supporting all Balancer and Beethoven X chains. Built to alleviate many of the data sourcing issues plaguing the balancer frontend, this new API leverages the [beethovenx-backend](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/beethovenx-backend/) codebase and is deployed on unified infrastructure. This joint deployment cuts operational costs and allows us to tap into individual domain expertise more effectively.\n\nAs the API will become a critical piece of infrastructure for Balancer protocol, we dedicated substantial effort to enhancing monitoring and ensuring operational resilience. To improve error visibility, we implemented various alerting mechanisms and notification services, enabling us to identify and address any potential issues before they affect users. Additionally, we created a status page ([Dashboard](https://cloudwatch.amazonaws.com/dashboard.html?dashboard=status-page-main-share&context=eyJSIjoidXMtZWFzdC0xIiwiRCI6ImN3LWRiLTExODY5NzgwMTg4MSIsIlUiOiJ1cy1lYXN0LTFfNkhUUlp3VENaIiwiQyI6IjRlazJtOHJvMXRxYWI5NTdpazJwMG9odTNmIiwiSSI6InVzLWVhc3QtMTo5OThhODFjZC0xYWJhLTRkNmItYjBlNi1iYTJmMzk2YzM5YTMiLCJPIjoiYXJuOmF3czppYW06OjExODY5NzgwMTg4MTpyb2xlL3NlcnZpY2Utcm9sZS9DV0RCU2hhcmluZy1QdWJsaWNSZWFkT25seUFjY2Vzcy1UUEg1NEpVWSIsIk0iOiJQdWJsaWMifQ%3D%3D&start=PT3H&end=null)) that provides real-time infrastructure status for anyone to monitor.\n\nTo strengthen the resiliency of the API, we implemented several measures, most notably integrating caching infrastructure and adding rate limits. Furthermore, the deployment architecture is designed to scale automatically based on demand. These implementations ensure that the API can reliably and efficiently handle requests, leading to a fast and seamless user experience.\n\nBeyond infrastructure changes, we’ve collaborated closely with contributors from OpCo and Balancer Labs to further enhance the API and align it with the requirements of the Balancer Protocol.\n\n- Leveraging the token pricing mechanism of the API, OpCo successfully improved pricing reliability on the frontend. It proved particularly valuable during the ZKEVM deployment, where Coingecko lacked many token prices.\n- The API is now used to provide real-time \"marketing stats\" on the Balancer landing page, aggregating total volume, fees, and TVL across all chains efficiently.\n- In collaboration with OpCo, we’ve started integrating the veBAL voting list into the API, leading us to uncover and optimize inefficiencies in the voting gauge addition process. By streamlining and automating these processes, we can significantly enhance their efficiency by reducing manual work.\n- Working closely with the SDK team, we’ve started to integrate the new version of the [SOR](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) into the API. Leveraging our existing production deployment and the API's capabilities, we are able to test the new SOR algorithm using real-time swap data. This approach allows us to evaluate the efficiency and speed of the swap, helping us improve the SOR code and achieve optimal outcomes.\n\nThrough collaboration, enhanced infrastructure, and integration efforts, we have established a robust and reliable API that caters to the needs of both Balancer and Beethoven X. However, we recognize that this is just the beginning of our journey.\n\n**Technical Advisory**\n\nA key takeaway from the initial engagement period facilitated by Balancer Labs is that the role I (daniel) am best suited to fill is not only as a builder but as an advisor across the technical landscape, working to ensure that the various engineering teams in the ecosystem build cohesive technology that is aligned with the overall Balancer product vision.\n\nOutlined below is where I’ve spent the bulk of my time and energy, although I would emphasize that I am just one part of a larger conversation. I’m hugely thankful for everyone’s openness in engaging with me on these topics.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nOne common criticism of Balancer protocol smart contracts is that they are difficult to interact with and even harder to understand. Although the smart contract team does an incredible job of documenting their contracts, there is a collective agreement that we can improve their ease-of-use and readability.\n\nThere is real value in “giving people what they’re used to” as a means to facilitate adoption. While the Balancer V2 interfaces make sense in the context of balancer, they introduce domain specific knowledge that create hurdles for adoption. We’ve started working on a simple set of interfaces that more closely align with the standards set by Uni V2. These interfaces will provide an alternative to the existing full-fledged options (`batchSwap, joinPool, exitPool`).\n\nWhile inheritance is the core design pattern available when organizing smart contracts, deep inheritance comes at the tradeoff of readability. The use of libraries has been presented as an alternative to inheritance (where appropriate). When a library function is called, it’s immediately obvious where that function is defined, and thus easier to understand and reason about. It more closely tracks the principle of *composition over inheritance*.\n\n**SDK**\n\nTo date, the [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk) has been built primarily to facilitate the needs of the [Balancer Frontend](https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v2). The introduction of the [B-SDK](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) and [Balancer API](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/beethovenx-backend/) present an opportunity for us to redefine it’s role in the broader tech stack. It allows us to ask the question: “What role should the Balancer SDK play in facilitating/furthering the overall vision of Balancer Protocol?”\n\nIn answering this question, we’ve worked on identifying the various user groups of the Balancer SDK and prioritizing their needs. This has allowed us to more clearly define that the Balancer SDK should be a tool highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. The Balancer API will serve as the data hub for the protocol, allowing us to move much of the data responsibilities out of the SDK and into the API.\n\nActive initiatives:\n\n- The new SOR (implemented in the B-SDK) has been integrated into the API, allowing for side-by-side testing of the routing algorithms without adding additional computational load to the frontend.\n- Various read-only helper contracts are in development: [1](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/pull/2521), [2](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-deployments/pull/54), [3](https://github.com/balancer/helpers). These contracts will significantly reduce the complexity of off-chain data processing, providing accessible on-chain tooling for common data requirements. This aligns with an over arching goal to push more data complexity (where it makes sense) on-chain.\n- @brunoguerios from the SDK team has started porting additional pool type math to the new B-SDK SOR, leveraging the computationally superior bigint math.\n\n**Frontend (Product)**\n\nThe change from “frontend” to “product” represents a subtle but important shift in how we think about the Balancer frontend. Some general thoughts on a Balancer Product vision are presented [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882/22). @gareth and I continue to have an ongoing conversation focused on how we can build a better Balancer Product both technically and within it’s role in facilitating the growth and adoption of the Balancer Protocol.\n\nIn an effort to ensure that we are constantly improving the existing UX, we’ve begun to set up a process that creates visibility around issues in the existing balancer frontend. Our goal is to use existing tools to measure user issues when interacting with the balancer frontend, and work towards reducing these occurrences over time.\n\n**Composable Stable Pool Vulnerability Support**\n\nThe [vulnerability disclosure on June 25th](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1672635756005957633) has impacted protocol fee collection on all composable stable pools, a core revenue driver for the protocol. As resolution of this issue was deemed critically important, I’ve invested a significant portion of the last two weeks supporting @juani and @Fernando in identifying the underlying issue and working towards a resolution. As someone familiar with the composable stable pool protocol fee collection mechanism, my participation here made sense from a resource allocation perspective, and has allowed the remainder of the smart contract team to continue progressing on existing projects.\n\n**Marketing Transition Support**\n\nAlthough not a typical technical service, when the Orb Collective [abruptly wound down support for marketing services](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-april-2023-high-level-updates/4735) and [released all marketing personnel](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-updated-q2-budget-forecast-5-12-23/4775), I stepped in to facilitate a smooth transition of marketing related responsibilities to [Beethoven X contributors](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810). \n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort.
