As extra protection, during the initial period of updates (estimated 1-2 months), BGD Labs will join the Risk Council multi-sig in order to add an additional layer of security review. *Chaos Labs will still be the only decision maker for recommendations as defined on their professional scope with the DAO, with us BGD just being a security contributor*.\n- The second is a pilot version to automate interest rate updates of assets (starting with WETH on Aave v3 Lido Ethereum), based on the newly released risk infrastructure technology Edge, by Chaos Labs.\n\nThe repository can be found on [https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards).\n\n---\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe base motivation of Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS) is still the same as the previously proposed version [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204). After a successful initial iteration for cap updates and different GHO parameters using the Stewards pattern, Aave is prepared to generalize the solution and improve its operational efficiency and reactivity to the market.\n\nRegarding the pilot integration of AGRS with Chaos Labs new Edge infrastructure, it has the following rationale:\n\n1. Whenever aligned with other strategic and technical aspects, Aave should benefit from infrastructure built by service providers, in this case, Chaos Labs.\n2. This pilot will be very non-invasive and with only positive outcomes, as the AGRS layer will guarantee that only acceptable interest rate recommendations will reach the Aave protocol, while ideally having a way more dynamic rate.\n\n---\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## 1. AGRS + Risk provider\n\nThe main version of AGRS will follow the specifications described in the previous Risk Stewards post [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204#specification-3), which can be summarised in the following:\n\n- The following risk params could be changed by the RiskStewards:\n    - Supply Caps\n    - Borrow Caps\n    - LTV\n    - Liquidation Threshold\n    - Liquidation Bonus\n    - Debt Ceiling\n    - Base variable borrow rate\n    - Slope 1\n    - Slope 2\n    - Optimal point\n    - CAPO configurations\n- For each configuration type, there will be a minimum delay associated with how frequently the AGRS can be used, named `minDelay`. Ex. after increasing LTV by 5%, the operator of the AGRS (risk provider) must wait a minimum of minDelay before either doing any additional change.\n- Each configuration type will have an associated percentage-based constraint (in basis points), indicating how much the parameter can be changed via AGRS compared to the live value on Aave v3. These constraints (`maxPercentChange`) can be of 2 types:\n    - *Absolute*. E.g. for LTV a 5_00 `maxPercentChange` means that is possible to change the LTV value by +/- 5_00 basis points, or 5%, compared to the current live value. So if the current LTV is 65%, it is possible to change up to 70% or down to 60%.\n    - *Relative*. E.g. for Supply Cap a 50_00 `maxPercentChange` means that is possible to change the Supply Cap value by +/- 50_00 basis points, or 50%, proportional to the current live param. So if the current Supply Cap is 1’000’000 WETH, it is possible to change it up to 1’500’000 WETH, or down to 500’000 WETH.\n- The system allows to restrict assets for AGRS to not apply changes, to be used for example with GHO.\n- The only entity enabled to use the AGRS will be the assigned risk service provider, currently Chaos Labs. As a temporary security precaution, and to avoid introducing a timelock (given that the system should be resilient enough without it), BGD will review the params updates proposed for correctness, but without any influence on the recommendation itself.\n\n\n---\n\n\nTo start with, this component of AGRS will have the following configurations (from recommendations of the risk provider of the community):\n\n| Parameter | Percent change allowed | minimumDelay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply and Borrow Caps | 100% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| Debt Ceiling | 20% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| CAPO dynamic cap | 5% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| CAPO stable cap | 0.5% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Slope 1 | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Slope 2 | 5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Optimal Point (Kink) | 3% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Loan to Value (LTV) | 0.25% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 0.25% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n\n\nThe principles for them in the initial phase are:\n- Still highly constraint in percentages and time, in order to not deposit too much trust to start with.\n- Similar as with caps updates, all usage of stewards will be previously disclosed on the Aave governance forum, by a framework to be defined by Chaos Labs, the risk provider in charge.\n\n\nAdditionally, the only blacklisted asset will be GHO on Ethereum, given that changes on it are usually done by the ALC (Aave Liquidity Committee) via the GHOSteward, or directly with governance proposals.\n\n---\n\n## 2. AGRS + Edge Infrastructure by Chaos Labs\n\nDays ago, the Aave risk service provider Chaos Labs [announced Edge](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/introducing-edge-the-next-generation-oracle),  a new product innovating on the risk infrastructure ecosystem.\n\nThis new system directly addresses a challenge for risk recommendations on Aave: how to connect as seamlessly as possible the platform of parameters recommendation run by Chaos during the last years for Aave, with the Aave protocol.\n\nWith this activation of AGRS pending, after evaluating the solution, and due to the already long contribution history of Chaos Labs, we decided that is a good opportunity to test out the usage of Edge for a specific parameter: Aave rates configurations for WETH on v3 Lido Ethereum.\n\nThis model will use another instance of AGRS (exactly the same codebase as the other model), but with the following constraints:\n\n- The AGRS + Edge instance will only have configurable rate-related parameters: base variable borrow rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2.\n- Recommendations of these parameters will be submitted to a risk oracle smart contract, from the Edge off-chain infrastructure.\n- Between the risk oracle smart contract and the AGRS contract, there will be a very thin middleware `AaveStewardsInjector` , which will have the following logic:\n    - Will take recommendations from the Edge Risk Oracle side and propagate them to the AGRS contract.\n    - Enforce that only the WETH asset can be acted upon.\n    - Given the protections (percentage constraints and time delay) on the AGRS side and that it is an assumption that risk recommendation will be the time correct on the Edge Risk Oracle, the propagation will be permissionless.\n\n\nRegarding the configurations of the AGRS + Edge instance, will be the following (for only WETH on v3 Lido Ethereum to start with):\n\n| Parameter | Percent change allowed | minimumDelay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate | 0.5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Slope 1 | 0.5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Slope 2 | 5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Optimal Point (Kink) | 3% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n\n\n## Security\n\nIn addition to our internal review and testing procedures, the AGRS have been reviewed by Certora, and the report can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards?tab=readme-ov-file#security)",

        "body": "&nbsp;\n\n## Simple summary\n\nProposal for the activation of Aave v3.1 as an upgrade on top of all active Aave v3 instances.\n\nThe codebase can be found on https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave v3 is a “living” DeFi protocol, which akin to any other software, receives upgrades over time on its different components. Sometimes, the improvements can be made in isolation in independent upgrades, for example, almost 1 year ago, we introduced a new 3.0.2 version 1, including only relatively minor changes and bug fixes.\n\nHowever, since 3.0.2, we had multiple other ideas on the backlog heavily focused on security and optimisation, that over time got validated due to security incidents on similar protocols and by observing operational overhead for Aave contributors (e.g. governance proposals changing parameters). As some of this features in some cases were dependent between each other, end of 2023 we decided to batch them together in a new major-minor Aave v3 version we propose for activation here: **Aave v3.1**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Specification\n\n### 3.1 scope\n\nv3.1 is clearly focused in 2 fields: redundant security and optimisation of the logic to reduce operational overhead.\nWith those principles in mind, the following is a summarised of the features/improvements included in the release (for extensive information, full specification can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-v3-1-and-aave-origin/17305#features-4)):\n\n1. Virtual accounting\n2. Stateful interest rate strategy\n3. Freezing by EMERGENCY_GUARDIAN on PoolConfigurator\n4. Reserve data update on rate strategy and RF (Reserve Factor) changes\n5. Minimum decimals for listed assets\n6. Liquidations grace sentinel\n7. LTV0 on freezing\n8. Permission-less movement of stable positions to variable\n9. Allow setting debt ceiling whenever LT is 0\n10. New getters on Pool and PoolConfigurator for library addresses\n11. Misc minor bug fixes and sync the codebase with the current v3 production\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Security\n\nThis 3.1 has undergone 3 different procedures, and optionally more are expected pre and post release:\n\n- Security review by [MixBytes](https://mixbytes.io/).\n- Security review by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), in addition to improved Certora properties since the v3 release.\n- Security review of the most critical feature (Virtual Accounting) by [StErMi](https://twitter.com/stermi).\n\nAll the reports will be added to the Aave v3.1. repository once finished.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe previous third-party procedures complement all the internal by BGD, that we apply to every codebase:\n\n- Testing of all the new features, and verifying/adapting that only intended consequences appear on previous Aave v3 features.\n- Gas implications.\n- Carefully verifying codebase and storage diffs to avoid any type of broken behaviour.\n- High-level operational implications, for example on procedures followed by other Aave contributors when doing governance proposals.\n\nAdditionally, the current Aave Immunefi bug bounty will be applicable to v3.1, once approved via governance and activated on production instances.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Upgrade procedure\n\nThe upgrade of v3 instances to v3.1 will be done same as any other Aave on-chain governance proposal: on each applicable network, an executable payload will do the appropriate implementations' upgrades together with any other intended setup.\n\nThe goal is to apply v3.1 on all active Aave v3 networks: Ethereum, Polygon PoS, Avalanche C-Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Metis, Scroll, Gnosis and BNBChain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Licensing\nAave v3.1 follows the same licensing approach as all other major contributions of BGD Labs as service provider of the Aave DAO: BUSL 1.1 licensed to the Aave governance smart contracts, explicitly forbidden the usage of the improved codebase in production by any entity competing with Aave.\n\nThe Aave DAO has full power to change this license however deemed appropriate in the future.\n\nThe full license can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Next steps\n- Pre-approval via this ARFC Snapshot for the upgrade of all Aave v3 instances to Aave v3.1.\n- In parallel, finish the preparations of the AIP payload for the upgrade, and any extra security procedure around it.",

        "body": "# Summary\nProposal to pre-approve the activation of Aave v3.2 across all Aave pool instances, a new version of v3 (currently v.3.1) including two important changes:\n\n- A new feature: Liquid eModes.\n- The removal of all deprecated stable rate logic.\n\n\n# Context\nJuly 27th, Aave governance proposal 132 3 activated Aave v3.1 across all active networks. This currently active version of the Aave protocol was focused on security improvements (e.g. introducing virtual accounting), changing the architecture of the interest rate strategies, and multiple other updates to improve the operational efficiency of the system.\n\nAdditionally, with Aave v3.1 we introduced Aave v3 Origin 4, a new repository for the Aave protocol (Foundry-based) to serve as the cornerstone to release further post-v3.1 versions faster while keeping maximum security standards.\n\nOne and a half months later, as a result of previous groundwork with v3.1 and Origin, we are glad to present to the community this new Aave v3.2 version.\n\n## Aave v3.2\nThe changes included in Aave v3.2 are more isolated than those of v3.1, and of different nature. While removing stable rate-related logic is more on the maintenance/codebase cleanup side, liquid eModes is a total user-facing and powerful feature.\n\n### 1 -  Liquid eModes\n\nAave v3 introduced the concept of eMode (efficiency mode), an abstraction within the pool for configuring groups of assets with more capital-efficient risk configurations (LTV, Liquidation Threshold). This unlocked use cases like native high-leverage or even strategies between stablecoins. eMode could be deemed one of the first experiments in DeFi at scale with the concept of pools of assets within pools of assets.\n\nThe eMode feature has seen since then tremendous success, enabling use cases like ETH-correlated eMode, allowing for higher than default risk parameters on ETH LSTs/ETH positions (or MATIC, AVAX with their LSTs). However, the eMode feature always had some room for improvement, that way truly unlocking even more powerful use cases and flexibility on Aave.\n\nA known technical limitation of the initial iteration of eMode is the following: a single eMode is optionally assigned to assets listed on Aave. That means that if let’s say WETH is assigned eMode 1 eligibility (ETH-correlated, with ETH LSTs), WETH can’t be eligible for any other eMode.\n\nIn different scenarios, this is an important constraint, as currently is not possible to have on the same Aave pool an eMode with wstETH and WETH, together with a different eMode with weETH and WETH, as WETH can only be in one of them at the same time.\n\n\n\nThe new Liquid eMode feature of Aave v3.2 removes the previous constraint: an asset listed on Aave can be eligible for different eModes, and then it only depends on the user to choose which eMode he wants to enter to.\n\nFor example, with liquid eModes, a possible configuration not doable before would be:\n\n- eMode 1, with wstETH, weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 2, with wstETH and WETH.\n- eMode 3, with weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 4, with WETH and GHO.\n\nSo then, user A holding the wstETH and weETH collaterals, could borrow WETH at high LTV. User B holding only wstETH could borrow WETH at high (but different) LTV. User C holding only weETH could similarly borrow WETH at a different LTV than the previous two eModes. User D could have a position with WETH collateral and GHO borrowings.\n\nThis doesn’t stop there, as more sophisticated configuration strategies could be adopted, like:\n\n- eMode for only WETH and stablecoins.\n- eMode for onboarding less mature LSTs, without requiring them being together with all major LSTs.\n\nFor extra configuration flexibility, liquid eModes also allow now to flag an asset as only borrowable, only collateral, or both, in the context of an eMode. For example, in a hypothetic eMode with only wstETH and WETH, the normal configuration would be wstETH as only collateral and WETH as only borrowable, fully focusing on the wstETH leverage use-case.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the previous main characteristics of liquid eModes, we have also introduced the following minor changes to the system:\n\n- Now the protocol doesn’t enforce the LTV/LT of an asset being lower outside its eligible eModes. However, the validation gets stricter on the user side when entering any eMode (or from no-eMode): Health Factor is always validated to never allow the user to get his position below 1HF post-eMode swap.\n- The protocol previously had an eMode-specific price feed, to be used to price with the same feed all assets on an eMode. However, this has never been used, and its utility (in its current form) is quite arguable. Therefore, we have to remove it from the data structure to allow more efficient storage allocation.\n- On a technical note, before 3.2, the eMode of an asset was stored on the asset’s data itself. Now, the eMode data stores all the necessary information for the protocol to understand which assets are eligible on that eMode.\n- Similar as with previous upgrades on Aave v3, we have tried to follow a non-invasive approach when adding the feature, only touching/refactoring those pieces that were clearly necessary, but without doing any big high-level refactoring of the pool.\n\n### 2 - Stable rate logic cleanup\n\nPart of the v.3.1 upgrade was the addition of a function swapToVariable() for anybody to permissionless off-board stable borrowings to variable, that way factually deprecating completely stable rate on Aave pools.\n\nWith currently no active stable rate position (moved via the Dolce Vita program by the service provider ACI 4), we have executed a follow-up step on the process: completely removing the stable rate logic from the protocol, which one hand simplifies the codebase, but on the other hand it also slightly optimises gas consumption and logic flows.\n\nEven if fairly extensive change, this cleanup is non-invasive in how the protocol operates given that there are no active stable rate positions. All technical details about it will be included in the upcoming v3.2 release technical changelog.\n\n## Security\nIn addition to all standard internal procedures on BGD Labs (testing, review), the external security processes are getting finished. Before the final AIP, they will be properly communicated in the Aave governance forum.\n\nSimilar as with any other Aave v3 upgrades, the AIP proposal will include compensation for the cost of the external security procedures.",

        "body": "**Author**: Jarvis Network Core Team\n**Forum post**: [Listing proposal: add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polyon](https://governance.aave.com/t/listing-proposal-add-jeur-on-aave-v3-on-polyon/7353)\n\n\n# Summary\nThe purpose of this AIP is to list Jarvis Network's jEUR, a synthetic euro stablecoins, on Aave V3 when it deploys on Polygon. jEUR is a liquid and capital-efficient Euro stablecoin collateralized with USDC, and with a working 0-fee fiat on and off-ramp. jEUR can be converted for USDC back and forth at the Chainlink price feed, granting it liquidity and peg on our primary market. jEUR is used by other Euro stablecoins on Polygon in Curve’s pools to help them with their own peg and liquidity.\n\n# About Jarvis Network\nSynthereum is the first protocol of the [Jarvis Network](https://jarvis.network). It provides a capital-efficient manner to issue and exchange synthetic fiat currencies called jFIATs, on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain, Avalanche, and the BNB Chain.\n\njFIATs’ main feature is their convertibility for their collateral (USDC on Polygon) and for other jFIATs at the oracle price, without price impact, enabling a 0-slippage on-chain Forex. This feature makes them usable: since one can convert them for USDC at any time, they keep their peg, and have the same market depth as USDC, and therefore are very liquid.\n\nThe protocol is integrated within Paraswap, so users can swap jEUR for any other token.\n\nWe have partnered with [Mt Pelerin](https://www.mtpelerin.com/), a Swiss regulated entity, to provide users with a 0-fee 1:1 fiat on and off-ramp, directly on Polygon (and other EVM chains). Anyone can go from their Euro bank account to jEUR on Polygon, back and forth. One can even pay invoices in Euros using jEUR (our company only uses jEUR to pay invoices, salaries, rent, and even taxes, since July last year).\n\nCombined with Paraswap, this partnership with Mt Pelerin creates a system that can replace CEX, and provide users with a way to buy any token on Polygon with Euros, at a better rate than most CEX (including Binance, Kraken, etc.).\n\nWe also have launched jXAF/jXOF, which are wrappers of jEUR (XAF and XOF are pegged to the Euro) to address the African market (+ we are building a fiat on and off-ramp in Africa). Any integration of jEUR is therefore accessible to jXAF/jXOF holders.\n\njEUR is a vital Euro stablecoin for the Polygon ecosystem since it can be converted for USDC at the oracle price; therefore, other euro stablecoins can be paired on Curve with jEUR in order to facilitate arbitrages to maintain their peg, or simply to access greater liquidity.\n\nWe debuted on Polygon around September. Currently, version 1 of the protocol is live and is limited (only 625k USDC of liquidity has been deposited for jEUR). A second version of the protocol, without those limitations, will be launched soon.\n\nThe protocol is very capital efficient and does not need a high TVL to works. 625k of USDC has enabled since October:\n\n- 3.5M jEUR in circulation ($4M).\n- $78M of volume on our primary market.\n- 33k swaps by 9k users.\n- $20M of transfers (wallet to wallet, excluding swaps).\n- $50M on secondary markets (Curve, Kyber).\n- $10M of fiat on and off-ramp.\n- 10k cumulative holders with 3k jEUR current holders.\n\n# Benefits for Aave V3\n### Fiat on and off-ramp\njEUR has the cheapest and most direct fiat on and off-ramp, which can create a direct bridge between banks and a “Euro savings account” on the Blockchain.\n\nWe have multiple non-individuals (companies) who are looking for a place to save Euro on the blockchain without taking the risks of yield farming programs (like on Curve).\n\nHaving jEUR on Aave, combined with our fiat on-ramp, would allow this use case to become a reality, and would allow users to borrow jEUR and off-ramp them for Euros.\n\n### Large addressable market\nA part from the Euro zone, jEUR is a vital part of our African strategy. jEUR can be wrapped into jXAF or jXOF, and we are working on abstracting jEUR for the end-users (people in Africa could deposit jXAF into Aave and earn interest on top of it; in reality, we would unwrap the jXAF for jEUR, but the end-user won’t see it).\n\n### jEUR is vital for other Euro stablecoins\njEUR being convertible for USDC at the Chainlink price feed, and being used by other euro stablecoins to maintain their peg and access liquidity (with a few more Euro stablecoins to join the party), it would be a perfect asset to borrow with leverage to perform arbitrages on Polygon.\n\n### DDM\njEUR also has a Direct Deposit Module allowing our DAO to mint uncollateralized jEUR and deposit them directly into money markets, to maintain a low-interest rate if needed.\n\n### Low risk collateral\nAs collateral, jEUR is also pretty safe since it always keep its peg and there is no slippage when buying/selling it on our primary market.\n\njEUR could be used in isolation mode to limit the risk for Aave.\n\njEUR has no Chainlink price feed but it uses the EURUSD price feed of Chainlink to settle its trades.\n\n\n# Risk Parameters\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameters. Obviously, this is the first proposition and the governance and risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters:\n\n1. V3 Efficiency mode EUR stablecoins (if it exists): 97% LTV, 98% liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n2. V3 Efficiency mode stablecoins: 90% LTV, 95% Liquidation threshold, 10% reserve factor\n3. V3 Isolation mode: 50% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 2M$ debt ceiling.\n\n# Security specification and risks\n\n### Risks inherent to jEUR\nBesides obvious smart contract risks, jEUR is over-collateralized with USDC, and therefore inherit from all the risk born by USDC.\n\njEUR liquidiations are secured by the UMA’s DVM oracle and jEUR trading happens at the Chainlink price feed, therefore jEUR inhereit from the risks of these two protocols.\n\n\n[More informations about the risks](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/risks)\n\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability.\njEUR can only be minted following the rules of the protocol on Polygon: users can send $X USDC to the liquidity pool to mint $X of jEUR, or the multi-sig can call the minting function from the DDM module.\n\nThere is currently no DAO, only a community-owned multisig (5/8) managing the treasury and two company-owned multisig (2/3), one admin and one maintainer (the admin can only add or revoke a maintainer). The maintainer can upgrade some parts of the protocols: minting and burning fees, address receiving the fees, adding/removing a new jFIAT, adding/removing supported collateral, calling the emergency shutdown function (settle all the jFIAT at the Chainlink price feed); changing the price feed.\n\nIt does not have any access/control over any funds. and we are transitioning to a ve-model together with a token rebranding in Q2, accompanying the launch our the protocol v2.\n\n### Audits\nWe have had two different audits by [Halborn](https://halborn.com/) and [Ubik](https://ubikgroup.co/): [Read the audits](https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/security)\n\n# Data\n\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n- Market Cap: €3.5M circulating ($4M)\n- 24h Volume: $2M on our primary market, $400k on secondary markets\n- Volatility: Low\n- Maturity: Early\n\n### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n- Discord: 3k members\n- Twitter: 16.1k followers\n\n### Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n- Date of Deployment: Sep 2021 (Polygon)\n- Number of Transactions: 116k transactions including 30k swaps on our primary market and 22k on secondary markets.\n- Number of holders for token: 3,242 (more holders possible due to farming programs)\n\n# Links\n- Website: [https://jarvis.network](https://jarvis.network)\n- Dune: [Jarvis Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/0xroll/JarvisNetwork)\n- Docs: [https://learn.jarvis.network](https://learn.jarvis.network)\n- Code: [https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network](https://gitlab.com/jarvis-network)\n\n# Voting options\n- YES, add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n- NO, do not add jEUR on Aave v3 on Polygon\n",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Correlated-asset price oracle (Aave CAPO)\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-02-05\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal for pre-approval on the activation of the Correlated-asset price oracle (Aave CAPO), introducing extra price protections for assets highly correlated with an underlying, like LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) or stablecoins.\nThis first iteration will be focused on upper price protection on Aave v3 assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn the Aave protocol, the pricing of assets is done in different ways: some feeds are coming directly from the Chainlink network and its algorithms, others combine multiple Chainlink feeds into one, and a last type combines some Chainlink and/or on-chain data to get a final price.\n\nThe most representative case of the last group of feeds using on-chain data is the price oracles for LSTs listed in Aave, like wstETH, stMATIC, or sAVAX. In these cases, the method of calculation is usually considering the price of the underlying, and multiplying by some type of exchange rate between the LST and the underlying. For example, for wstETH, the price is high-level calculated as the price of ETH in USD * exchange rate between stETH and ETH (assuming a 1:1 peg between ETH and stETH).\n\nThis approach for pricing is sound, as it reduces important price manipulation risks. However, there have been different discussions in the community surrounding the topic, and there is even the Killswitch project being developed in order to apply protective measures whenever the price of an LST based on the exchange rate deviates too much from a secondary market.\n\nHowever, there is another protection that could be applied based on a clear principle: for certain type of assets, the price should never be above a certain threshold that can be defined with pretty high certainty in advance.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal introduces adapters for different Aave v3 assets: LSTs and the majority of the stable-coins.\nThe codebase of the adapter can be found on https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-capo.\n\nEven if the initial configuration will be done at AIP stage following recommendations from the risk providers of the community (Gauntlet & Chaos Labs), the list of assets to apply the solution on is the following:\n\n**Aave v3 Ethereum**\n\n  `USDT, USDC, rETH, DAI, cbETH, sDAI, LUSD, FRAX, crvUSD, wstETH`\n\n  **Aave v3 Polygon**\n\n  `MATICx, USDC.e, USDC, stMATIC, USDT, DAI, wstETH, agEUR`\n\n  **Aave v3 Avalanche**\n\n  `sAVAX, USDC, USDt, DAI.e, FRAX`\n\n  **Aave v3 Optimism**\n\n  `wstETH, USDC.e, USDT, sUSD, USDC, DAI, rETH, LUSD`\n\n  **Aave v3 Arbitrum**\n\n  `wstETH, USDC, USDT, USDC.e, DAI, rETH, LUSD, FRAX, EURS`\n\n  **Aave v3 Metis**\n\n  `m.USDC, m.USDT, m.DAI`\n\n  **Aave v3 Base**\n\n  `cbETH, USDbC, USDC, wstETH`\n\n  **Aave v3 Gnosis**\n\n  `wstETH, sDAI, xDAI, USDC, EURe`\n\n  **Aave v3 BNB Chain**\n  `USDC, USDT`\n\nIf any further listing of applicable assets happen before AIP (new stablecoins and/or LSTs), the asset will be added to the list at that stage.\n\n## Voting options\n- **YES**. Proceed with the release of the Aave CAPO.\n- **NO**. Don't proceed with Aave CAPO.\n- **ABSTAIN**. No opinion",
