        "body": "title: Aave V3 Harmony - Freeze Reserves\nstatus: Proposal\nauthor: 3SE Holdings\n\nSimple Summary\nThis ARC presents the community with a first step towards addressing the current issues with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony in the aftermath of the exploit on Harmony’s Horizon Bridge.\n\nThis proposal calls for the Aave Guardian to freeze all reserves on the Aave V3 deployment on Harmony. This action would protect users by disabling the ability to deposit or borrow assets in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony, while still allowing repayment of debt, liquidations, withdrawals and changes to the interest rates. Freezing the reserves will not interfere with any direct transfers to any of the aToken contracts.\n\nMotivation\nThe Aave DAO Community, through the governance forum, has come to the rough consensus that actions should be taken to stabilize the Aave V3 Market on Harmony and limit the impact to the users, Protocol, and DAO. (Harmony Horizon bridge exploit. Consequences to Aave V3 Harmony 1\n\nThis proposed action is a first step that will protect users.It will give the Aave DAO full flexibility to further address the issue, by interest rate adjustments or other actions as the situation continues to develop.\n\nSpecification\nIf passed, this AIP will call upon the Aave Guardian to call the setReserveFreeze() function with the appropriate parameters on each asset in the Aave V3 Market on Harmony. In addition, passing this AIP will also authorize the necessary changes to the IPFS Aave UI to support this change (disabling supply and borrow) as well as implementing additional warnings and alerts to educate users attempting to interact with the Aave V3 Market on Harmony.",

        "body": "[Forum Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-11-04/6072)\n\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust seven (7) total risk parameters across five (5) Aave V2 assets including LTV, Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus. In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve. \n\nAs a side note, Gauntlet is also analyzing potential interest rate parameter updates for AMPL. \n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations, the latest being [AIP-43: Risk Parameter Updates 2021-10-21](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/43-QmZb3yBeYJv1ruGWfY1h7XNcya82Q6Jqs4Q7b5dDMwuN3U).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. For more detail on Gauntlet's first two months of recommendations and their impact, please see [Q2 Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-q2-dynamic-risk-parameters/5955) and the [Monthly Risk Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review-october-2021/5887).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis past week had significant updates in market conditions as well as drastic changes within the Aave protocol. Volatility drops and increases in trading volume and liquidity for most assets were observed. At the same time, there were significant withdrawals from stablecoins reserves. These transactions should not lead to less protocol safety, but these transient changes are important to consider within the context of ecosystem structure.\n\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |\n| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |\n| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |\n| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n\n\n\nSee below volatility and exchange volume data from 10/21 to 11/04 that were important drivers for the updated parameter recommendations.\n\n|Symbol| 11-04 Volatility| 10-21 Volatility| Volatility Change| Weekly Average Daily Volume Change (%) |\n|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|\n|ENJ   |1.13420106     |1.099162375    |0.035038685      |4.707755052|\n|REN   |1.101234165    |1.530519396    |-0.429285231     |0.073368269|\n|SNX   |0.77106532     |1.070499773    |-0.299434453     |1.189819991|\n|SUSHI |0.973681039    |1.284012632    |-0.310331593     |0.641782118|\n|ZRX   |0.8480448      |1.067526026    |-0.219481226     |6.053287908|\n\n\n\n\n\n**Freezing KNCL**\nThe KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/KIPs/blob/master/KIPs/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https://www.notion.so/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https://www.notion.so/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.\n\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ga0jHyO.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c2GahMu.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n* Targeting an AIP on 2021-11-08\n\n\n",
