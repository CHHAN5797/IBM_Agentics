        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - GHO Funding\nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2023-09-17\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication seeks to acquire GHO from secondary markets to support the Aave DAO's short-term funding needs.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe objective of this publication is to further transition Aave DAO's expenses towards being nominated in GHO. The below highlights some potential use cases for GHO:\n\n* 870,000 over 6 months [Aave Grants Continuation Proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14831)\n    * Another 300,000 GHO if AAVE is replaced with GHO\n* 75,000 GHO over 3 months [Expansion of “Orbit”](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-expansion-of-orbit-a-dao-funded-delegate-platform-initiative/14785)\n* 406,000 GHO over 3 months [GHO Liquidity Committee](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-create-and-fund-gho-liquidity-committee/14800)\n* TBA Future ACI Funding Request (Renewal mid-October)\n\nAlthough the GHO Liquidity Committee is funded via its own AIP, its inclusion here indicates the magnitude of the potential ongoing spend. The current ACI funding proposal is 250,000 aUSDT, which serves only as a budgetary estimate. Similarly, the 406,000 over the back 3 months of a 6-month lookahead is used as a budgetary estimate.\n\nThe spend identified above over the next 6 months is 1.676M GHO, or 1.976M GHO if AAVE is replaced with GHO within AGD proposal.\n\nThere is also the potential [420,000 GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-swap-b-80bal-20weth-to-gho/14684) being acquired by swapping B-80BAL-20wETH to GHO via the Aave Swap Contract.\n\nThere is also the potential for additional expenses to emerge, such as a renewal proposal from Gauntlet during late Q4 2023. An additional proposal will be presented closer to the time to accommodate any new GHO nominated expenses.\n\nThis publication proposes converting 1.6M of stable coins held in the Ethereum Treasury to GHO. This will complement the existing realized GHO revenue. The GHO is to be held in the Treasury where existing service providers receive payment from.\n\nAt the time of writing, swapping to acquire GHO will generate positive slippage, and the entire swap can be performed without causing GHO to trade above the $1 peg. The Aave DAO can then distribute GHO amongst the community using a price of $1.\n\n# Specification\n\nUsing the Aave Swap Contract, convert the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* 49,900 aDAI v2\n* 69,800 aBUSD v2\n* 75,800 aTUSD v2\n* 381,700 aBUSD v1\n* 400,000 aEthDAI v3\n* 622,800 aUSDT v2\n\nThe GHO will be transferred to the [Aave Ethereum Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c).\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Create and Fund GHO Liquidity Committee\nAuthor: @TokenLogic\nDated: 2023-09-08\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents Aave DAO the opportunity to create and fund the GHO Liquidity Committee for an initial 3 month duration.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the coming weeks, we expect the voting base to reallocate gauge votes away from GHO liquidity pools. This is largely due to those voting for GHO pools incurring an opportunity cost by not participating in the bribe market.\n\nIf the Aave DAO was to lock all of its BPT for veBAL, the gauge vote is equivalent to 1.8% of veBAL. Even with some voters continuing to support GHO, a good portion of the 7.7% will move to other pools. There is also the impact of [AIP-42](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682) for the DAO to consider. Voting support from external teams is expected to taper beyond what Aave DAO can replace with its own strategic assets. Furthermore, as the liquidity pools continue to grow additional gauge voting support is required to maintain the APR over time. Whilst the Aave Safety Module (SM) has the potential to be a more long term sustained solution, integrating BPTs that contain GHO, this requires time to develop and should not be rushed.\n\nMeanwhile, the [GHO price](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/) is consistently trading between 96 cents and 99 cents. When the liquidity in the GHO/Aave Boosted Pool was withdrawn, the GHO peg improved. This is because the pool was >85% GHO and had minimal USDC, USDT and DAI deposits. Increasing the GHO borrow rate is also expected to support the GHO peg as minting GHO to farm rewards in liquidity pools is less profitable.\n\n![|602x231](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7_4E7_tF8xRZe5tUFyoeXnJB3UbWDs7C7aGaohFzMjxM_aBGLmMvAREOjrtIS5yppMcrUaov3Q18-jIGcnjJk4x17wy91VheIUZSkIa0Y2a9Ay_kLTLRZ0w6zKR8PEpjE3jqJIBPzfF)\n\nThe LUSD/GHO pool on Maverick, is also heavily concentrated in GHO and migrating this liquidity to a wider liquidity band pool is expected to also help support the peg.\n\nCreating several concentrated liquidity pools is expected to help improve the GHO peg. These pools will have wide and narrow ranges. Liquidity will need to be migrated from the wide range to the narrow range pool over time. This will require more active management than what on-chain governance allows.\n\nThe recent CRV acquisition indicates the DAO will likely be supporting a GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve Finance. The current CRV holding can be used to kick start a pool, however additional support is likely to be needed to continue growing the pool. There is also a GHOFRAXBP pool being setup by the Frax team which can be co-incentivised. Pending how these pools progress, additional scope/budget may be added at a later stage.\n\nGiven the time sensitive nature of needing to support GHO liquidity, this publication proposes creating a Liquidity Committee with an initial budget. The committee shall focus solely on GHO liquidity and shall consist of a relatively small highly skilled team.\n\nThe Liquidity Committee can support GHO whilst other initiatives are being considered. Even after GHO liquidity pool receipt tokens are integrated into the SM, the Liquidity Committee can participate in bribe markets to boost the yield on the SM integrations.\n\nLonger term the DAO should revisit the impact of the committee and determine if it is still required. Furthermore, the composition of the committee should be revisited at a late date. With this in mind, this proposal suggests the Liquidity Committee’s initial mandate shall last for a 3 month duration.\n\n# Liquidity Strategy\n\nDetails on the liquidity strategy are to be detailed in a separate forum post. The liquidity strategy is to be implemented on the following Decentralise Exchanges:\n\n* Balancer\n* Maverick\n* Uniswap via Bunni\n\nThis forum post is to focus on the creation of the Liquidity Committee and associated fundings.\n\n# Performance Measures\n\nThe following performance measures are proposed:\n\n* Time GHO peg is above 98.5 cents and 99.0 cents\n  * % above/below 98.5 cents over trailing 7 days\n  * % above/below 99.0 cents over trailing 7 days\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Maverick\n  * Target $5M\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Uniswap\n  * Target $5M\n* Improvement in swap size for defined price impact via Cowswap or Paraswap\n  * 0.25% and 0.5% price impact to USDC\n* TVL in Balancer Liquidity Pools\n\nTarget $10M ($5M per pool)\n\nThese measures will be shown on the GHO Analytics platform provided by TokenLogic.\n\n# Committee Structure\n\nThe Liquidity Committee is to consist of 7 signers and will utilise a 4 of 7 SAFE to implement transactions. To ensure there is smooth operational consistency, there are distinct roles within the committee.\n\nTokenLogic will perform the following function:\n\n* Provide analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy\n* Liaise with teams that support the protocols hosting the GHO liquidity\n* Lead & Coordinate the committees weekly activities\n\nAll signers are to provide the following support:\n\n* Provide critical feedback / help refine the strategy\n* Verify and sign transactions\n\nIt should be noted, that actively managing liquidity takes time and effort to stay up to date with the attest events happening across all the protocols supporting GHO liquidity. Verifying transactions as a signer is also a notable time commitment.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe initial 3 months funding for the Liquidity Committee is as shown below:\n\n* 406,000 GHO - Liquidity Incentives\n* 5 ETH - Gas\n\nA breakdown of the Liquidity Incentive budget is shown below:\n![|602x224](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_P69n971i9uu38kLAiBQKpiESXHTZJc__Q6PKuvWCxxp7ZaHn7zU-eEVpFSHFcD1W2ZurPx49T-W4Dg0fY25krVHC07nZ0_XCQtyylq9LPafWuxv-G4Ca-19mWfE2-URZ-6BL94nIhH)\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the incentive budget and strategy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801).\n\nThere is a nominal 5 ETH allowance included in the budget. This amount was arbitrarily selected and ensures the SAFE & signing wallets are well funded.Some transactions can be executed directly from the SAFE.\n\nAny funds not used shall be returned to the Treasury or rolled over into supporting the next iteration of the Liquidity Committee.\n\n# Specification\n\nA Gnosis Safe will be created, this SAFE will hold funds and implement the quests. A small, high context team is proposed to implement the strategies modelled by the TokenLogic team.\n\n|Signer|Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Matthew Graham (TokenLogic)|0xb647055A9915bF9c8021a684E175A353525b9890|\n|Dydymoon (TokenLogic)|0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f|\n|Emilio|0x9C3E82658d10064121048A21c69978D3400abb25|\n|Marc (ACI)|0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4|\n|Figue (Paladin)|0x009d13E9bEC94Bf16791098CE4E5C168D27A9f07|\n|Solarcurve (Balancer)|0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3|\n|TokenBrice (DeFi Collective)|0xAA7A9d80971E58641442774C373C94AaFee87d66|\n\nTo fund the multisig, the following assets within the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO:\n\n* 406,000 [aEthDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n5 ETH and 406,000 units GHO are to be transferred from the Treasury to the Liquidity Committee multisig.\n\nAddress: `here`\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

The prospect of becoming a paid delegate has emerged and this publication seeks to define the relationship between delegate and service provider in the context of receiving payment from Aave.\n\nAt the core of the topic, should a Service Provider that offers a Delegation Platform receive additional payment for providing the Delegation Platform service. Similarly, should Delegation Platforms who progress to becoming a service provider continue to receive delegation platform payments. How could Aave remunerate delegates who offer more than governance participation. Are these mutually exclusive payments or is the same entity able to receive payment for being both a delegate and Service Provider.\n\nAs Aave does not offer payment for providing a Delegation Platform, this conversation is pre-empting a future state within the community. By having this conversation now, it will provide clear indication of the communities sentiment to be factored into various contributors future plans whilst not adversley affecting any current contributor. \n\n# Motivation\n\nA quick summary of Delegation Platforms which are either current or proposing to become a Service Provider:\n\n* [ACI Delegation Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-chan-initiative-delegate-platform/10877)\n* [ACI 6 Month Budget](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344/12)\n* [Llama Delegation Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/delegate-to-llama/9043)\n* [Llama <> Aave](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/104/)\n\nAt the time of writing neither of the teams mentioned above are seeking payment for being a delegate.\n\nThere are numerous delegates within the Aave ecosystem which are supportive of delegates receiving payment for the service they are offering Aave. This has been mentioned in the comments on this [thread](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344/6). Through passing conversations and reading over other governance threads, several current delegates are intending or considering contributing to Aave beyond participating in governance decisions. \n\nWith the emergence of the prospect for paid delegation and there already being service proviers with delegations platforms, there is the potential for Aave to provide payment to the same entity for being both Service Provider and Delegate. This publication does not present an opinion, as it affects the author, but seeks to kick start the conversation and will continue to update the post based upon community feedback.\n\nFrom a budget perspective, Aave needs to consider the prospect of remunerating delegates and how this affects service providers with delegation platforms. Similarly, how would Aave reward delegates who provide a service beyond participating in governance. \n\nTo help kick start conversation, a few considerations are shared below:\n\n* Delegation Platforms are providing a service to Aave and therefore should be considered service providers and thus rewarded for there efforts.\n* Service Providers are sufficiently paid and any delegation platform should not receive additional payment.\n* Delegation platforms represent an additional time commitment for Service Providers and should be consider worthy of a separate payment.\n* Delegation Platforms may seek to submit AIPs and spearhead initiatives adding value beyond a voting service. Examples include supporting adoption of GHO and market marking services etc...\n* AGD can be used to provide incremental payments to delegates who perform a service beyond voting participation\n* Should Aave consider a potential voting delegation renumeration construct which recognises registered addresses with voting influence and how active they are within Aave governance. There are several iterations of this across the industry which can researched and tailored to suit Aave. Would this approach include or exclude Service Providers.\n* Delegation Platform may build a material voting base which then enables easier transition to becoming a Service Provider.\n* Service Providers require proposal power to submit AIP and the emergence of delegation platforms may lead to teams loosing proposal power preventing AIPs from being submitted. This may suggest a preference for Aave or stkAAVE holders to separate voting and proposal power delegation.\n\nThe above outlines some considerations for discussion in the comments.\n\n# Voting Options\n\n---\n\n**Option 1 - Delegate Gas Rebate Program**\n\nThis option reflects the proposal outline [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gas-fee-rebate-for-on-chain-votes/12559) and no additional funding outside of this proposal is to be allocated to delegates for governance participating during the next 6 months. After the 6 month window has passed Aave DAO is then able to review this decision. \n\n---\n\n**Option 2 - Incentivised Delegates Program excluding Service Providers**\n\n@Llama shall design an Incentivised Delegate Program, which only recognised delegates are eligible for inclusion within, for the community to review and comment on. This will include a review of existing programs already implemented in the industry, with the a recommended program being published as a TEMP CHECK for the Aave DAO to review and iterate on.\n\nDo note, Service Providers are excluded from receiving economic reward for being a recognised delegate platform.\n\n---\n\n**Option 3 - Incentivised Delegate & Service Providers including Service Providers**\n\nSimilar to Option 2, with the only difference being Service Provider are to receive payment as a Recognised Delegates.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

TokenLogic shall focus on Aave DAO finances and support GHO adoption.\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nMembers of the TokenLogic team have been contributing to Aave Protocol since mid 2020. More recently, the team has been expanding in preparation to better support our three focus areas:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* Safety Module modelling\n* GHO Adoption\n\nTokenLogic is a developer focused team with a proven track recorded dating back to March 2023 when the delegation platform was annouced. During this time we have delivered the following:\n\n* 5 AIPs, 6 payloads, several GHO related BIPs\n* [GHO liquidity pools analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n* Coordinated [7.7%](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071) veBAL support for GHO's launch\n* Stoodup an analytics platform \n* Launch of [GHO Analytics frontend](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n\nThe team is growing and we onboarded an accounting team to start developing a Aave Financial Reporting (genesis to date) frontend, launch date mid/late Q4 2023.\n\n# Current & Future Areas of Focus\n\n The below provides a high level overview of our **key focus** areas:\n\n* **Treasury Management**\n    * Improving the risk adjusted return of DAO's assets\n        * Aave v2 to v3 migrations\n        * Swap long tail assets to ETH / stable coins\n    * Improving capital efficiency\n        * Convert wMATIC to MaticX & stMATIC\n    * Managing strategic assets\n        * Upgrades to Strategic Asset Manager v1 functionality as required\n    * Modelling asset purchase / bribe\n        * Participate in Quest/Bribe v acquiring asset\n    * Engage, collaborate and support community lead initiatives\n        * Example: How best to optimise CRV holding\n    * Oversee Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) deployment\n        * If DAO elects to provide POL, ensure Boost is directed to holding to optimise returns and maintain the strategy through claiming and swapping/locking rewards.\n    * Design and create a contract for managing DAO's POL\n        * Perform swaps, claim incentives, transfer assets etc...\n    * Claim Aave Protocol revenue fees at the end of each month\n        * This bot is currently operated by Llama\n\n* **GHO Liquidity / Incentives Management**\n    * Create Liquidity Management Committee / Budget\n        * Provide modelling to support Committee decision making\n    * Liquidity Incentive Optimisation Analysis (Strategic Assets)\n        * Target pool sizes & APRs \n    * Explore synergies with Safety Module diversification\n        * Potential to include GHO liquidity pools\n        * We will lead this effort after Llama's contract finishes\n* **Financial Reporting**\n    * Runway forecast\n        * Specifically tracking asset balance and drawdown rates to show when other assets require being swapped to fund the DAO\n    * Budget and resource allocation\n        * Work with ACI and others to develop a DAO budget\n    * Transparent accurate, third party reviewed, accessible financial statments\n        * Launch a financial statment frontend mid/late Q4 2023\n        * Cover Ethereum, Polygon (PoS), Arbitrum, Optimism and Avalanche initially and expand over time.\n        * Quarterly financial publications \n    * Revenue per Reserve v time charts\n        * Daily or Hourly data showing revenue being generated per Reserve on each Aave v2 and v3 iteration\n        * Users will be able to select an asset and see total revenue noiminated in the underlying or select an instance of Aave and a specific asset.\n        * Data will be displayed graphically with some ability to interact with the charts\n* **Supporting GHO Adoption**\n    * Collaborate with other teams to support GHO adoption\n        * Promote utility and velocity\n    * Continual development of GHO Analytics frontend\n    * Promote adoption through DeFi integrations\n        * Examples include working with teams to build real yield strategies, structured products and list GHO as collateral\n* **Safety Module Improvements**\n    * Model the SM performance during shortfall events\n        * Create a frontend that show historical performance for swapping certain amounts of each asset instantly (not dutch auction) via an aggregator\n    * Model / forecast emission budget\n        * AAVE emissions are finite, GHO is better\n        * Capital efficiency could be improved through adoption of quests and/or acquiring assets that control the emission schedule of another protocol\n    * Advocate for diversification and reducing the reward budget\n        * Introduction of stable coins, ETH and other assets to reduce reliance on AAVE during shortfall events\n    * Collaborate with others to refine to enhance the SM's effectiveness at providing a backstop for Aave Protocol\n        * BGD to implement on-chain upgrades\n        * Model liquidity pool assets to be added to SM\n        * Work with ACI, BGD, Llama and others to determine a target coverage, implementation of proposals and refine the asset blend\n\nEach of the areas detailed above is interwoven and has a material affect on the DAO's financial status. TokenLogic is committed to working with other DAO contributors collaboratively and constructively to better the Aave Protocol. \n\nTo support the initiatives aboves, we have created an analytics platform. The GHO dashboard is our first analytics initiative. Beyond GHO, we plan on using the analytics platform to provide the DAO with near live revenue data stream for each asset reserve on supported networks. We seek to always incorporate community feedback and build out any requests from the community.\n\nOur team is very well connected across defi and we intend to support Aave and GHO where ever we can. To this end, we are already working with several teams looking to integrate GHO and have been working with @0xbilll at AGD with targeted spending initiatives.\n\nTo ensure continuation of active work scopes, TokenLogic will continue to manage the migration of users on Polygon v2 to v3. This includes either fortnightly or monthly parameter adjustments. We encourage another service provider to pick up the Avalanche v2 migration. However, if required, we are happy to support provided it doesn't impact our key focus ares which we will be measure against.\n\n# Prior Work\n\nThis section, we will focus on what TokenLogic has delivered to Aave DAO:\n\n* [TokenLogic Delegate Platform](https://governance.aave.com/t/tokenlogic-delegate-platform/12516)\n* Asset Listings\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX to Aave V3 Ethereum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-to-aave-v3-ethereum/13051)\n    * [[AIP] Add FRAX Ethereum Aave v3](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/260/)\n    * [[ARFC] Add FRAX Arbitrum Aave v3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-frax-arbitrum-aave-v3/13222)\n    * [[AIP] Add ARB to Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/273/)\n* GHO Liquidity\n    * [[TEMP CHECK] GHO Liquidity Pools](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655)\n    * [[ARFC] GHO Liquidity Pools: Primary Pools Initial Strategy](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gho-liquidity-pools-primary-pools-initial-strategy/14071)\n    * Coordinated veBAL and vlAURA support for the launch of GHO\n* GHO Analytics Dashboard\n    * https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/\n* GHO Yield Strategy\n    * Supported **Sommelier** with development of real yield strategies that manage GHO liquidity across several DEXs.

With several developers, strategists and accountants apart the team, we are mostly manned up and ready to take on a more involved service provider scope. \n\n# Budget\n\nWe are requesting a total budget of 350,000 USD for an initial 6 month period to support our initiatives.\n\nThis budget will contribute to covering operational expenses, including tools, subscriptions, and infrastructure plus the resources required to deliver our work.\n\nThe payment terms are as shown below:\n\nUpfront Transfer: ~~210,000~~ 0 GHO\nStream: ~~140,000~~ 350,000 GHO\n\nThis is a ~~60/40~~ 0/100 split of upfront/streamed.\n\nAddress: `eth:0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nSimilar to ACI, TokenLogic is to be included in the [Gas Rebate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-gas-rebate-for-recognized-delegates/13290) program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts and deployment costs.\n\nTokenLogic commits to not receiving any funds from other entities for creating proposals and publishing AIPs on Aave Protocol.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nThe below provides an overview of how the DAO can assess TokenLogic's performance:\n\n* Migrate Aave DAO funds from v2 to v3\n* Create Liquidity Committee with funding\n* Optimise GHO liquidity incentives \n* Strategic Assets are being actively used\n* Runway funding sustained (>6 months of the correct assets)\n* Convert Treasury assets to LSTs\n* Launch financial statement frontend\n* Continual flow of new GHO Dashboard features\n\nAs DAOs are dynamic, when more urgent priorities emerge TokenLogic will support and proactively work with other service providers to act in Aave's best interest. \n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf the [TEMP CHECK] is successful and the community supports our proposal, we will move forward with a formal [ARFC] submission to governance.\n\nWe are committed to maintaining transparency throughout the process and providing regular updates the community on our progress.\n\nWe thank everyone for considering our proposal and appreciate your support. We look forward to working together and driving success to the Aave Protocol.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\n[ARFC] Deploy BAL & aBAL from the Collector Contract\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@MatthewGraham) and @dydymoon\nCreated: 2023-02-05 (updated)\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal presents two options for deploying the approximately 100k BAL tokens being acquired by AIP 115 and the aBAL holding in the Ethereum Collector Contract, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nAIP 115 has been successfully implemented and Aave has acquired an additional 100k BAL on market. The total BAL and aBAL holding is now 308,978.30. With 200k BAL already committed to veBAL, this proposal will determine how to deploy the remaining 108,978.30 BAL with the overall objective of maximizing the growth potential of Aave, [4,16].\n\nAave Snapshot voters can choose between two options, each of which has varying degrees of complexity and represents different means of achieving similar goals over different time horizons.\n\nOption 1) Locking veBAL.\nOption 2) Staking auraBAL.\n\nOption 1) is about locking B-80BAL-20WETH enabling Aave to participate in Balancer gauge and governance votes, and benefit from the Liquidity Provider (LP) boosting and protocol fees earnings.\n\nOption 2) focuses on yield, forgoes governance influence (participating in votes) and presents a higher yield investment strategy that over time, will lead to more governance influence relative to Option 1).\n\nA Snapshot will be posted enabling the community to choose between both options. Llama recommends voting for Option 1).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis BAL holding has been acquired by the Aave with the goal of supporting Aave lending market adoption. In pursuit of driving growth to the Aave markets, the BAL holding needs to be deployed and utilised.\n\nAave has the following BAL and aBAL holdings on Ethereum:\n\n* 200k BAL acquired via a token swap with Balancer DAO, [1].\n* 100k BAL acquired via an on market acquisition swap contract, [4].\n* 8,978.30 aBAL acquired through user borrowing BAL on Aave, [10].\n\nThis proposal will focus on how best to deploy the 100k BAL and 8,978.30 aBAL.\n\n## Option 1) Locking veBAL\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for 'Balancer Pool Token') for a time duration. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nIn Option 1), Aave DAO converts all BAL (incl. Redeem aBAL for BAL) with sufficient WETH to B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH token is then deposited into the VotingEscrow veBAL contract and locked for the maximum duration, 1 year. This proposal will acquire the B-80BAL-20WETH and explain the goals of utilising the veBAL holdings while a separate proposal will detail how the veBAL is to be managed before being deployed to veBAL.\n\n### What’s veBAL ?\n\nveBAL are not transferable and the voting influence decays on the veTokens balance over time requiring the veBAL to be relocked periodically to maintain maximum voting influence. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be locked from 1 week to 1 year. Ie: 1 B-80BAL-20WETH locked 1 year = 1 veBAL, locked 6 months = 0,5 veBAL etc\n\n* **Gauge-weight Power**\nVoting power which influences the BAL emissions on the different gauges. The votes happen every week on Balancer governance. It can be used for several goals which will be described later on this post.\n\n* **Governance Power**\nVoting influence in Balancer DAO proposals. Since Balancer DAO utilities off-chain governance, the voting power can be delegated via Snapshot. Note: Llama is currently a Balancer DAO delegate.\n\n* **veBoost**\nLocking B-80BAL-20WETH earns a boost of up to 2.5x on the liquidity provided on Balancer.\n\n* **Protocol Fees**\n75% of all trading fees consolidated for bb-a-USD (stable) + BAL coming from the veBAL gauge are distributed to lockers, [9].\n\n### veBAL Position Overview\n\nBy maximising the veBAL holding and using over 308.9K BAL with the proportional amount of WETH (326.88) for a combined worth of $2,719,000 at the time of writing, Aave would receive an estimated ~153,520.38 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. Converted to veBAL, the ~153,520.38 units would represent approximately 1.10% of the BPT liquidity and 1.40% of the veBAL supply. Aave would be one of the largest veBAL holders along with Aave Companies, [5].\n\nWith 145,000 BAL tokens currently being minted and distributed each week across four networks and Aave holding 1.40% of veBAL supply, this is equivalent to controlling the distribution of 2036 BAL per week, or $14,496 per week ($753,8080 per year, assuming a BAL price $7.12).\n\nBAL emissions reduce yearly as per the inflation schedule and the next reduction will occur at the end of March 2023, pivoting from 145,000 to 121,930 BAL/week. With 2023 emission and the same veBAL share, Aave would be able to redirect 1,712 BAL/week, or $12,189 per week or $633,850 per year, assuming a BAL price at $7.12.\n\nAave can utilise its veBAL holdings to support, not limited to, the below strategies:\n\n* Redirect incentives on existing Balancer pools\n* Optimise the yield on treasury strategies\n* Bootstrap the Staked aToken Reserves\n* Grow and sustain the GHO liquidity\n* Help sustain the Safety Module yield\n\nThe boost amount received depends on the value of the funds deposited and the relative sizing of the veBAL holding. The boost can be used directly on the Collector Contract but considering the amounts of available funds, the boost is unlikely to be sufficient to boost all of Aave’s positions in Balancer Liquidity Pools. Therefore, it is likely any treasury strategies will be a mix of both depositing into Balancer gauges directly or via Aura Finance.\n\nThere remains the possibility to sell the veBoost on secondary markets like Warden, [6].\n\n### veBAL yield overview\n\nThe veTokens yield can vary a lot depending on several parameters:\n\n* bb-a-USD fees depends on the trading volume (Swap fee: 0.67% APR)\n* BAL rewards are coming from the veBAL gauge (BAL rewards: up to 0.91% APR)\n* The veBoost yield is hard to estimate as it won’t be the same if used on POL (up to 2.5x the yield), or sold\n\nIn the second case, the current minimum price listed on Warden is 0.00014 BAL/veBAL/week\n\nveBoost if sold: from 0.27% APR with a BAL price of 7.14$ and a veBAL price of $18.92\n\n* Bribes: The biggest variation on the veBAL yield comes from the bribes received for the gauge weight power. Last week, the average cost was ~$0.085/veBAL vote/week. Gauges weight APR: 23.3%.\n\nIt’s important to note that the yield impact is better when some funds are deployed in strategies, farming boosted rewards on the pools voted.\n\n## Option 2) Staking auraBAL\n\nOption 2) maximises earning whilst forgoing Aave’s ability to participate in BAL emission distribution votes. Both Option 1) and 2) involve obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH position.\n\nAfter the B-80BAL-20WETH position is obtained, Aave could deposit it into Aura Finance’s auraBAL wrapper contract to earn staking yield in the several forms (1.87% stables (bb-a-USD), 24.09% in BAL and 34.59% in AURA for a total of 60.56% APR), [8].\n\nDepositing into the B-80BAL-20WETH/Aura pool and staking the BPT was considered, however this is more complex to execute and maintain for margin additional yield.\n\nThe yield received from the auraBAL holding can be compounded to earn additional yield.\n\n* BAL (24.09% of 60.56%): BAL, aBAL and WETH from the Collector Contract can be swapped for B-80BAL-20WETH and staked on Aura Finance.\n* bb-a-USD (1.87% of 60.56%): bb-a-USD can be deposited on Aura to earn 6.53% in (0.06% swap fees, 0.83% bb-a-USD, 2.30% BAL, 3.35% AURA).\n* AURA (34.67% of 60.32%): AURA can be locked for vlAURA and used to vote where BAL and AURA incentives will be directed. The vlAURA position generates around 3.34% in auraBAL as well as gives vote weight for proposal and gauge weight voting, [11]. The vlAURA lock period is 16 weeks and 4 days, depending on locking date and after this time, the AURA can be redeemed and swapped.\n\nGrowing a vlAURA position over time in addition to the veBAL one will increase the total voting power controlled over time, which will help to drive TVL to Aave markets and generate more earnings.\n\nWith 200K BAL from the token swap + WETH to be deposited in veBAL and 108,978.30 BAL + WETH into the auraBAL staking contract, Aave will own ~54,220 auraBAL and ~99,600 veBAL.\n\nBy staking 54,220 auraBAL, Aave DAO will hold approximately 1,99% of the auraBAL supply, [7].\n\nOption 2) is focused on depositing B-80BAL-20WETH on Aura to earn more BAL & AURA rewards.\n\n## Comments\n\nTo help with the decision making, the table below presents some pros and cons of each approach. The TL;DR: veBAL has an immediate impact whilst auraBAL is a longer term, higher return strategy that compounds over time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JasIpLf.png)\n\nLlama suggests Option 1) to focus on accumulating voting power as soon as possible, to support all possibilities mentioned above.\n\nThere are several more advanced strategies to which Aave could deploy assets to grow its strategic voting power over time which will be detailed in the RF strategies deployment proposal.\n\nIt is reasonable to think that, in time, AURA could be listed as collateral on Aave, generating aAURA revenue which could also be used to bolster this strategy. The compounding effects of using Aave’s revenue stream presents a unique opportunity to gain influence in how BAL and AURA incentives are distributed.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis section has been up dated and uses data from early March 2023 which differs from older data mentioned earlier in this post.\n\nTo summarise, the below shows the current BAL and wETH to be swapped to B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n|Asset|Amount|Price|Value|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BAL|309,102.07|$6.61|$2,043,756.21|\n|wETH|326.31|$1,565.79|$510,939.05|\n|B-80BAL-20wETH|||$2,554,695.26|\n\nThe amount of B-80BAL-20WETH received is estimated to be 152,617.94 units valued at\n\nLlama proposes the following methodology for obtaining the B-80BAL-20WETH holding:\n\n1. Redeem 326.31 awETH for wETH\n2. Approve 326.31 wETH on Cowswap\n3. Swap all 326.31 WETH to BAL. This routing minimises slippage.\n![|307x257](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/91M03SGqVM-CY3EA640gypvHrKToAMDGkze_9_55Ac9ZuOH3fB16bQXc50YjlxsgHbp0auh2pd7aLjNmdjzWevNnyB1zOurqwNRuO88x1VtW4MvifbzV8tVuIo3Ec8icnAPyZ4qj5rtrNUYsMiIfR_Q)\nThe BAL holdings are now 78,011.66 + 309,102.07 = 387,113.73 BAL\n4. Approve BAL on Cowswap\n5. Swap all BAL for B-80BAL-20WETH\n\n![|312x312](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NyamWu2oOW0-UTQrXfcgD2kR4Z6J64pqWmD2kFrcZd_8Ay-MrXsGlGtIXnKSbhcHjzvfFFMtGTc_Hlpuel5Qp0j8GevSPNkqB9AkPN5LZhQLmAW-c8jYmESZPCkEI4QkSc8QaOhdFarIytRV6uq2QNA)\n\nAave is expected to receive 152,617.94 units of B-80BAL-20WETH. The B-80BAL-20WETH can be deposited into the voter escrow contract and locked to create a veBAL holding for Aave.\n\nAt the time of writing there are [14,133,907](https://dune.com/balancerlabs/veBAL) units of B-80BAL-20WETH in circulating supply backed by 28,685,996 BAL and 29,196 wETH valued at $235,329,238.4 or $16.65/unit of B-80BAL-20WETH.\n\n152,617.94*16.65 = $2,541,088.70\n$2,541,088.70 - $2,554,695.26 = -$13,606.56\n\nIn performing the above transactions, Aave incurs $13,606.56 (0.53%) of price impact (slippage) in converting 309,102.07 units of BAL and 326.31 units of wETH.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the Balancer veBAL tool generates 153,121.46 units of B-80BAL-20WETH for depositing 309,102 units of BAL and 323 units of wETH. Using this reference data, Aave would incur 0.33% of price impact. This is reflective of the estimated difference in B-80BAL-20WETH received between Cowswap and [Balancer’s veBAL Tool](https://balancer.tools/veBAL).\n\nThe number above are accurate at the time the post was drafted and shared for review. The final numbers to be used will be based upon the actual BAL and aBAL holding at the time.\n\n\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nThe above proposal focuses on whether Aave’s preference is for maximum governance influence or yield. Depending upon which direction Aave elects to proceed, there will be various other considerations and discussions that emerge.\n\nThose considerations are:\n\n* Determine how to use the veBAL and/or vlAURA holdings, GHO, staked aToken pools, pools include in the Safety Module upgrade\n* Implementation of meta-governance, via Snapshot, AIP, multi-sig etc…, [3,4]\n* Continual conversion of aBAL and awETH to veBAL, if Option 1) is voted\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115\n[2] https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmVqWgpRmoEvvhvXZFepmAgYU5ZK9XpSs39MExEUpiJZw3\n[3] https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/\n[4] https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484/19\n[5] https://dune.com/queries/782195/1395498\n[6] https://app.warden.vote/dashboard/\n[7] https://etherscan.io/tx/0x94ac1109d58b02b5b74f10d92fb816a9cdc4b198fd455cc2bb2fdbb52ae84f9e\n[8] https://etherscan.io/token/0x616e8BfA43F920657B3497DBf40D6b1A02D4608d?a=0x5e5ea2048475854a5702f5b8468a51ba1296efcc\n[9] https://dev.balancer.fi/resources/deploy-pools-from-factory/creation/aavelinearpool\n[10] https://etherscan.io/token/0x272f97b7a56a387ae942350bbc7df5700f8a4576?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n[11] https://app.aura.finance/#/lock\n[12] https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249\n[13] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [13].",
