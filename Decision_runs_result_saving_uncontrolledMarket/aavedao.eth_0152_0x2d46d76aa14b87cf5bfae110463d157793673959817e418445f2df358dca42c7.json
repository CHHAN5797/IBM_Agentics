However, it also brings limitations, especially considering the existence of many non-EVM blockchains that offer different advantages such as lower transaction fees, higher throughput, and more advanced consensus mechanisms. In addition to purely technical advantages, many non-EVM blockchains can allow the Aave community to expand to an entirely new ecosystem, previously inaccessible user groups, and introduce new product possibilities.\n\nAptos is a blockchain designed for building scalable and secure dApps. Developed by former leaders of Meta's Diem blockchain project, it aims to address some of the limitations in existing blockchain systems such as throughput, scalability, and security. With a TVL of approximately $350m and growing rapidly, Aptos is the 17th largest chain by TVL (source: [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Aptos)). Its robust infrastructure offers high transaction throughput, low, predictable fees, and advanced security through the [Move programming language](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/why-move), that make Aptos an ideal platform for DeFi applications. The chain has a diverse array of [DeFi](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/defi) offerings, including prominent projects like Thala, Aries Markets, Amnis Finance, Econia, alongside primarily EVM-native projects such as Sushiswap and Pancake Swap. Aptos Labs Founders Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching have leveraged their extensive experience at Meta to propel Aptos towards becoming a leader in scalable and secure blockchain solutions. Moreover, Aptos has established high-profile partnerships with industry giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft, SK Telecom and many more others, further enhancing its technological capabilities and broadening its influence.\n\n*Advantages of Aptos*\n\nAptos offers several significant advantages that make it an ideal platform for high-demand applications. With its ability to handle over [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), it excels in supporting DeFi, real-time financial services, gaming, AI and other use cases. The platform's agile governance allows for rapid upgrades and swift implementation of new features. Additionally, Aptos ensures low and predictable fees through a stable fee model, and its use of the Move programming language enhances security with formal verification and resource-oriented programming. Built-in security features and automated auditing tools streamline the security process, while advanced state management techniques optimize data storage and access. Furthermore, Aptos simplifies integration with other blockchains through built-in interoperability, creating a cohesive and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos represents a groundbreaking expansion as it marks Aave’s first deployment on a non-EVM blockchain. This strategic move is significant as it opens up new technological frontiers, diversifies Aave’s ecosystem, and underscores its commitment to innovation.\n\nBy leveraging Aptos’ innovative technology and developer community, Aave can address diverse financial needs, attract new users, and drive greater innovation in the DeFi sector. This deployment aligns with the Aave community’s strategic goal to explore new technological possibilities and tap into a wider pool of talent and resources.\n\nKey benefits of deploying Aave V3 on Aptos include:\n\n1. First Non-EVM Deployment:\n\n  * This deployment is a significant milestone as Aave’s first move beyond EVM-compatible blockchains. It positions Aave to explore and integrate with new blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its resilience and broadening its reach.\n\n2. Early Mover Advantage and Strong Brand:\n\n  * Aave is a leading brand in the DeFi space, with a strong reputation and market share. By deploying on Aptos, Aave captures early mover advantages on a high-performance blockchain, similar to its strategic expansions to Polygon and other L2s. This can attract both seasoned DeFi users and new participants exploring Aptos.\n\n3. Aptos' Strategic Position:\n\n  * The Aptos team, with their background from Meta's Diem project, has strong connections and expertise in finance, social and gaming sectors. Integrating Aave into Aptos complements these areas by adding a mature financial layer, essential for a complete blockchain ecosystem.\n\n4. High Transaction Throughput:\n\n  * Aptos supports up to [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), crucial for DeFi protocols like Aave that handle a high volume of transactions, including loans, repayments, and interest accruals. This high throughput can significantly enhance user experience and enable new use cases that require high-frequency transactions.\n\n5. Enhanced Security with Move Language:\n\n  * Aave v3 introduces sophisticated risk management tools and improved security protocols. The Move programming language used by Aptos has inherent security advantages, such as preventing reentrancy attacks. This alignment can lead to a more secure DeFi lending environment, leveraging Move's safety features and formal verification.\n\n6.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 MVP deployment on Neon EVM Mainnet\n\nAuthor: Neon Foundation & Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of Aave V3 MVP on the NEON EVM Mainnet, expanding Aave’s presence and enabling access to unaddressed users, liquidity, community and ecosystem of Solana.\n\n# Background:\n\nNeon EVM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment solution built on the Solana blockchain which makes it the first parallelized EVM with direct access to Solana liquidity. Neon EVM allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps on Solana and access its native ecosystem and network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities without changing their codebases. Neon EVM currently has interoperability with Solana SPL tokens and the plan is to develop full interoperability with Solana smart contracts as well in 2024.\n\nSolana is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. Solana ecosystem took a hit due to market conditions and FTX situation last year as TVL fell from all-time high of +$9b to +$250m in July 2023 but since then it has shown strong growth and it’s the fastest growing ecosystem across major blockchain networks. Current TVL is over $1.5b making it the fifth-largest chain by TVL.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave has emerged as a prominent player in DeFi lending across various EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, including Ethereum, alt L1s, and L2s. Neon EVM wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Neon EVM Mainnet to expand lending to the Solana ecosystem. Aave’s expansion to the largest non-EVM ecosystem will further reinforce its place as the top liquidity market on-chain and open up possibilities for growth and collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and Neon EVM communities.\n\nAave V3 deployment on Neon EVM will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Solana and enables Solana ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through Neon EVM. The platform will allow Aave to deploy on Solana without any reconfiguration of the Aave v3 codebase and hence without incurring major development efforts and costs to the Aave DAO. Also, a third-party team has already deployed Aave V3 fork on Neon EVM Devnet which implies the full compatibility of Aave V3 codebase with Neon EVM.\n\nThese benefits of Neon EVM combined with Aave’s impressive push for a cross-chain future, provide an exciting opportunity to capture the market share of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and grow the user base and community of the protocol, increase TVL, and protocol revenue. At the same time, Neon EVM would benefit from having a trusted, flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users and wider Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe deployment of Aave v3 on the Neon EVM would enable Aave to tap into the Solana DeFi market and make a unique and significant contribution to the decentralized finance movement. This deployment is expected to substantially reduce costs and better scalability in comparison to EVM networks, while also providing users with access to Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. As Solana gains momentum as a prominent blockchain platform, the integration of Aave’s advanced lending and borrowing protocol could further catalyze the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and Neon EVM.\n\nThere have been significant concerns around the Downtime of Solana blockchain in the past but continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new tools are rolling out on a continuous basis to make the network more resilient, efficient and scalable. For e.g. Firedancer 2 by Jump Crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of Aave v3 deployment on Neon EVM was also recently mentioned by Stani and contributing teams like Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). Tweet by Stani 26, Tweet by Marc Zeller 25\n\nAdditionally, Neon EVM also recently announced the launch of Neon Points Program 10 to attract users and builders to accelerate the adoption of the network. We will include Aave in our points program to incentivize user activity on Aave v3 on Neon EVM with boosted points.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Mainnet with limited deployment of initial assets and conservative risk parameters.This approach will enable Aave to strategically establish a presence in the Solana ecosystem while minimizing risk exposure.\n\nThe proposal suggests three collaterals (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL 1) and one borrowable asset (USDC) with no isolated mode, e-mode enabled for correlated assets (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL), conservative LTV and supply, borrow caps. If this proposal is to pass, we will conduct a comprehensive technical risk assessment for the suggested assets at the ARFC phase to determine their risk parameters. We also invite risk service providers and community members to provide their analysis.\n\n# Infraestructure\n\n- Documentation: [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/quick_start)\n\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Neon EVM supports almost all standards. Here is the link to supported JSON-RPC - [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods)\n\n- Indexers: theGraph\n\n- Oracles: Chainlink, Pyth\n\n- Wallets: Metamask, Ledger and support other EVM network wallets.\n\n- Block explorers: [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/),  [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/)\n\n- Address formatting: It is the same as the standard Ethereum address.\n\n- On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Friendly fork of Gnosis Safe.\n\n- Cross-chain Interactions: [deBridge](https://debridge.finance/) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance/status/1737812739320599032), expected to go live on Mainnet in January)\n\n- NeonPass: NeonPass links Solana and Neon EVM to provide a smoother EVM-compatibility experience for end users (https://neonpass.live/). NeonPass is the revolving door of liquidity between Solana and Neon EVM. NeonPass is not a bridge connecting two separate blockchain ecosystems. Rather, it acts as a two-way transfer tool for bringing assets in and out of the Neon EVM platform, which itself is a Solana smart contract directly connected to the network.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Neon Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Neon Foundation and holds SOL, NEON tokens.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM and proceed with Snapshot if positive.\n\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n# Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave V3 on Mode \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-23\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nMode is a state-of-the-art, modular L2 blockchain that builds on the Ethereum network via deployment on the OP Superchain. \n\nDeploying Aave on Mode involves setting up a new instance of the Aave protocol on the Mode L2 blockchain, which is positioned to be the DeFi hub of the OP Superchain. This proposal aims to leverage Mode's modular infrastructure tailored for DeFi applications, offering potential enhancements in scalability and interoperability within the ecosystem.\n\n## **Motivation/Background**\n\nMode intends to be the DeFi hub of the Superchain, offering a best-in-class yield experience by attracting cutting edge and innovative DeFi protocols to weave into and build atop of a solid foundation of trusted blue chip favorites, Velodrome, Balancer en route, and (hopefully soon-to-be) Aave.\n\nMode stands apart in its approach to DeFi and liquidity architecture by working closely with stalwart protocols and teams to push integrations and intra-chain operability. By keeping an extremely active presence in the telegram channels and engaging in transformative open dialogue, Mode harnesses the collective wisdom of its builders to design an L2 every DeFi user would be proud to call home. Mode currently has baked-in incentives to help bootstrap early protocols via an ongoing metric based DevDrop which is redistributed to users, as well as Sequencer Fee Sharing, which passes a portion of fees back to the protocols.\n\nSince its Mainnet inception in early 2024, Mode has attracted significant TVL from the BTC L2 ecosystems as well as popular LRTs in the Ethereum AVS sector. Mode has risen into the Top 15 by TVL on DefiLlama, with a current USDC stablecoin dominance. The next priority is supporting more yield bearing assets, both volatile and stable, to enable automated vault strategies, yield markets, and more powerful index synthetics.\n\n### **1. Benefits of deploying to Mode:**\n\n**Scalability**:\n\n- Utilizes Mode's L2 solutions to reduce gas fees and transaction times, enhancing user experience and adoption.\n- Mode has been recognized for having some of the most affordable transaction rates among Layer 2 solutions, which can significantly attract more users to Aave.\n\n**Security**:\n\n- Features a robust multisig management system with oversight from the Mode Security Council, the Optimism Security Council, and the Optimism Foundation.\n- This setup prevents unilateral control over significant changes, providing a secure and stable environment for financial operations.\n- Includes rapid incident response capabilities through a partnership with Optimism, enabling quick technical interventions and smart contract upgrades to maintain system integrity.\n\n**Interoperability**:\n\n- Boasts EVM compatibility and is equipped with LayerZero OFT technology (with upcoming CCIP enablement), facilitating seamless integrations and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem and extending to Bitcoin L2s (like Merlin chain).\n\n**Strategic Significance**:\n\n- Aligns with Mode's modular infrastructure which is optimized for scalability and interoperability, enhancing the overall functionality and reach of Aave.\n- Supports Mode's strategic goals to become the DeFi hub of the Superchain, leveraging its ecosystem to foster significant growth and innovation for both Aave and Mode.\n- Compelling access to BTC synthetics, leveraging Mode’s maturing relationship with Bitcoin Layer 2s.\n- Deploying one of the fastest growing L2s in the space, Mode currently sits within the Top 15 by TVL on DefiLlama.\n\n### **2. Why it makes sense for Aave and Mode to pursue this new deployment.**\n\n**Effects on Liquidity**\n\n- **Increased Asset Pool**: Integration with Mode L2 allows Aave to leverage Mode’s significant m-BTC liquidity and other assets, potentially enhancing the variety and volume in Aave’s lending markets.\n- **Diverse Liquidity Sources**: The presence of synthetic Bitcoin as well as popular LRTs already on Mode broaden the liquidity base, making Aave’s market more versatile.\n\n**User Adoption**\n\n- **Lowered Cost and Enhanced UX**: Mode’s low transaction fees and optimized user interface are likely to attract both existing and new DeFi users to Aave, increasing the protocol’s adoption.\n- **Community Engagement**: Mode’s proactive community outreach and education will aid in effectively onboarding new users to Aave, fostering a deeper understanding and longer-term user retention. Established DeFi players also feel more comfortable depositing in AAVE versus newer protocols, which should spur growth.\n\n**Overall Market Growth**\n\n- **Market Expansion**: Aave’s integration into Mode’s DeFi-centric infrastructure contributes significantly to the broader adoption and growth of the DeFi market on Mode L2, likely to attract fresh capital from other chains who were otherwise waiting for Aave’s deployment.\n- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Mode’s infrastructure supports higher transaction volumes and operational efficiency, a boost for Aave’s scalability and ability to serve more users without compromising on performance.\n\n**Impact on Mode's Liquidity**\n\n- **Enhanced Platform Value**: Aave’s robust lending options add substantial value to Mode’s platform, enhancing overall liquidity and financial activity.\n- **Synergistic Effects**: Aave’s deployment can attract additional protocols and assets that seek to utilize Aave’s liquidity in yield-bearing architecture, thereby enriching Mode’s entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Contribution to Aave's Growth**\n\n- **Strategic Expansion**: Deploying on Mode aligns with Aave’s strategy to innovate within the DeFi space, using Mode’s advanced L2 solutions to access new markets and user bases.\n- **Long-term Benefits**: Integration with Mode’s diverse assets and user-friendly infrastructure is expected to sustain Aave’s growth and presence in the competitive DeFi market.\n\n### **3. Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMode will take several steps in ensuring deep liquidity is deposited to Aave upon deployment.\n\n- Mode will integrate Aave into the Mode dashboard (100,000 daily visits) and points program, which has been a key driver of TVL for Mode applications.\n- Mode will work with existing and new LPs to bootstrap pools.\n- Mode will work with LRT partners to include Aave in ongoing dual incentive campaigns\n- Mode will include Aave in Optimism related incentive campaigns\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nWebsite: https://www.mode.network/\n\nL2 Beat: https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/modeDefiLlama: https://defillama.com/chain/Mode\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Activate and Deploy GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-27\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis proposal aims to establish a dedicated Safety Module for GHO, Aave's native stablecoin, on Arbitrum, to enhance the security and stability of the Aave Protocol.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module (GSM) will be similar to the existing Aave Safety Module (SM), providing an additional layer of protection against shortfall events and incentivizing stakeholders through rewards by using and staking GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nDeploying the GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum aligns with Aave's strategic goals of fostering a secure and scalable environment for its stablecoin. This proposal leverages Arbitrum's technological advantages and financial incentives, setting a solid foundation for GHO's growth and stability.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe [GHO Safety Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635) was created with the aim of mitigating risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events, thereby fortifying the Aave Protocol’s resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversified the Safety Module’s capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nCreating a GHO SM on Arbitrum responds to several factors:\n\n1. Scalability and low fees\n2. Strong Ecosystem and Liquidity injection\n\nCreating a GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum will ensure support and liquidity for GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nTo provide more context, Aave DAO recently received a Long Term Incentive Pilot Program Grant of 750K ARB from Arbitrum DAO, in order to expand GHO into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe funds would be used as follows:\n\n- 375K ARB distributed over a 12-week period amounts to around 1% additional yield to users. While this could be higher, it will be meaningful enough to make ETH and GHO borrows sufficiently attractive to boost TVL and borrow metrics.\n- 375K ARB used for GHO liquidity mining rewards. To target a sufficient size of GHO liquidity on the network, reward rates will need to be similar to mainnet. The GHO Liquidity Committee has used a mix of incentives to keep GHO at peg. We expect that a similar yield will be needed to manage the GHO peg on Arbitrum.\n\nTogether, these two uses of the grant funds should increase TVL and borrowing demand on Arbitrum. Arbitrum will be one of the most attractive networks to borrow on Aave due to the borrowing incentives. It will be the most appealing L2 to borrow and use GHO when it goes cross-chain.\n\nAnother example is the recent approval by Aave DAO of the [GHO Cross-Chain Launch strategy for the GHO](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2a6ffbcff41a5ef98b7542f99b207af9c1e79e61f859d0a62f3bf52d3280877a) stablecoin, the native asset of the Aave Protocol, beginning with the initial expansion to the Arbitrum network. This expansion will utilize the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).\n\n### **Specification**\n\n1. **Deployment of GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum**:\n    - Establish the GHO SM smart contracts on Arbitrum to manage and protect GHO assets.\n    - Integrate Chainlink oracles for accurate and reliable price feeds.\n2. **Incentive Program**:\n    - Utilize ARB incentives to bootstrap GHO liquidity and adoption on Arbitrum.\n    - Implement liquidity mining programs and other yield strategies to attract and retain GHO holders.\n3. **Merit Incentive Program**:\n    - Stakeholders who participate in staking GHO on Arbitrum will be eligible for Merit rewards. The Merit program is designed to incentivize both borrowing and staking GHO. The rewards will enhance user participation and the overall security of the GHO ecosystem on Arbitrum.\n\n### Useful Links:\n\n[**[ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO**](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635)\n\n**[Aave LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a4d8072fce74d8fc069cf0ca33fb6348e3aa66ab6369dd3dbcaaff01f2cebbd)**\n\n**[[Aave] LTIPP Application](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741)**\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nACI is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not being compensated for creating this TEMP CHECK.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-26\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\nThis proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nArtemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 30.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Website](https://artemisfinance.io)\n\n[X](https://x.com/Artemisfinance)\n\nDocuments:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/)\n\nAudit Report:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit)\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
