This testnet deployment was done for testing purposes by the @AaveCompanies team.\n\nSince ZkEVM is EVM-equivalent, deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work.\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative supports L2 diversity as part of its governance platform.\n\nThis minimal Aave V3 deployment, with strictly limited assets onboarding (”MVP V3”), can be an opportunity to establish a strategic Aave presence early in this new network while staying conservative in terms of risk.\n\nThis ARFC proposal should be considered as a \"temperature check\" that would allow development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the zkEVM network.\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to “temp check” the deployment of a MVP version of Aave V3 on the ZkEVM L2.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe proposal to deploy Aave V3.0.1 on the ZkEVM L2 network, also known as \"MVP V3,\" presents an opportunity for Aave Governance to establish a strategic presence on this new network early on. Aave has a history of pioneering in new frontiers, starting with the Polygon & Avalanche V2 deployment in 2021.\n\nZkEVM is an L2 solution developed by the Polygon team that is EVM-equivalent. Deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work. However, to reduce risk, the proposal suggests limiting asset onboarding and setting conservative risk parameters. This will enable development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the ZkEVM network. The proposal recommends onboarding only three collaterals (WETH, WMATIC & USDC) and one borrowable asset (USDC) to reduce risk exposure.\n\nIt is important to note that the presented risk parameters should be considered as suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\nThis proposal also lays the groundwork for an \"MVP\" L2 GHO facilitator if governance considers this option in the future.\n\nOverall, this proposal has the potential to expand Aave's reach in the DeFi space by allowing it to expand to new \"frontier\" networks.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy an “MVP V3” of Aave V3.0.1 with only three collaterals: WETH, WMATIC & USDC, and only one borrowable asset: USDC.\n\n| Risk Parameter | WETH | MATIC | USDC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES |\n| Stable borrowing | N/A | N/A | NO |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 65% | 82.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 70% | 85% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 10% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | 20,000,000 |\n| Supply Cap | 25,000 | 15,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 7% | 6.1% | 4% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% | 75% | 90% |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 100% | 60% |\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by Polygon for publishing this AFRC.\n\nHowever, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, is a compensated DeFi strategy advisor for the Polygon Foundation. Although this AFRC is not specifically part of his role, it could be interpreted as such.\n\nAs part of its delegate platform, the ACI promotes L2 diversity.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Marc Zeller holds MATIC, the native asset of the Polygon protocol, and MaticX, a LSD of MATIC, as well as significant holdings on the Polygon POS blockchain, worth approximately $250k.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",

Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3\n\nUSDT is currently one of the largest V2 stablecoin reserve with ~335m$ supplied\n\nMotivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Tether or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided introduce USDT as a non-collateral asset.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same as for USDT in V2. for now.\nThe ACI is supportive of onboarding USDT as it was in V2.\nFor now, the ACI doesn’t consider V3 mature enough to activate a USD stablecoins emode and consider USDT in it.\nAlso, supply and borrow caps are suggested for this asset to limit risk exposure.\nThey’re currently set to allow reserve utilization to cross the Uoptimal point slightly. But @ChaosLabs & @Pauljlei input is valuable on this.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed.

After years of functioning as intended and witnessing the growth of USDC in the DeFi ecosystem, it seems that reasons for exclusion have fewer grounds in the current DeFi ecosystem and pragmatic approach would be to onboard it in a conservative way and make risk parameters evolve based on market data.\nWhile this ARC doesn’t present a proposal to add USDT as collateral, the ACI thinks the community should consider this as something to discuss at a later stage when V3 will have more maturity.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
