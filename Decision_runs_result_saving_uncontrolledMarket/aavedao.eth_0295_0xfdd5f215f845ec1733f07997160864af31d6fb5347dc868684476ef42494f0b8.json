        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.

With a proven track record of thorough risk analysis, an unbiased approach, and an unwavering commitment to the success of our partner protocols, we have earned the trust and endorsement of those we work with.\n\nLlamaRisk was established in 2021 as a service to Curve DAO and its LPs, providing risk transparency analyses of assets listed on Curve, including stablecoins, RWAs (Real World Assets), LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens), and LRTs (Liquid Restaking Tokens). In 2023, we partnered with Prisma Finance to develop a comprehensive framework for assessing LST collateral risk, which we have used to produce detailed analyses for onboarding assets onto the protocol. We have since expanded our suite of risk management solutions with agent-based simulations and DeFi strategy management.\n\n### Motivation\n\nLlamaRisk is a DeFi-native risk firm that understands the delicate balance protocols face to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape without sacrificing responsible, sustainable practices. \n\nOur core values are transparency and accountability. When armed with reliable and objective information, DAOs and their users are equipped to take action in their best interest. Therefore, our duty is to consistently demonstrate sound reasoning based on thorough analysis that our partners have come to depend on.\n\nLlamaRisk has distinguished itself through:\n\n- **Long-form Comprehensive Risk Analysis:** Over the last two years, we have published over 70 long-form risk assessments in the public domain. Our procedures and QA/QC processes ensure we present clear, unbiased information.\n- **Governance & Parameterization Recommendation:** We have a longstanding history of providing consultation for our risk analyses. Our detailed reports, along with a hands-on approach, have informed critical decisions within our partner DAOs.\n- **Diversity of DeFi Knowledge:** Our team understands many protocol architectures, especially concerning stablecoins, liquid staking derivatives, and pegged assets generally. This knowledge comes from extensive research, development, and hands-on experience with various DeFi protocols, enabling us to anticipate and mitigate risks effectively.\n- C**ommitment to Innovation:** At LlamaRisk, we continually evolve our methodologies and tools to stay at the forefront of DeFi research and risk management, ensuring our strategies are effective.\n\n### Specification\n\nRecognizing the significance of a dual risk provider model, LlamaRisk's proposal is designed to complement Chaos Labs' risk services, with whom we plan to collaborate extensively. \n\nThe initial 6-month engagement, which may be extended pending DAO approval, involves the following scope:\n\n- **On-demand Risk Assessments:** LlamaRisk will deliver prompt and in-depth risk assessments for assets listed or considered to be listed on Aave with particular emphasis on the collateral types comprising the GHO stablecoin. This will involve developing a custom framework tailored specifically to the categories of relevant assets and Aave's needs, which will standardize the assessment process.\n- **Collaborative Engagement with Chaos Labs:** We plan to collaborate extensively with Chaos Labs, combining our expertise to provide Aave with comprehensive and nuanced risk analysis, enhancing the protocol's risk management capacity.\n- **Active Involvement in DAO Governance:** LlamaRisk will actively participate in Aave's DAO governance, offering informed insights and strategic recommendations on risk management practices for principal stakeholders and the community.\n- **Legal Regulatory Advisory and Policy Work:** We will offer specialized legal research and regulatory guidance, including a thorough analysis of evolving legal frameworks and regulatory policies, and equip Aave with the necessary foresight to navigate the regulatory landscape of the DeFi sector effectively.\n\nRisk vectors are diverse and cannot be fully managed by qualitative risk tools. That is why we specialize in comprehensive risk assessment of tokenized assets and DeFi protocols. Our work supports our partners in making informed decisions that mitigate potential threats and promote a culture of transparency and sustainability. Our team of experts meticulously evaluate various risk factors, including but not limited to:\n\n- Protocol design and architecture\n- Tokenomics and economic incentives\n- Smart contract security\n- Governance mechanisms\n- Regulatory compliance\n\nLlamaRisk leverages advanced simulation techniques, including statistical and agent-based modeling, to test and validate DeFi protocols and their collateral assets under various stress scenarios. Our simulations provide valuable insights into potential risks, allowing our partner protocols to set competitive parameters resilient to adverse market conditions.\n\nOur DeFi strategy managers employ data analytics and risk monitoring tools that allow us to maintain high efficiency and safety standards. We support our partners with publications and dashboards that give users the information they need to interact with the protocol responsibly.\n\nOur advisory services cater to the unique needs of DeFi projects, providing strategic guidance and support throughout their lifecycle. From ideation to implementation, our experienced advisors offer expert advice on protocol design, tokenomics, governance, and risk management strategies, ensuring optimal outcomes for our partners.\nComment\n\nTraversing the complex regulatory landscape is crucial for DeFi protocols and projects. Our team of legal experts provides in-depth analysis and guidance to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate legal risks, assist with regulatory filings, and help clients develop robust strategies for operating within the evolving regulatory framework.\n\nWe actively engage in policy development and legislative processes related to crypto and blockchain at national, supranational, and international levels. This includes participating in specialized working groups, contributing opinions to public discussions on regulatory developments, and involvement in policymaking dialogues. We aim to ensure that DeFi stakeholders are represented and protected in the evolving regulatory landscape, facilitating informed and proactive responses to legislative changes.\n\n### Duration & Proposed Budget\n\nWe propose a flexible retainer model for our collaboration, with an initial 6-month commitment. This model is designed to ensure maximum efficiency in resource utilization, with a commitment to transparency and responsible financial management.\n\nThe budget request is $250,000 for a 6-month engagement.\n\nDetailed quarterly reports on our spending will be provided, with any unused funds either carried over to the next quarter or returned to the Aave DAO, as preferred.\n\nOverall, this proposed scope is an opportunity for LlamaRisk to demonstrate its ability to make an appreciable improvement in Aave's risk management, which is a pragmatic and cost-effective onboarding strategy. It also serves as an introduction to building a working relationship with Chaos Labs and DAO stakeholders. We intend to demonstrate our value throughout a 6-month engagement and expand our suite of services as pain points are identified. \n\nWe are a flexible and agile team ready to work together to provide risk management solutions that will suit Aave's specific needs within the wider organization of service providers and stakeholders making up the DAO.\n\n### Useful Links\n\nYou can find in this section links to our work:\n\n- [Curve Gauge Risk Substack](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/) (CryptoRisk Assessments): We publicize research related to assets with Curve pools (mostly stablecoins and RWAs) with attention to risks to the Curve gauge and governance system\n- [PrismaRisk Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@PrismaRisk): We publicize comprehensive collateral risk assessments for proposed collateral assets on Prisma Finance (LSTs and LRTs)\n- [LlamaRisk Hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk): We publicize comprehensive collateral risk assessments for potential collateral assets for Curve crvUSD\n- ArcadiaSim: [Update 1](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation),  [Update 2](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-d98), [Update 3](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-388), [Update 4](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-42d) & [Update 5](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/arcadia-collateral-risk-simulation-3fa)\n- [Sturdy Finance crvUSD Aggregator](https://v2.sturdy.finance/aggregators/ethereum/0x73E4C11B670Ef9C025A030A20b72CB9150E54523/deposit): Sturdy V2 app of the aggregator managed by LlamaRisk\n- [Aggregator Dune Dash](https://dune.com/llamarisk/sturdy-crvusd-aggregator-monitoring): LlamaRisk dashboard monitoring the aggregator and underlying assets\n- [Aggregator Oracle Explainer](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/sturdy-finance-crvusd-aggregator): Publication on Sturdy silos Oracle design\n- [Response to FCA Discussion Paper DP23/4](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/llama-risk-response-to-fca-discussion): Our response to the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Discussion Paper on Regulating Cryptoassets Phase 1: Stablecoins\n- [DeFi Yield Optimizers](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/llama-legal-defi-yield-optimizers): The legal status of DeFi yield optimizers under the EU crypto regulatory framework\n- [SubDAO Legal Entity Formation](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/subdao-legal-entity-formation): Llama Risk resources for DAO sub-orgs in search of suitable legal structures\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Our methodologies are rooted in an integrative approach, offering protocol robustness and protecting funds from market risks through dynamic risk parameter recommendations. We provide a holistic approach encompassing software and services to mitigate risks in volatile markets, countering economic attacks on the protocol and ensuring the secure preservation of user funds.\n\n## Scope\n\n### **Risk Parameter Optimization**\n\nDeploying our custom agent-based simulation platform, proprietary methodologies, and a distinguished team of data scientists and researchers, we provide the community with comprehensive analyses and recommendations for risk parameter settings and strategies. Our paramount goal is to optimize protocol revenue while protecting user funds and mitigating potential risk vectors. Chaos Labs will thoroughly analyze the ecosystem and build custom agent-based simulations. These simulations leverage protocol dynamics and on-chain behaviors to pressure test and optimize the protocol, identifying potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for improvement. Thorough system analysis yields a comprehensive understanding of the factors that impact protocol health and stability, enabling us to make data-driven optimization and risk management recommendations. \n\nCoverage includes support for all Aave risk parameters, including Liquidation Thresholds, LTV, Liquidation Bonus, Supply and Borrow Caps, Debt Ceilings, and Interest Rate Curves.\n\n**Parameter Recommendation Platform**\n\nThe Chaos Labs Parameter Recommendation Portal is designed to provide the Aave community with a comprehensive understanding of the simulation outputs and underlying data to optimize risk parameter settings. By providing a clear and intuitive interface that highlights the impact of different parameter settings on risk and return, we can foster a more informed and engaged community, facilitating ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing. \n\nIn addition to presenting the data outputs from the Chaos Simulation Engine, the Parameter Recommendation Portal offers users unparalleled access to the underlying simulation mechanics and implications, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the simulations and their results.\n\n### **Risk Monitoring and Alerting**\n\nWe offer real-time monitoring and alerting services through the [Chaos Labs Risk Monitoring Platform](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/ccar/overview). These services allow users to assess ecosystem risk and protocol health at granular levels using dashboards and data visualizations. Users can drill into specific scenarios in which the protocol could be negatively impacted and receive alerts concerning significant changes to on-chain activities that could pose a risk or detriment to the protocol's health. \n\nAs part of our commitment to delivering a world-class risk management solution for the DeFi ecosystem, we constantly iterate and improve on the platform with additional features and enhancements. The Aave community will continue to gain access to the newest feature additions and enhancements continuously, allowing users to stay ahead of the curve and make informed decisions while optimizing their overall portfolio performance.\n\n### Deprecation of V2 and Migration to V3\n\nChaos Labs has spearheaded several community initiatives to deprecate the V2 markets and facilitate the transition to V3, as outlined in the 'Background' section. \n\nAs we progress with the deprecation plan and migration efforts, we are committed to continue allocating resources and offering the community recommendations for proactively adjusting V2 parameters. This includes updates to Liquidation Thresholds, Reserve Factors and enhancing the capital efficiency of V3 markets to ensure a seamless migration of positions from V2. \n\nGiven the extended nature of the transition to V3, it remains imperative to uphold proactive risk management for V2 during this transitional phase.\n\n### **Protocol Growth**\n\nChaos Labs will provide integral support to the protocol growth initiatives through detailed market risk assessments and parameter recommendations for new asset listings and deployments.\n\nAs we onboard new assets and deployments, the Chaos team will seamlessly integrate them into our systems to facilitate continuous monitoring and parameter optimization. We uphold the same high standard for all assets and deployments, ensuring consistency and excellence across the board. Our goal is to provide unwavering support for the protocol's expansion and sustainability.\n\n### GHO\n\nFollowing the initial launch of GHO, Chaos Labs is committed to the continued growth and safety of the stablecoin and will provide ongoing support, including:\n\n- **Parameter Optimization** - we will conduct data-driven research and simulations to recommend optimizations for GHO-specific parameters, including Borrow rate, stkAAVE discount rate, bucket capacities, GSM, and DEX liquidity goals. Additionally, Chaos Labs will extend its current V3 Ethereum Asset Listing framework to include rigorous analysis of how new asset types can affect GHO composition and stability.\n- **Ongoing Risk Management, Monitoring, and Analytics -** We will continue iterations on our unified risk monitoring and alerting platform for GHO across primary markets (Aave), including all facilitators and secondary markets (centralized and decentralized exchanges). Our risk management services include economic reviews of GHO and ecosystem adoption across primary and secondary markets, peg stability, GHO backing composition, and more.\n- **Facilitator's Risk Framework, Recommendations, and Monitoring** - we will create a risk framework to consider potential facilitators and their corresponding GHO credit lines and provide ongoing risk analysis for potential and existing facilitators based on this framework.\n- **And more**\n\n### Chaos Team Support\n\nAs part of our services, we assign a dedicated protocol manager supported by our world-class team of researchers and data scientists to lead all risk-related communications and inquiries with the Aave community.\n\nOur team support typically covers two main areas: ongoing management and incident response. In the event of any incidents or issues, our team will be on hand to provide timely and effective incident response, minimizing the potential impact on the protocol and its users.\n\n**Ongoing and Proactive Risk Management**\n\nThis includes detailed analyses of new asset onboarding, assessing the potential risks and benefits of launching in new markets and providing a thorough understanding of parameter recommendations, including qualitative data and position analysis. \n\n**Incident Response**\n\n This includes supporting various events, including liquidity changes, asset depegs, price volatilities, etc. Our team provides ongoing support in these events, including market monitoring and alerting, ad-hoc risk analysis, and recommendations on risk-mitigating actions.\n\nOur team of experts brings a wealth of experience in risk management and data analysis, enabling us to provide the insights and recommendations necessary to navigate even the most challenging market conditions. By working closely with the community, we can provide the support and guidance necessary to promote Aave’s long-term success and sustainability.\n\n## Communications:\n\n- Our team will share our recommendations and analyses through dedicated governance forum discussions, maintaining transparency and facilitating effective communication with the community.\n- We commit to providing a monthly update post, highlighting completed work and outlining our future areas of focus.\n- We are consistently available for community calls and regularly schedule check-up calls with Aave delegates. These calls primarily focus on addressing risk-related inquiries, offering insights into existing proposals, and gathering general feedback.\n\n## Terms\n\n- 12-month engagement, November 13th 2023-November 13th, 2024\n- $1.6M, streamed linearly throughout the engagement.\n    - Given community preference, we suggest the full amount to be paid in GHO but are open to any composition of stables/AAVE tokens.\n\n## Specification:\n\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with a Chaos Labs-controlled account (`0xbC540e0729B732fb14afA240aA5A047aE9ba7dF0`) as the recipient.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a stream of 1,600,000 aUSDC or GHO for a 12-month duration.\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nChaos Labs provides ongoing risk management services to several other borrowing/lending protocols, such as Benqi, Venus, Tapioca, and Tashi. These commitments do not interfere with our responsibilities concerning our association with Aave. We conscientiously provide explicit disclaimers and relevant context in any proposals that may influence clientele across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n# Next steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, we are targeting a Snapshot vote on November 1st, 2023.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) on November 8th, 2023.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum \nAuthor: Kelp DAO & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-02-20\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 470 Mn+ (~168k Eth) TVL\n- 18K restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH and sfrxETH and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >12 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $4 Mn\n    - [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-67/deposit) - $4 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x64939a882c7d1b096241678b7a3a57ed19445485) - $3.2 Mn\n    - [Maverick](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions/0x1b06f8fc94b95b6a8075aa1dcf12e69c70144c52?chain=1) - $0.9 Mn\n- $3.5 Mn average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 17th Feb)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nExchange rate is calculated basis the formula:\n\nrseth / eth = [(asset amount in protocol * asset price in ETH)rsETH total supply]\n\nrsEth relies on multiple contract exchange rates for:\n\n1. stEth: As this is a rebasing token, the balance of stETH changes over time and the asset price is taken as 1stETH = 1 ETH.\n\n2. ETHx: Asset price is taken from getExchangeRate( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf5EA1b38380f6aF39068375516Daf40Ed70D299#readProxyContract\n\n3. Sfrxeth: Asset price is taken from pricePerShare( ) method in -  https://etherscan.io/token/0xac3e018457b222d93114458476f3e3416abbe38f\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nAs of today, the only way to exit rsETH is via DEXs. KelpDAO is going to enable withdrawals by mid-March 2024 after which users can withdraw Eth or any LSTs via KelpDAO dapp.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n- Contract Address: [0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n- [Github Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Kelp DAO and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal. \n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] New Chain Deployment Framework\nAuthor: @0xTogbe - Aave Chan Initiative\nCreated: 2023-11-28\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks the community’s approval for a framework to deploy the Aave Protocol on a new blockchain.\nThis framework outlines the standardized process for any blockchain seeking to deploy on Aave Protocol. The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired.

The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Integration Review: Outline the technical details of the proposed integration. This includes specifics on how Aave’s lending and borrowing functionalities will interact with new Aave Deployment. For that, please share the result of both documentation submission and technical review, from TEMP CHECK, so community can understand the level of work, security and commitment. Avoid providing sensitive information.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for ARFC phase, that has been as well implemented in TEMP CHECK stage, to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments.\n\nTo be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not, and details\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n\nSpecification: Include the initial assets that should be available as collateral and their risk parameters in a table. These should have received input from at least one risk manager service provider.\n\nDeployment Checklist: New deployments must have all of the following completed prior to posting an ARFC.\n\n- Risk service providers feedback\n- BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation\n- Oracle recommendation\n- The graph support\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nStatement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nRefine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\nIf consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\nIf consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 on the new chain.\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\n# Next Steps\n- Community Engagement: Engage with the Aave community to gather feedback on the proposed framework for new Aave v3 deployments.\n- ARFC Snapshot: If community sentiment is favorable, initiate an ARFC snapshot to gauge official support for the framework.\n- Implementation: Since this is a governance framework ARFC, if it passes snapshot, it will be implemented as the framework standard for new chain deployments going forward.\n# Disclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",
