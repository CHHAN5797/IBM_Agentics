        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] GHO - Increase Borrow Rate\nauthor: @TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham & ACI - @MarcZeller\ncreated: 2023-10-30\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes increasing the GHO Borrow Rate from 3.00% to 4.72%, the proposed sDAI rate.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past week, the GHO peg has been gradually declining, while the supply has been increasing. Users have been minting GHO and subsequently exchanging it for other assets.\n\nIncremental interest rate hikes have not had the desired effect, evident by GHO price continuing to trade lower. The GHO borrowing rate remains significantly lower compared to other stablecoins.\n\nThis publication suggests aligning the GHO borrowing rate with the proposed sDAI rate, 4.72%. The aim is to reduce the borrowing discount of GHO relative to other stablecoins before returning to periodic 50bps increases.\n\nThe chart below shows the general GHO price downwards trend. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByIPGWaz6.png)\n\nThe below shows the borrow rate of GHO relative to other stable coins. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryZgQWazp.png)\n\nThe main types of collateral backing GHO are wstETH (29.68%), wETH (28.84%), wBTC (20.44%) and rETH (8.94%). For reference, sDAI makes up 2.07% of the collateral supporting GHO debt with a current APR of [5.0%](https://daistats.com/#/ecosystem) which is expected to adjust lower to 4.72%. A large portion of the collateral backing GHO is generating yield which acts to offset borrowing costs.\n\nBy increasing the borrow rate to 4.72%, the goal is to improve the peg by reducing the incentive to mint GHO relative to other stable coins. As a result, GHO's growth is expected to slow. This publication prioritises returning GHO to peg over growth. \n\nAfter implementing this proposal, the community can continue with the current plan, [direct-to-AIP process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/349/). \n\n# Specification\n\nAsset: GHO\nContract Address: [0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f)\nCurrent Borrow Rate: [3.00%](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1255fC8DC8E76761995aCF544eea54f1B7fB0459#readContract)\nProposed Borrow Rate: 4.72%\nNew discounted Borrow Rate: ~3.31%\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\nThe Aave Facilitator Bucket Level is to remain at 35.00M units\n\nThe AIP will be submitted by @marcZeller and the ACI team.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2) In 5 days scalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage.\n3) If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2022-12-17\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1]. As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode.\n\nThis proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens.\n\nUtilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 72.5%. At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAO’s revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost.\n\nIncreasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300%. Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility.\n\nThe breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative.\n\nThe capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3].\n\nBased upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65%. It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65%. The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZloZ51jG8cSo9pK37apk9xqwSnyM2T6WwKWEaimSNA8sVpcxxsRrQBYPf9F6DAFMzXPdlhRWwNePF_5kZrTEoZu8-rfk3CmDtTivdrrwTTQGrAe-ZoZ1to1PlsAaFfbkmQLeRdOAy0qukls3wJAXFgKgCA6TUd6jP2w6mbO4WWKOguI0RjWEQ7BkIg \"Chart\")\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the wMATIC Reserve.\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n|---|---|---|\n|Uoptimal|45%|75%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|6.1%|\n|Slope2|300%|100%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|20%|\n|Supply Cap|32.88M|47M|\n|Borrow Cap|9.23M|39.95M|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx\n[3] https://lido.fi/\n[4] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [4].",

At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is $36.2M and $134.7M respectively. For comparison, the Aave v3 deployment on each network is $199.8M and $229.9M respectively. \n\nBy removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments, Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment. By removing the SM coverage, users are further encouraged to migrate to v3.\n\nThe Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM. This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche. \n\nFor reference, at the time of writing, the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM:\n\n* Ethereum v2\n* [Ethereum v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2cbfeb5c5329c4d1720dbae4045386fceb2d2a9bd5b42a81cee47ea5c934f491)\n* [Polygon v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)\n* [Avalanche v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreiba2pdfwoesezgpedf37bjfgadxmaigavoulek5wayqb7f2tz6byy)\n* [Aave ARC](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreieeyh6pbqwhgryo6v67oxlmnfhaptrgkc3u7y6bvz2y3jdkxgrrh4)\n* [Polygon v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)\n\n\n# Specification\n\nIt is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM, an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event.\n\nThe following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting:\n\n* Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3\n* Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2\n* Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2\n\nUpon conclusion of the Snapshot vote, if approved, SM coverage will be removed/extended to the respective market.\n\nThere is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.
