As per previous arrangements between Balancer and Gnosis this pool shall not bear any protocol fees for the time being.\n\n### References/Useful links\n\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n\n[ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocols eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, however this will transition to permisionless based on the protocol roadmap.\n\nETH staked through the [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards, and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on [ether.fi](http://ether.fi/) automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\n\nDevelop additional liquidity for weETH on Arbitrum.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n\n#### Governance\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n#### Oracles\n\n* [weETH rate provider](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xCd9e3fb32c8F258555b8292531112bBb5B87E2F4)\n* [wstETH rate provider](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb1552c5e96b312d0bf8b554186f846c40614a540#readContract)\n\n#### Audits\n\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports).

        "title": "[BIP-616] Enable gauge for sDAI/aUSDC Rehype pool [Gnosis]",
        "author": "0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516",
        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1001\n\n### Summary \nThis is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC Rehype Pool on Gnosis Chain. \n\nRehype Pools hold at least one Aave deposit receipt token and thus allow LPs to receive the lending market yield, in addition to swap fee revenue, and third-party incentives. Rehype Pools build on top of the E-CLP's asymmetric concentrated liquidity profile, improving capital efficiency on two fronts. As per previous arrangements between Balancer and Gnosis this pool shall not bear any protocol fees for the time being.\n\n### References/Useful links\n* [Documentation of Rehype Pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n* \"Savings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\" - [Spark](https://docs.spark.fi/defi-infrastructure/sdai-overview)\n* aUSDC is the deposit receipt token issued by the [Aave](https://aave.com/) protocol to lenders of USDC. Since aTokens are rebasing, this pool uses BGD Labs's [statA wrapper](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3) that is a repricing representation of statA tokens that reflects the accruing lending yield.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\nGyroscope is expanding to Gnosis Chain.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n#### Governance\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n #### Oracles\n n/a\n\n#### Audits\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n#### Centralization vectors\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n\n## Value\nAs per “Motivation”.\n\n---\n\n#### Contracts\n- Rehype pool: [0x045200C6077f105023000D803F3F95B16B187D70](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0x045200c6077f105023000d803f3f95b16b187d70)\n- Childchain gauge on Gnosis Chain: [0xFd0D023CeDbb1690e6d602Bc051F06efED8460Dc](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xfd0d023cedbb1690e6d602bc051f06efed8460dc)\n- Gnosis Chain root gauge on Ethereum: [0xc6710f32c9524b4C6736fEae17BE7c88bB8fF87c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6710f32c9524b4C6736fEae17BE7c88bB8fF87c)\n\n---\n\n> Specification\n>\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n> gauge(address): `0xc6710f32c9524b4C6736fEae17BE7c88bB8fF87c`\n> gaugeType(string): `Gnosis`",
