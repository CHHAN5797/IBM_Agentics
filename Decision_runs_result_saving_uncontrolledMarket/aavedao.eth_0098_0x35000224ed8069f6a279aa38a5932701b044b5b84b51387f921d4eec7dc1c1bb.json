        "body": "Author: Peter from the Origin Protocol core team\nDate: 2024-09-18\n\n### 1. Simple Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding supply/borrow support for wOETH on:\n\n- Aave v3 Main Ethereum Instance\n\nIf the onboarding of OETH to Aave is successful, Origin hopes to discuss an additional onboarding of wOETH to:\n\n- Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Aave v3 EtherFi Instance\n\n### 2. Motivation/Background\n\n[Origin Ether](https://oeth.com/)(OETH) was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 that generates yield while sitting in your wallet. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nUntil a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0x76f64251d37310c5d241ec84a892751c7a34874faff7af848db193141ea24a6f) earlier this year, OETH was an LST aggregator that earned yield by tapping into blue-chip protocols while being collateralized by other LSTs. Over the weeks following, the ability to deploy OETH collateral to other projects was removed and LST collateral was divested back to ETH, as OETH transitioned into a full-fledged LST with an extremely tight peg (1:1 redemptions to ETH thru Origin's [ARM](https://www.originprotocol.com/arm-announcement)) and high yields thanks to DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p.\n\nWe've noticed many LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This will not be the case with OETH.\n\nUsing OETH on Aave will produce higher yield than other top LSTs and have a near perfect ETH peg. OETH ARM mechanics and gas optimizations will ensure the best possible prices for traders looking for instant exit liquidity, while DVT staking will achieve greater risk-adjusted yield. Our vision for OETH is for it to become the most trusted LST for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking.\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, users can convert their ETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on Curve OETH/ETH: [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on Uniswap OETH/ETH: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x52299416C469843F4e0d54688099966a6c7d720f)\n- Swapping on Curve OETH/frxETH: [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-353/deposit)\n\nwOETH is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the [contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192) (function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.\n\nCurrent exchange rate as of 9/18/24: 1 wOETH = 1.104402 OETH\n\n#### Security Considerations\n\nThere is no set emission schedule for OETH. Similar to stETH, OETH is minted on demand when users lock their ETH into the protocol, and burned on demand when users exit OETH for the collateral. The OETH protocol is upgradeable by a 5 of 8 multi-sig and there is a 48-hour timelock before any changes go into effect. You can read more about that in the [admin section](https://docs.originprotocol.com/ogn/governance#guardians) of the OETH docs.\n\nOETH and wOETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. All OETH audits can be found in the [audits section](https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits) of the OETH docs. We have recently retained [yAudit](https://yaudit.dev/) to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes. Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program is currently administered by [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/origindefi/), where Origin maintains a median resolution time of 6 hours.\n\nOETH/wOETH price feeds are available by ChainLink across Mainnet, Arbitrum and Base. OETH price feeds are also available via alternative oracle providers Tellor and Dia Data. OETH likely qualifies for a Correlated-Asset Price Oracle (CAPO) based on [similar LSTs](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-correlated-price-asset-onboarding/17012) that have qualified.\n\n#### Performance\n\nThe [current](https://www.originprotocol.com/analytics/oeth) OETH TVL sits comfortably at $71m with a native yield of 4.43% APY:\n\n![OETH TVL](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/83e3d47e8afac53131a7307367270c22178e6fa3.png)\n\nOETH features the highest native APY on [Defillama](https://defillama.com/lsd) for LST projects with over $6m in TVL. [Proof of Yield](https://www.originprotocol.com/analytics/oeth/proof-of-yield) tracks the distribution of each OETH rebase event and displays the compounded yield on an annualized basis each day:\n\n![OETH Yield](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfj6oiCgANQgEPMwHOg6M4incao6J-SZrcPgamdiodHLgRNlf5-H4cFM0JMgfSQLvEfUdsBF9piOGBUrw-LOhI0Q6gjVwpyb2FaLQaerkjeKnncj75ge3Vu0qxLang8goEmf4xMCGT4fhdddObGcY0Rcf9E?key=OkwF9J2919MS15O4njFUig)\n\nOrigin has managed to integrate and onboard OETH and wOETH to a range of verticals across Defi, including vaults, restaking, and money markets:\n\n- Eigenlayer - [Eigenlayer](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/token/oETH)\n- Karak - [Karak](https://app.karak.network/pool/ethereum/WOETH)\n- Pendle - [Pendle](https://app.pendle.finance/trade/markets/0x62187066fd9c24559ffb54b0495a304ade26d50b/swap?view=pt&chain=ethereum)\n- Morpho - [Morpho](https://app.morpho.org/market?network=mainnet&id=0xea023e57814fb9a814a5a9ee9f3e7ece5b771dd8cc703e50b911e9cde064a12d)\n- Silo - [Silo](https://app.silo.finance/silo/0x9f4D6f98F29c1D482bCF0F85683155E0B3e015f5)\n- Shezmu - [Shezmu](https://www.shezmu.io/oasis/collateral)\n- Fraxlend - [Fraxlend](https://app.frax.finance/fraxlend/available-pairs)\n- Dolomite - [Dolomite](https://app.dolomite.io/balances)\n- Euler - [Euler](https://app.euler.finance/vault/0x01d1a1cd5955B2feFb167e8bc200A00BfAda8977)\n\n#### Benefits of listing OETH\n\n[Since 2021](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5e3646a1db86993f73e6b74a57d8640b69f7e259), Origin has streamed millions of dollars in stablecoin to Aave markets via OUSD strategies, generating millions in yield and significantly boosting Aave's TVL.\n\nEnabling lend and borrow support for wOETH on Aave will provide a new market for OETH holders and a new platform for leverage looping ETH. This new OETH market would lead to additional increased TVL for Aave, additional revenue to the Aave Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base due to OETH being higher yielding over the other Aave supported LSTs.\n\n#### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nThe Origin Protocol team is open to providing both token incentives and seed liquidity to jumpstart the wOETH market on Aave once wOETH is onboarded. More accurate amounts will be discussed with the Aave team and the ACI and can be shared during the ARFC stage of the proposal process.\n\n### 3.

        "author": "0xEd039871ec71FBDC3D714517cE97030Dd2E88622",
        "body": "**Author:** Peter from the Origin Protocol core team\n\n**Date:** 2024-09-20\n\n## 1. Simple Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding supply/borrow support for wsuperOETHb on the Aave v3 Base Instance\n\n## 2. Motivation/Background\n\nSuper OETH (superOETHb) is the next iteration of OETH, a superior LST with an extremely tight peg and high yields thanks to a combination of the OETH AMO and DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p. superOETHb yields are able to reach double digit levels, making it an exceptionally perfect token for lending and borrowing against ETH. superOETHb was built reusing 90% of the code from OETH, for which the codebase has already been audited 12+ times, and for which there is also an Aave Temp Check currently on the forum.\n\nSuper OETH is the first token in a new category of liquid staking: Supercharged LSTs. Supercharged LSTs will have materially higher yield while being designed for L2s, with a similar risk profile to mainnet LSTs. Ethereum liquid staking is amplified with chain-specific, auto-compounded incentives. Deep concentrated liquidity pools guarantee exits with minimal costs - users will never lose ability to convert back to ETH.\n\nWe've noticed many LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for projects who plan to integrate the LSTs, or for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This is not the case with OETH, and it will not be the case with Super OETH.\n\nUsing Super OETH on Aave will produce higher yield than the other top LSTs and have a near perfect ETH peg. Utilizing a concentrated Aerodrome liquidity pool with the tightest tick possible helps make Super OETH the most pegged L2 LST currently available, while being able to reach double digit yields. Our vision for Super OETH is for it to become the most trusted LST for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking.\n\nObtaining superOETHb is effortless, users can convert their ETH into Super OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on the Super OETH dapp 1\n- Swapping on WETH/superOETHb 1 - $178.8m TVL, $1.49m volume\n- Swapping on OGN/superOETHb - $12.3m TVL, $60.5k volume\n\nwsuperOETHb is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap superOETHb, you get back a fixed number of wsuperOETHb tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wsuperOETHb tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of superOETHb tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wsuperOETHb earns yield at the same rate as standard superOETHb. The wsuperOETHb to superOETHb exchange rate can be read from the contract (0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6, function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.\n\nCurrent exchange rate as of 9/20/24: 1 wsuperOETHb = 1.00945809 superOETHb\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nsuperOETHb and wsuperOETHb were built reusing 90% of the OETH code, which was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which many audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, OUSD reached a market cap of $300m without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. All OETH audits can be found in the audits section of the OETH docs. We have recently retained yAudit to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes. Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program is currently administered by Immunefi, where Origin maintains a median resolution time of 6 hours.\n\nThrough its integration with Aerodrome, Super OETH is able to ensure a 1:1 peg with ETH at any scale. The Super OETH AMO holds a portion of the protocol's underlying collateral in a concentrated liquidity pool with an extremely tight price range within a single tick above 1.0000 WETH. This allows anyone to sell superOETHb into the pool for at least 1 WETH (minus swap fees). The Aerodrome TWAP quoter, which works the same as the Uniswap TWAP oracle, can be used to derive the price of superOETHb on chain, and a superOETHb Tellor oracle is also in the works. superOETHb is also derived from OETH, which has mainnet oracles from Chainlink, Tellor, and Dia.\n\nChainlink has actually recommended protocols treat superOETHb to be 1:1 with ETH rather than use an oracle, as Aave has done with stETH. Both Morpho and Silo have done this with their wOETH markets. Super OETH likely qualifies for a Correlated-Asset Price Oracle (CAPO) based on similar LSTs that have qualified.\n\nBy design, superOETHb is the most pegged L2 LST:\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 3.34.44 PM](https://placeholder-image.com/superOETHb-peg-chart)\n\n### Performance\n\nSuper OETH has seen incredible growth since launch. Proof of Yield tracks the distribution of each Super OETH rebase event and displays the compounded yield on an annualized basis each day. The current Super OETH TVL sits at $182m with a native yield of 18.10% APY.\n\nSuper OETH has reached the number one spot by TVL on Defillama for yield projects on Base and accounts for a large amount of the Aerodrome Slipstream TVL.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-20 at 2.19.07 PM](https://placeholder-image.com/superOETH-tvl-chart)\n\nThere has been incredible demand for borrowing ETH against Super OETH for leverage looping on money markets. Utilization has been 100% the last week, any ETH added is almost immediately borrowed:\n\n- [Morpho](https://base.morpho.org/#/markets/0x7fc174e80f264448ebee8c88a7c4476aaf58ea6)\n- [Ionic](https://base.ionicprotocol.com/pool/0x1E8D76D7D841D7ef5E1A45911BDcFae96f7f4e6c)\n\nOrigin also has managed to integrate and onboard Super OETH into smaller projects, including:\n\n- [Spectra](https://app.spectra.finance/markets)\n- [Pooltogether](https://app.pooltogether.com/deposit)\n\n### Benefits of listing Super OETH\n\nSince 2021, Origin has streamed millions of dollars in stablecoin to Aave markets via OUSD strategies, generating millions in yield and significantly boosting Aave's TVL.\n\nEnabling lend and borrow support for wsuperOETHb on Aave will provide a new market for OETH holders and Super OETH holders, and add a new platform for leverage looping ETH. This new Super OETH market would lead to additional increased TVL for Aave's Base instance, which is currently the 8th largest instance, additional revenue to the Aave Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base due to Super OETH being significantly higher yielding over the other Aave supported LSTs.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nWhile no incentives have been used within any Super OETH integrations due to the high native yield of Super OETH, the Origin Protocol team is open to providing both token incentives and seed liquidity to jumpstart the Super OETH market on Aave once wsuperOETHb is onboarded. More accurate amounts will be discussed with the Aave team and the ACI and can be shared during the ARFC stage of the proposal process.\n\n## 3. Useful Links\n\nThis is Origin's fourth proposal, after proposing to add OGN as an Aave asset in 2021, proposing to add OUSD as an Aave asset in January 2023, and proposing to add OETH as an Aave asset in September 2024.\n\nAdditional relevant links:\n\n- [Origin Core Website](https://www.originprotocol.com/)\n- [Super OETH Website](https://www.superOETH.com/)\n- [dApp](https://app.superOETH.com/)\n- [Super OETH Analytics](https://analytics.superOETH.com/)\n- [Gitbook](https://docs.superOETH.com/)\n- [Github](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar)\n- [Super OETH Contract](https://basescan.org/address/0x00e22E90721920EC7144F4F23A90FA4d2D4090d1)\n- [wsuperOETHb Contract](https://basescan.org/address/0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6)\n- [Audits](https://docs.oeth.com/security/security-audits)\n- [Blog](https://blog.originprotocol.com/)\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/jyxpUSe)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OriginProtocol)\n- [Telegram]\n\n## 4.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard ggAVAX to Aave V3 on Avalanche \nDate: 2024-04-29\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe current proposal is set to add ggAVAX, a liquid staking AVAX token issued by the Gogopool protocol, to the AAVE V3 Avalanche market.\n\n### Motivation\n\nGoGoPool is one of the largest Avalanche DeFi protocols. It is ranked number 6 on the Avalanche C-Chain in terms of TVL chain and currently controls more than 500k AVAX (~$23M at current market prices).\n\nWe believe there is currently very large underserved demand for borrowing AVAX against ggAVAX, as ggAVAX is the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche. The APYs currently range between 7% and 8%, which is on the order of 33% more yield than any existing competitors on Avalanche. \n\nBeing the highest-yielding LST on Avalanche makes ggAVAX perfect for being a collateral asset, especially for those who seek leveraged exposure to native AVAX yields.\n\n \n![dd93fbd27bc1aac727035529eb5ff6253f57edc8.png](ipfs://bafkreibcfworgked4rc5maanvobvklqy6rmwchfk7rjyoswvyd2chpzsbu)\n    \n\n\nThis yield is achieved through a mix of no protocol fees, running validators instead of utilizing delegation mechanisms, and generating MEV yield from positive market interactions (see dashboard for more details: [Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK)). \n\nThere is currently more than ~80k AVAX in the ggAVAX-AVAX pools across Balancer and Wombat, making it the most liquid Avalanche LST relative to its size.\n\n \n![8867ec44b2d0dc326eaf4b928b7d7c889eb5f113.png](ipfs://bafkreig3f2xualvcqedjubvgg66tj3jwfkccocvm53l5dc5xtmmo6r5px4)\n    \n\n\nBesides the deep on-chain liquidity, ggAVAX allows users to redeem ggAVAX for underlying AVAX at an internal rate and with no fees. These redemptions are instant as long as there is enough AVAX in the ggAVAX smart contract to facilitate them.\n\nGoGoPool is backed by the Avalanche Foundation and industry-leading investors. In 2022, It raised $7.5M in two rounds [led by Framework Ventures and Coinfund and](https://www.theblock.co/post/166498/gogopool-raises-5-million-to-provide-decentralized-staking-on-avalanche?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) with participation from Silverstone Ventures, Fintech Collective, and Avalaunch. \n\nThe protocol has been [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/GoGoPool%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf) and [Kudelski Security](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62f90a8443126c2ee50f4c4e/643ee88bf91b375b39ba2613_Kudelski_multisig_labs_report_1.1.pdf) with an additional [Code4rena](https://docs.gogopool.com/audits/code4rena-audit) audit contest. It also has an ongoing [bug bounty program with Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/gogopool/).\n\n### Benefits of listing ggAVAX\n\nListing of ggAVAX on AAVE would create additional demand for borrowing AVAX (in E-Mode) and other assets. Since ggAVAX generates consistently higher yields than other LSTs, borrowers can tolerate higher interest payments, leading to AVAX utilisation and revenue for the DAO.\n\nCurrently, AVAX utilisation sits well below the Optimal Utilisation Rate. More than $30M in borrow demand is required to bring utilisation from 43% to 65%. Listing a new high-yielding LST as collateral will help create this additional borrowing demand, resulting in higher utilisation rates, higher APRs for AVAX lenders and higher income for the  AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. \n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nAave V3 on Avalanche.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nWith the recent implementation of [Price Cap Adapters (CAPO)](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=51), ggAVAX can be listed using an internal rate oracle without relying only on the AVAX/USD ChainLink price feed. This is the same approach that AAVE currently uses for sAVAX, wstETH, cbETH, weETH and other LSTs (and LRTs)\n\nggAVAX’s CAPO, however, might require a max growth ratio higher than the 10.1% currently set for sAVAX to account for a generally higher level of yield.\n\nWe welcome any questions about ggAVAX architecture and protocol structure and look forward to working on this with the DAO.\n\n### Specification\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap (ggAVAX)|70,000|\n|Borrow Cap (ggAVAX)|NA|\n|Debt Ceiling|NA|\n|LTV|30.00%|\n|LT|40.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|NA|\n|Variable Slope2|NA|\n|Uoptimal|NA|\n|Reserve Factor|NA|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowed in Isolation|No|\n|Emode|No|\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL)  and Deposit Commitments\n\nGoGoPool has earmarked 10k GGP tokens (worth +100K USD at average 90-day prices) for incentivising ggAVAX deposits into AAVE over the first three months of the listing to help bootstrap the market adoption and attract leverage takers.\n\nAfter the listing is complete, we plan to work tightly with Avalanche ecosystem partners to integrate the market into their products. This can include autocompounding vaults, composite strategies and auto-leverage vaults. \n\nThese and other integrations would help drive usage to the ggAVAX market specifically and AAVE in general. Note that we have already had preliminary talks with a number of protocols on this subject.\n\n### Useful Links\n\n[Website](https://www.gogopool.com/) \n\n[Github](https://github.com/multisig-labs/)\n\n[Flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/GoGoPool/ggp-protocol-stats-PitGzK) \n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/gogopool_)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gogopool.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Onboard RSR to Aave v3 \n\nAuthor: Reserve Protocol Core Team & ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-24\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\nThe Reserve Protocol Core Team proposes adding Reserve Rights (RSR) as an asset in AAVE V3 on Ethereum Mainnet. Reserve drives liquidity on AAVE lending markets through the underlying baskets of RToken collateral and demand for borrowing RSR will bring additional fees to AAVE. Reserve will also make available Curve ecosystem voting power to deepen GHO liquidity through a GHO-eUSD Curve pool.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nReserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming on-chain by users without the need for any middlemen. The Reserve Protocol launched on Ethereum mainnet in Oct 2022, Base in Oct 2023, and completed its fifth audit in Feb 2023.\n\nRSR is the governance token for Reserve Protocol and can be staked on a particular RToken, where it has two roles:\n\n1. RToken Overcollateralization: Staked RSR receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue in exchange for being the first capital-at-risk in the case of collateral default\n\n2. RToken Governance: Staked RSR proposes and votes on changes to the RToken’s configuration\n\nRSR contract has been live on ethereum for 1.5 years, has undergone audits by Solidified, and the dev team recently burned the multisig Pause Transfer functionality, making it immutable. RSR currently has a marketcap of $139m.\n\nThree of the RTokens already live on the protocol are High Yield USD (hyUSD) is a secure high yield savings dollar with up to 8% APY expected to outpace the rate of inflation in over 100 countries around the world. ETHPlus (ETH+) is a safety-first diversified ETH staking index with up to 4.5% APY. Electronic Dollar (eUSD) is a hyper-resilient stablecoin built to endure black swan events, recently proving itself during the run on Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n## Benefits of listing RSR:\n\nAn RSR lending market would fuel Reserve Protocol growth and TVL across Ethereum and Base networks. As the Reserve ecosystem expands, AAVE TVL grows because a portion of RToken collateral assets are held on AAVE lending markets for example, the largest RToken is currently eUSD ($17.7m TVL) which holds 50% of its collateral basket in USDC and USDT lending on AAVE.\n\nAdditionally, demand for RSR borrowing could create more fees for Aave.\n\nReserve Protocol is also open to providing seed liquidity for the asset.\n\n# Useful Links:\n\nProject: https://reserve.org/\nProtocol Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs\nRSR Documentation: Reserve Protocol Docs | RSR\nGithub/Source Code: Reserve · GitHub\nRSR Contract (Ethereum): Reserve Rights: RSR Token | Address 0x320623b8E4fF03373931769A31Fc52A4E78B5d70 | Etherscan\nRSR Oracle: Chainlink: RSR / USD Price Feed | Address 0x759bBC1be8F90eE6457C44abc7d443842a976d02 | Etherscan\nDune Dashboard: https://dune.com/reserve-protocol/reserve-protocol-overview\nBlog: https://blog.reserve.org/\nAudits: Reserve has been audited 5 times, RSR was audited by Solidified\nCommunities: Discord 3K, Twitter 111K, 104 GitHub stars\nRSR Price: CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap\n\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

CDCETH is an ERC-20 token issued on both Ethereum and the Cronos Chain that represents the underlying staked ETH on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\n### Motivation\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) was founded in 2016 with the vision of making cryptocurrency in every wallet. As of June 2024, [Crypto.com (http://crypto.com/) has more than 100 million users worldwide and is the industry leader in regulatory compliance, security, and privacy.\n\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) launched its on-chain staking product on its Main App and Exchange platform, with Ethereum as one of the most staked assets on the platform. \n\nTo enhance the liquidity and capital efficiency of staked ETH, [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) introduced a Liquid Staking Token (LST) - [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staked ETH (CDCETH) in November 2023 and reached $100M+ TVL (Defillama page here).\n\nCurrently, CDCETH’s on-chain liquidity on Ethereum is concentrated in the CDCETH/ETH pair on Curve (here) and Uniswap (here), with plans to launch a pool on Balancer next and incentivize to grow liquidity across these venues. \n\nOther liquidity venues can be found on the DeFi protocols on the Cronos chain and the order book on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Exchange platform, with support from multiple market makers. \n\nThe liquidity on the Cronos side can be bridged to Ethereum through the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform.\n\nIntegrating CDCETH as a collateral asset on Aave V3 serves a meaningful demand from CDCETH users on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) platform to utilize the LST as collateral to borrow on Aave. The platform aims to drive wide adoption of CDCETH on Aave V3 as collateral for borrowing by various promotional activities and integration with its product lines, such as social media posts when CDCETH is successfully onboarded.\n\nConfidential banners/listings on the [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) non-custodial wallet and banners within the Main App platform to direct CDCETH holders to use Aave via the non-custodial wallet.\nOnboarding CDCETH on Aave will create an entry point for a large number of CDCETH users and [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) users to make good use of the asset on Aave and also greatly improve CDCETH’s utility as a LST, resulting in a positive feedback loop for CDCETH & Aave adoption & increased revenues for both parties.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\n [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) is committed to providing initial supply-side liquidity of up to $5M CDCETH and liquidity mining programs of $100K in CDCETH over 3 months as a start.\n\nIntegration of CDCETH pool on Aave V3 with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)’s non-custodial wallet and Main App will be added to the pipeline once the pool is live, providing the gateway to over 100M global users on the platform.\n\n### Specification\n\nContract address: 0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e\nRate Provider contract for current exchange rate:\n0xfe18aE03741a5b84e39C295Ac9C856eD7991C38e (12. exchangeRate)\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Audits & Relevant links\n\nAudit: https://crypto.com/document/blocksec_securityaudit2024\n Issuer: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nWhitepaper: CDCETH\nDeFillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/crypto.com-staked-eth\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/crypto-com-staked-eth\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Staking page: https://crypto.com/staking\n[Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) Liquid Staking Q&A page: https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/8398277-liquid-staking\n\nCommunity:\nTwitter/X: https://twitter.com/cryptocom\nTelegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nNews on Telegram: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\nDiscord: [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) and did not receive compensation for the creation of this proposal.

The positive forum sentiment and vote timeline support outweigh the risks mentioned.\n- The recommendation mirrors aggregated forum sentiment favoring the proposal, aligning community opinion with the final decision.",
