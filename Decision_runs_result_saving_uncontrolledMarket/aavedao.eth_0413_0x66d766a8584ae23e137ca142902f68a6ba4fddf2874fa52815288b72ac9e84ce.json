However, in line with the [TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gho-liquidity-pools/13655), the DAO’s veBAL holding should be used to support the three primary pools.\n\nIn addition to Aave DAO’s veBAL holding, several veBAL & vlAURA holders have expressed an intention to help bootstrap GHO liquidity pools. We would like to give a special thank you to the Balancer and Aura community members for their contributions.\n\nThis proposal will try to estimate the gauge power allocated to GHO pools & the potential yield depending on several TVL estimations for each primary pool. In analyzing the potential liquidity conditions, three scenarios are presented.\n\n![|637x109](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/A5xYXlMR_mzanGEWrFjaSNbkao9Zykhi7yKDs2SIMrM_a-mfm9qfsVuX3cmllOazmUkJ-2ewKzf_OKcQ7KOk3UI3UKhiGNrM4L_bW50VDz8Zi9WByYPVVwDRUJU6hclu64kZ96cjz-jFzs2eZnQO7ss)\n\nWhile the initial GHO supply is expected to be 100M, additional cap increases can be implemented and voted so this can also help to visualize how the supported voting power can scale.\n\nFor the purpose of this proposal, it has been assumed that all relevant positions are continuously relocked to maximize the voting rights.\n\nAave DAO is contributing 1.81% of the ~ 7,7% veBAL and the remainder is coming from teams that TokenLogic has been coordinating with. Do note, there are dependencies on these contributors to maintain the voting support over time. Initial discussions indicate that in 2-3 months time, some veBAL and vlAURA holders are expected to revisit there allocations.\n\n## Estimated veBAL gauge power to bootstrap GHO at launch\n\nThe below table presents the initial veBAL and vlAURA expected to support GHO’s launch and Aave DAO’s veBAL holding. Aave DAO holds 157,169.86 B-80BAL-20WETH to be converted to an estimated 1.80% of veBAL supply by [Llama.](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-introducing-strategicassetmanager/13916) The table below shows the distribution of veBAL and vlAURA support for the main three GHO pools.\n\n![|660x69](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5lG1ZsmoHS7KZQGqh61NWikdaq6PbYDnsi2_VcZq1Il4nyF6GenO8_fDM7TACCqXWDDGZBPz5hLZrVYqpS7dgNDXcTQ96pG2MgnWISFhCTLYeAKR6ZNltmYDkr3Gep4BrImZHISaXaipuOoGuBeOEVo)Aave DAO with support from friends is expected to support GHO with 5.5% of veBAL later this week and 7.7% upon Aave DAO converting its B-80BAL-20WETH to veBAL. Subject to timing, some veBAL support from friends may taper when Aave DAO starts voting.\n\n## Estimations of BAL emissions & AURA rewards\n\nThe following estimations are based on vlAURA voting rounds & votes amount, but converted from the actual veBAL equivalent amount of support: 1 vlAURA = 0,1726 veBAL votes.\n\nWe propose Aave DAO split the veBAL voting weight as per below.\n\n* 40% used to vote on the GHO/bb-a-USD V3 pool\n* 40% used to vote on the GHO/LUSD pool\n* 20% used to vote on the 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool\n\nDo note, the voting weight can be changed periodically with each successive gauge vote.\n\n## 1) Aave DAO\n\nThe split proposed below is open for discussion in the comments section. However, later sections show the significance of Aave Friends voting support. We encourage the veBAL and vlAURA support to be view holistically and not just through the lens of Aave DAO’s holding.\n\n![|711x49](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Ya2Y1vJVK1Fg3d2gvoREbTGvfYZZQiUa0bhq4OJu0bqnkAyMJSAcXkteAlKQWotthRJAm_8FKZHoII_OMsn9KQmMAaF-v3oNHhB1-V4rhJUEUu3ub2JrRNLPfjjkrELLK6SyDF5r7URWAXSrnGpZi0U)\n\nRewards breakdown for the Aave DAO after the B-80BAL-20WETH is converted to veBAL holding:\n\n![|660x137](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/SG0AU1D4fWBjPK6FRSNQ8NVll-IvKk5ZwzTBs61iJYLa8WCbqhj7pABmiJFetg7yQn5x-r7PgqH03cC4UddgYSpskltJBOpS6Z5EYD2Y4NR1yp8qJLUiU2sAIcoAGS_FThOnXItmUtuam5htDH2kWpo)\n\nFor the three TVL scenarios being considered, the following APRs are estimated:\n\n![|660x97](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zi02UdPUDy1BYSeg_N8qZ0SNxkjTsj9zMgQKyP8dlPW5VwBYLv1beBtVeS1Ub1KGTpRorGrVEdp8tzU51YPWnVqDS7Fog_I7fUAdkbqy-pGyzS-dxRU-IO4_MQ0S96EeeEH1SpEErqNyKZDhi53PpEM)\n\nNaturally, TokenLogic will work with the Balancer community to redirect Balancer protocol fee funded vote incentives to preferential pools.

Once the above items are executed, the shortExecutor will implement the above gauge weight votes via the Strategic Asset Manager contract being deployed by Llama.\n\nAlternatively, a Treasury Committee can be created and assigned the AssetManager role enabling the votes to be implemented.\n\n# Future Considerations\n\nWhen presenting the analysis, there are several assumptions that affect the accuracy of the model over time. The most notable variables are mentioned below:\n\n* TVL in the pools\n* Duration of Aave Friends support\n* Frequency of re-locks (maximizing the veBAL voting rights)\n* Vote allocation\n* Aura Boost\n\nTo reduce this dependency on external parties, TokenLogic will publish three proposals in the near future:\n\n* Initiate Protocol Owned Liquidity (leading to increased strategic assets accumulation)\n* Create Treasury Committee\n* Initial GHO Liquidity Incentives Budget\n\n# Disclaimer\n\n@TokenLogic currently receives funding from the Butter Delegate Campaign and is a contributor @Llamaxyz.

Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Acquire AURA \nauthor: @TokenLogic & @MarcZeller (ACI)\ncreated: 2023-08-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes Aave DAO acquire 443,674 AURA from Olympus DAO for 420,159.28 units of DAI.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the next few months the veBAL and vlAURA being used to support GHO pools will reduce as voters shift there focus away from GHO. The initial commit from the Aura Finance team was 400,000 units of vlAURA for an initial 3 month duration.\n\nThis proposal seeks to replace the support from Aura Finance by acquiring 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO. Olympus DAO is reducing there AURA exposure due to change in the Olympus DAO roadmap which is detailed [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3756-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus) and [her](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3967-tap29-aura-solicitation-to-bid).\n\nBased upon the research presented in this [Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682), which details impact AIP-42 by Aura Finance, the most efficient way for Aave DAO to bootstrap GHO is via vlAURA relative to veBAL. \n\nOlympus DAO seeks payment in DAI, at an exchange rate of 0.9470 DAI per unit of AURA. The amount of AURA is 443,674 with a total cost to Aave DAO of 420,159.28 units of DAI. Aave DAO currently holds [2.873M](https://etherscan.io/token/0x028171bca77440897b824ca71d1c56cac55b68a3?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) units of aDAI on Aave v2.\n\n**Olympus DAO is conducting an open forum auction over 3 day period, bids are placed relative to the spot price derived from the AURA/wETH pool on Balancer v2.\n\nThe USD price will be updated within this proposal progressively over the bidding period. Do note, Aave DAO's governance process duration exceeds that of Olympus DAO's which means Aave DAO's voting occurs afterwards and ultimately determines if/when the OTC swap will occur**\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will achieve the following:\n\n* Redeem 420,159.28 units aDAI from Aave v2\n* Exchange 420,159.28 units of DAI for 443,674 units of AURA with Olympus DAO\n\nFor reference, Olympus DAO AURA Holding Address: `0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B`\n\nThe contract shall be developed in collaboration with @MarcZeller and deployed by the ACI team.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem. TokenLogic seeks to become an Aave DAO Service Provider.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Amend Safety Module AAVE Emissions\nAuthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative & @TokenLogic\nDate: 2023-09-24\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis publication proposes reducing AAVE (Safety Incentives) distributions to the Safety Module (SM) by 30% and introducing a 90-day SM emission cycle.\n\n## Motivation\nThe SM serves as the Aave Protocol’s self-protection smart contract. The Aave Protocol distributes 1,100 AAVE daily, split evenly across AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH deposits.\n\nFuture proposals shall discuss the composition and aim to improve the overall capital efficiency of the SM. However, this publication intends to reduce AAVE emissions in the immediate future, saving the DAO valuable AAVE emissions while the broader SM upgrade is being advanced. It is widely accepted within the community that Aave DAO is overpaying for AAVE and B-80BAL-20wETH deposits.\n\nThis publication proposes reducing AAVE emissions by ~30%. The revised AAVE emission is to be reduced from 1,100 AAVE/day to 770 AAVE/day. This represents a 330 AAVE/day reduction. The APR for stkAAVE holders is expected to reduce from 6.87% to 4.81%. Similarly, for the B-80BAL-20wETH deposits, yield is expected to fall from 14.35% to 10.05%.\n\nPlease note that the 80AAVE/20wETH Balancer v1 pool is to be migrated to Balancer v2 in the future. This will present the community with an opportunity to further revise the AAVE emissions. It may also occur at a time when the DAO has vlAURA and/or veBAL at its disposal.\n\nFor context, the Llama Part IV SM Upgrade suggests reducing the AAVE emission to stkAAVE holders by 75%. This is because slashing for stkAAVE is to be reduced, additional assets are to be added to the SM, and the emissions are to be redirected to those newly added assets. Since this proposal was published, stkAAVE has also gained the utility of discounted GHO borrowing rates.\n\nSimilarly, Xenophon Labs recommended doubling the slashing percentage from 30% to 60% on the stkAAVE pool and lowering emissions by 80 AAVE/day, from 550 to 470. While this publication does not propose amending the slashing rate, the reduction in AAVE emissions is about double.\n\n## Specification\nThe implementation for this proposal will be prepared by ACI. The table below shows the current and proposed daily AAVE Emissions.\n\n| Collateral           | Current Emissions | Proposed Emissions |\n|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| AAVE                 | 550               | 385                |\n| B-80AAVE-20wETH      | 550               | 385                |\n\nTransition to a 90-day period SM Emission schedule.\n\nA comparison between Xenophon Labs’ proposal and this proposal for stkAAVE holders is shown below:\n\n| TVL      | Slashing Rate | Protection | AAVE/day | AAVE Price | Annual Spend | Annual Cost per $ of Coverage | Deposit Yield |\n|----------|---------------|------------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| $175.0M | 30%           | 52.5M      | 550      | $60.00     | $12.045M     | $0.23                         | 6.88%         |\n| $175.0M | 60%           | 105.0M     | 470      | $60.00     | $10.293M     | $0.10                         | 5.88%         |\n| $175.0M | 30%           | 52.5M      | 385      | $60.00     | $8.431M      | $0.16                         | 4.82%         |\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclosure\nNeither ACI nor TokenLogic are compensated for the creation of this proposal by Aave Protocol.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The BB-A-USD token is to be deposited 50% directly into the Balancer gauge and 50% into Aura Finance's contract.\n\nAave DAO will earn BAL, AURA, swap fees and yield from Aave v3 via the linear pools. $3M is to be allocated to this strategy and the expected yield is around 9.3% without any boost from Aave's future veBAL holding.\n\nAave DAO will also gain the ability to create a BB-A-USD/GHO pool using BB-A-USD acquired by this proposal. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe current aethUSDC, aethDAI and aethUSDT holdings are shown below:\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.33.46.png](ipfs://bafkreifdz3sr45ieb77kmgsuzzir6ygvasygtstcd5rlyxipxd3gaz3v2u)\n The below shows the amount of DAI and USDT being migrated from Aave v2 to v3.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V2|USDT|3,119,535.51| $3,119,535.51 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V2|DAI|2,894,904.40| $2,894,904.40 |\n||||| $6,014,439.91 |\n\nThe table below shows the Aave v3 holdings after Part 2 of 3 has been implemented.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|3,155,411.89| $3,155,411.89 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|2,903,799.83| $2,903,799.83 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDC|58,173.59| $58,173.59 |\n|||||$6,117,385.31|\n\nAfter allocating $3.00M to BB-A-USD, Aave will have the following v3 holdings.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|1,655,411.89| $1,655,411.89 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|1,403,799.83| $1,403,799.83 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDC|58,173.59| $58,173.59 |\n|||||$3,117,385.31|\n\nThe aethUSDC is to remain deposited in Aave v3 and accumulate over time to facilitate any future Service Providers request for payment.\n\nAave also holds 4.5M of aUSDC on Aave v2 from Part 1 of 3 asset consolidation.\n\nWith the new [Aave v3 Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xfebb0bbf162e64fb9d0dfe186e517d84c395f016000000000000000000000502) created, gauge contract deployed and [Aura Finance integration](https://app.aura.finance/#/pool/81) complete, Aave DAO can now proceed attain the BB-A-USD and use it to earn yield. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-05-14 at 17.31.34.png](ipfs://bafkreicfefc3xsoel3sg64unqty4piq6pgzl44y6fza5i3544lh77tenvu)\n    \nAt the time of writing, routing a swap from stable coin to BB-A-USD incurs positive slippage. This is true for using all three stable coins. When setting the parameters for acquiring the BB-A-USD token, a maximum price impact of 0.20% will be used.\n\nThe methodology used for acquiring BB-A-USD will be the same approach used to acquire BB-80BAL-20WETH. \n\nIt has taken months to create a reusable approach that prevents MEV attacks and provides the ability to limit the price impact incurred when performing a swap. The methodology has been reviewed by Cowswap and Bored Ghost Developing.\n\nUpon receiving the BB-A-USD token, 50% is to be deposited into the Aura Finance contract and 50% is to be deposited directly into the Balancer gauge.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following asset holdings are to be redeemed and used for acquiring BB-A-USD.\n\n|Network|Instance|Token|Quantity| Value (USD) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethUSDT|1,500,000| $1,500,000 |\n|Ethereum|Aave V3|aethDAI|1,500,000| $1,500,000 |\n\nDetailed execution details will be provided in the comments prior to submitting the AIP. This will enable Llama and Bored Ghost Developing to optimise the execution methodology.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). \n\n    ",
