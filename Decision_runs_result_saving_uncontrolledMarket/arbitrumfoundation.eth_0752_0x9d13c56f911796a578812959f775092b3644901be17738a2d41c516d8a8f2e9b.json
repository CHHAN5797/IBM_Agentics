        "body": "TLDR;\n**The TMC recommends that the DAO votes for #3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy**\n\nThe four possible combined outcomes are:\n- **#1 Deploy Both Strategies**\n- **#2 Only Deploy ARB Strategy**\n- **#3 Only Deploy Stable Strategy**\n- **#4 Deploy Nothing**\n- **Abstain**\n\nIf no ARB is deployed (#4 Deploy Nothing, Abstain win), we will make the necessary modifications and resubmit the proposal for another vote. \n\nThe vote will be conducted via Ranked Choice Voting (RCV): Rank options; results use instant-runoff counting.\n\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe TMC has divided the partner selection into two groups: one for managing the stablecoin allocation—which covers converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and their ongoing management—and one for managing the ARB allocation for on-chain strategies. \n\nSpecifically, the plan is to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage those on-chain, while the remaining 10M ARB is deployed on on-chain ARB-only strategies.\n\nFurther information on the TMC mandate can be found here: [Tally | Arbitrum | Treasury Management V1.2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/111105159609719390908725919603971316574753860587890014819515615630412225940809?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4)\n\n# Shortlisted Proposals\n**Stablecoin Allocation (15M ARB Equivalent)**\n- Scope: This group covers the full process of converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and managing these assets for DAO liquidity needs.\n\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n- Gauntlet\n\n*Allocation Strategy:* The stablecoin management responsibilities will be evenly split among the three partners with a 33/33/33 distribution, ensuring diversification and balanced risk exposure while meeting the conversion and liquidity objectives.\n\n**ARB Allocation (10M ARB)**\n\n- Scope: This group is focused exclusively on deploying 10M ARB tokens into on-chain strategies designed to generate yield while safeguarding the principal.\n\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n\n*Allocation Strategy:* The on-chain ARB strategy will be managed equally by the two partners using a 50/50 split. Their proposals leverage proven DeFi protocols and ecosystem synergies to maximize risk-adjusted returns while maintaining liquidity and principal protection.\n\n\n# TMC Recommendation\nWe recommend a vote of **YES for the Stablecoin Allocation and NO for the ARB Allocation**.\n\nOur analysis shows that the stablecoin strategies presented by the selected partners meet our criteria for DAO alignment, returns, risk management, etc. \n\nWhereas the current ARB proposals lack sufficient risk management and clear operational details—resulting in low yield projections—we believe it is prudent to sit out on this allocation for now.\n\n\n# Voting Outcomes\nPlease cast your vote on each allocation separately. Your options are as follows:\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with converting 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage them via a 33/33/33 split among Karpatkey, Avantgarde & Myso, and Gauntlet.\n- **No:** Do not execute the stablecoin strategy; retain current ARB holdings without conversion.\n\n**ARB Strategy Allocation Vote:**\n- **Yes:** Proceed with deploying 10M ARB into on-chain strategies, managed in a 50/50 split between Karpatkey and Avantgarde & Myso.\n- **No:** Do not execute the on-chain strategy; hold the ARB tokens.\n\nThe four possible combined outcomes are:\n- **#1 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// YES deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n- **#2 NO, do not deploy the Stable Strategy /// YES, deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n- **#3 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy**\n- **#4 NO, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy**\n\n**We recommend that the DAO votes for #3 YES, deploy the Stable Strategy /// NO, do not deploy the ARB Strategy.**\n\nThe vote will be conducted via Ranked Choice Voting (RCV): Rank options; results use instant-runoff counting.\n\n*Note. The first vote corresponds to the Stablecoin Allocation and the second to the ARB Allocation.*\n\n---\n\n# Other Proposals\nDuring our review process, we evaluated several proposals that ultimately did not meet the criteria, required further clarity, or didn’t align with DAO objectives. \n\n- **AnthiasLabs x XBTO:** Their proposal did not provide adequate detail on stablecoin conversion, DAO alignment, or custody arrangements, which are critical to our objectives.\n\n- **August Digital:** While proposing a single-sided AMM strategy for both ARB yield and ARB-to-USD conversion, the proposal provided minimal details. There was no evidence of existing ARB strategies or a dedicated vault, and the timeline for necessary audits—if smart contracts are involved—was not addressed. Moreover, the risk management section appeared generic, with much of the content seemingly repurposed from other contexts.\n\n- **Bracket Labs:** The submission lacked clarity on key operational components, such as the choice of OTC counterparties or DEXes. Additionally, the rationale behind the 2% trading volume figure and the associated price impact considerations were not explained. Although a Stablecoin Vault is reportedly live, the lack of public transparency and reliance on historical yield figures from related funds (rather than the target vault) were significant concerns, compounded by high fee structures.\n\n- **WINR:** The implementation details were insufficient, leading to concerns over the alignment of risk and reward.\n\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit -- Further Clarification on Shortlisted Rationale\n\n**Stablecoin Strategies:**\nProviders like Karpatkey, Avantgarde/MYSO, and Gauntlet stood out due to their provided backtests, clear execution plans, compensation structure, and risk management frameworks.\n\nWe have high confidence in their ability to execute the conversion of 15M ARB into stablecoins with minimal slippage and market impact.\n\nAs well as deploy these assets in well-established, low-risk protocols—aligned with the intended use of funds. The shortlisted proposals target an average yield of 8% to 12% under varying market conditions while primarily holding USDC and USDT.\n\nThis is why we’re recommending a **YES** vote on the stablecoin allocation.\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit V2 \n**Below is a summary of the strategies, including fees and expected returns. Please refer to the tables for full details and note the associated risks outlined below.**\n\nNote that strategies might share the same general risks, and differences in returns may come down to how effectively the providers optimize yield under varying market conditions.\n\nThere are no guarantees or risk-sharing by the providers. As described below, fees are based on the allocation of assets to each provider and/or their performance.\n\nNote that for the Arbitrum Strategy, while both applicants use Myso they have wildly different reported return profiles (hence different risk profiles).\n\n---\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy**\n\n|Stablecoin Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Gauntlet | AAVE V3 | 8% | Free|\n|Karpatkey | Uniswap v3, Camelot v3, Balancer v2/v3, GMX, Aave v3, Compound v3, Fluid, Vertex (Perps), Pendle (Yield) | 12-20% | 0.5% management|\n|AvantGarde/MYSO | AAVE V3, Compound (core),  Pendle, Fluid, and Uni v3 (satellite) | 5-15% | 0.5% / 10% management/performance|\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Strategy**\n\n|Arbitrum Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Karpatkey | Myso | 7-20% | 0.5% mgnt|\n|Avantgarde/MYSO | Myso | 30%+ | 15% perf|\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Key Risks\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\n* **Stablecoin Risk:** The possibility of a stablecoin depegging.\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Exposure to potential hacks of the protocols used by each provider.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Funds may become locked if the lending rate reaches 100%.\n* **Optimization Risk:** The provider’s optimization might not perform as intended or may fail to beat the benchmark.\n* **Custody Risk:** Since the Foundation remains the custodian, custody risk is effectively transferred to the Foundation.\n\n### Arbitrum Strategy\n\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Inherent risk of the protocol being compromised.\n* **Asset Risk:** ARB could lose all value.\n* **Counterparty Risk:** If no counterparty is found, the strategy’s yield could drop to 0%.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Liquidity is locked for the duration of the call (30 days for monthly, 7 days for weekly).\n* **Covered Call Risks:**\n  * **Potential Conversion Risk:** If the strike price is reached, the ARB allocation may convert into stablecoins (see “Managing Potential Conversions”).\n  * **Premium Fluctuations:** Option premiums vary based on ARB’s volatility.\n  * **Secondary Market Risk:** If a covered call isn’t held to expiry, exposure to secondary market prices may result as the matched trading firm buys back the call.\n\n\n---\n\n**ARB Strategies:**\nWhen it comes to the ARB proposals, our review was less encouraging. Although there are some promising elements—for instance, Karpatkey and Avantgarde/MYSO show potential—the ARB strategies did not meet our strict criteria for transparency and risk mitigation. Our internal grading highlighted significant concerns:\n\n* **Lack of Transparency:** Key operational details—such as ARB option liquidity, allocation splits, and execution mechanisms—were either insufficiently detailed or not publicly verifiable, particularly for strategies involving off-chain fund movements.\n* **Inadequate Risk Management:** Given recent security breaches and governance failures across the industry, we believe that preserving the DAO’s capital is a priority. Without a clear risk framework, moving forward with these strategies would introduce unnecessary exposure.\n* **Trade-Offs vs. Returns:** The proposed strategies projected yields between 7% and 30%, depending on the strike price and maturity of options sold, and if the options are sold. If no counterparty is found the options strategy would yield a 0% return. Lending-based strategies offered minimal returns, around 0.16% per year which, even at our maximum allocation, would generate only $10,000–$12,000 annually at current prices. Given the scale of the allocation ($7.5M), these returns do not justify the associated risks.\n\nGiven these trade-offs, we believe the risk is not justified for an allocation of $7.5M worth of assets. Until proposals can deliver fully detailed strategies that meet our risk-adjusted return standards, it’s prudent to vote **NO** for the ARB allocation.\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Alignment Consideration:**\nA key criterion for evaluating submissions was alignment with Arbitrum. While most strategies will be executed on the Arbitrum network, not all will involve Arbitrum native protocols.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this but the main ones are the absence of proposals by Arbitrum native protocols and the fact that most liquidity on Arbitrum is on non-native protocols, making it difficult to allocate a large amount of stablecoin while retaining a competitive yield.\n\nGiven the dearth of sufficient proposals, our recommendation is to do nothing rather than something not justifiable from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n---\n# Edit 06.03.2025 V3\nFurther Clarification on the Shortlisted Rationale\n\n# TMC Clarification on ARB Strategy Decision\n\nHello everyone,\n\nFirst, we want to sincerely thank the teams at @avantgarde, @karpatkey, and Myso for taking the time to discuss their proposals in greater detail with us. We appreciate your proactive approach and the thoughtful contributions you have made, both privately and in the forum.\n\nBelow, we provide additional context on our recommendation to defer active deployment of the ARB allocation at this time, along with feedback on each proposal’s approach and risk management.\n\n# Overall Rationale for the “Hold ARB” Recommendation\n\n### Risk and Transparency\n\nWhile both teams have made significant efforts, the operational details for the ARB strategies, such as liquidity for options, counterparty arrangements, and daily/weekly execution, remain unclear. Given the large ARB allocation, this uncertainty makes us cautious.\n\n### Yield versus Complexity\n\nThe proposed yields for ARB strategies vary widely, ranging from near zero (for example, simple lending) to around 30% (for example, covered calls). However, the higher-yield strategies depend on liquidity or counterparties that may not be scalable, and the lower-yield approaches (for example, 0.16% on Aave) do not justify the additional complexity and risk.\n\n### Asset Manager Selection Considerations\n\nIt’s important to note that selecting an asset manager for alpha generation typically requires a multi-year to decade-long track record across multiple market regimes, a challenging standard, even in traditional finance. Therefore, if the core ARB strategy cannot stand on its own merits, claims of expertise should not serve as the primary selection criteria.\n\n### Prudent Governance\n\nOur mandate is to protect the DAO's treasury. Rather than forcing a strategy with an uncertain risk and reward profile, we prefer to hold ARB until more robust proposals/strategies emerge. This is a postponement rather than a permanent refusal, and we remain open to future improvements.\n\n# Feedback on Karpatkey’s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nWe appreciate Karpatkey’s detailed Risk Management Plan, which includes non-custodial architecture (Safe + Zodiac Roles Modifier), protocol whitelisting (Aave, Compound, Dolomite, Fluid, etc.), and clear maximum exposure thresholds (e.g., no more than 20–25% per protocol).\n\nThe yield estimates of ~8–12% for stablecoins appear realistic, and Karpatkey’s track record in managing other DAO treasuries (Gnosis, ENS, etc.) is well-documented.\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nKarpatkey proposes covered calls (via Myso) and deposit/borrow loops. While these ideas are valid in principle, the TMC remains concerned about the practical scalability of the options component (liquidity, strike selection, and counterparty discovery at large ARB notional sizes).\n\nThe lending-based approach offers minimal yield (~0.16% to ~4%), which does not justify the operational overhead or the added smart contract risk compared to simply holding ARB in a wallet. The covered-call approach is also sensitive to ARB price and carries risk in case of price appreciation as the cost of reimbursing the loan could exceed the value of the stablecoins used for farming. The backtest is based on a period of constant ARB price depreciation and therefore may not fully reflect this risk.\n\nAlthough Karpatkey mentions having advanced monitoring systems to respond promptly to adverse market conditions, we lack sufficient visibility into these tools to confidently recommend this approach to the DAO.\n\n# Feedback on Avantgarde’s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nThe Risk Management section shared by Avantgarde (and MYSO) highlights position-sizing constraints, lockup safeguards, and a diversified stablecoin approach. We especially appreciate the plan’s clarity on monitoring liquidity needs and the ability for the DAO to recall funds if necessary.\n\nExpected returns of 5–15% are in line with typical DeFi yields, and the approach includes established protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap.\n\n### ARB-Only Strategy\n\nSimilar to Karpatkey, Avantgarde’s ARB strategy also leans heavily on covered calls (via Myso) for yield generation. Although the theoretical upside is attractive, we lack sufficient real-world liquidity data for large ARB notional amounts. In addition to the conversion risk, the strategy presents a risk in case of a sharp ARB price increase (which again may not be accurately accounted for in backtests done over a period of relatively constant price depreciation). For instance, vaults on Ribbon and Premia also rely on selling covered calls and have recently incurred losses despite both vaults having widely different strategies, following sharp increases in the price of the underlying assets:\n\n![|279x242](upload://s9o3LomjufpoKGFCv2vNkXsIZ7e.png)![|278x242](upload://muAKCFJgbv5cgXo77WVyzhgL7CL.png)\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-ETH-C\n\nhttps://app.ribbon.finance/v2/theta-vault/T-WBTC-C\n\n![|624x237](upload://sZsXqwOlNY5GCyQH9FPHflXdoVZ.png)\n\nhttps://app.premia.blue/vaults/0xdc631d88dbb5eb39f5c4bf8b4e5298d098912fff\n\nWe value the team’s willingness to iterate on strike selection and maturity dates, but given current market conditions, we do not see a clear, low-risk path to consistent yields above simple “hold” alternatives.\n\n---\n\n# Reminder of Grading Criteria\nOur evaluation of proposals was based on the following key factors:\n- **25% – Experience & Track Record:** Demonstrated ability to manage treasury assets securely and effectively.\n- **25% – Risk Management:** Strength and clarity of risk mitigation measures under diverse market conditions.\n- **15% – Alignment with DAO Goals:** Consistency with the DAO’s growth objectives and ecosystem utility enhancement.\n- **15% – Expected Returns:** Realistic yield projections and sound risk-adjusted performance metrics.\n- **20% – Transparency & Reporting:** Commitment to regular, clear reporting and continuous performance monitoring.\n\n----\n\n# Timelines & Next Steps\n\nWe will move forward with a vote on Snapshot next Thursday, March 6, 2025.\n\n\n**Phase 1 – ARB Conversion & Stablecoin Management (15M ARB)**\n\n**IF Stable Strategy is Deployed*\n- Initiate a three‑month phase to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins.\n- Proceed with the deployment of low‑risk, yield‑bearing strategies for the converted stablecoins, with regular performance and risk reporting.\n\n**IF Stable Strategy is not Deployed:**\nRetain the current ARB holdings without conversion.\nNo further actions will be taken regarding stablecoin management until a new decision is reached.\n\n**Phase 2 – ARB On-Chain Strategy Deployment (10M ARB)**\n\n**IF ARB Strategy is Deployed:**\n- Deploy the 10M ARB into on-chain strategies.\n- Despite going against the TMC recommendation, we will commit to establishing a set of safe parameters for running the strategy.\n\n**IF ARB Strategy is not Deployed:**\n- Hold the ARB tokens without deploying them into on-chain strategies.\n- 3 months post Snapshot the RFP process will be held again.\n\n**Additional Next Steps for Both Allocations**\nThree months after the managers have been elected, publish a comprehensive report detailing the performance and management outcomes and re-evaluate the allocation strategy for potential adjustments.",

        "body": "TLDR;\n**The TMC recommends that the DAO votes for #Yes, Deploy Stablecoin Strategy**\nThe three possible combined outcomes are:\n- **YES, Deploy Stablecoin Strategy**\n- **NO, Deploy Nothing**\n- **Abstain**\nThe vote will be conducted via Single choice voting.\n\n\n**Key changes:**\n- The Arbitrum Foundation has expressed that they’ll be converting 15M ARB to Stablecoins per their internal policies.\n- In terms of the process to withdraw stablecoins to cover service provider shortfalls, we will define this process soon in a separate forum post and be holding an additional Snapshot vote to avoid forcing delegates to make a decision on both issues within the same vote.\n- No further changes have been made aside from splitting the vote into two separate Snapshots per the Community's request.\n---\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe TMC has divided the partner selection into two groups: one for managing the stablecoin allocation—which covers converting ARB tokens to stablecoins and their ongoing management—and one for managing the ARB allocation for on-chain strategies.\nSpecifically, the plan is to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage those on-chain, while the remaining 10M ARB is deployed on on-chain ARB-only strategies.\nFurther information on the TMC mandate can be found here: [Tally | Arbitrum | Treasury Management V1.2](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/111105159609719390908725919603971316574753860587890014819515615630412225940809?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4)\n\n---\n\n# Shortlisted Proposals\n\nStablecoin Conversion. The Arbitrum Foundation has expressed that they’ll be converting 15M ARB to Stablecoins per their internal policies.\n**Stablecoin Allocation (15M ARB Equivalent)**\n- Scope: This group covers the process of managing stablecoins.\nPartner Selection:\n- Karpatkey\n- Avantgarde & Myso\n- Gauntlet\n\n\nAllocation Strategy: The stablecoin management responsibilities will be evenly split among the three partners with a 33/33/33 distribution, ensuring diversification and balanced risk exposure while meeting the conversion and liquidity objectives.\n---\n\n# TMC Recommendation\nWe recommend a vote of YES to deploy the Stablecoin Strategy.\nOur analysis shows that the stablecoin strategies presented by the selected partners meet our criteria for DAO alignment, returns, risk management, etc.\n# Voting Outcomes\nPlease cast your vote on each allocation separately. Your options are as follows:\nStablecoin Strategy Allocation Vote:\n- Yes: Proceed with converting 15M ARB into stablecoins and manage them via a 33/33/33 split among Karpatkey, Avantgarde & Myso, and Gauntlet.\n- No: Do not execute the stablecoin strategy; retain current ARB holdings without conversion.\n\n---\n\n# Other Proposals\nDuring our review process, we evaluated several proposals that ultimately did not meet the criteria, required further clarity, or didn’t align with DAO objectives. \n\n- **AnthiasLabs x XBTO:** Their proposal did not provide adequate detail on stablecoin conversion, DAO alignment, or custody arrangements, which are critical to our objectives.\n\n- **August Digital:** While proposing a single-sided AMM strategy for both ARB yield and ARB-to-USD conversion, the proposal provided minimal details. There was no evidence of existing ARB strategies or a dedicated vault, and the timeline for necessary audits—if smart contracts are involved—was not addressed. Moreover, the risk management section appeared generic, with much of the content seemingly repurposed from other contexts.\n\n- **Bracket Labs:** The submission lacked clarity on key operational components, such as the choice of OTC counterparties or DEXes. Additionally, the rationale behind the 2% trading volume figure and the associated price impact considerations were not explained. Although a Stablecoin Vault is reportedly live, the lack of public transparency and reliance on historical yield figures from related funds (rather than the target vault) were significant concerns, compounded by high fee structures.\n\n- **WINR:** The implementation details were insufficient, leading to concerns over the alignment of risk and reward.\n\n---\n\n# 24.02.2024 Edit -- Further Clarification on Shortlisted Rationale\nStablecoin Strategies:\nProviders like Karpatkey, Avantgarde/MYSO, and Gauntlet stood out due to their provided backtests, clear execution plans, compensation structure, and risk management frameworks.\nWe have high confidence in their ability to manage and deploy 15M ARB worth of stablecoins in well-established, low-risk protocols—aligned with the intended use of funds. \nThe shortlisted proposals target an average yield of 8% to 12% under varying market conditions while primarily holding USDC and USDT.\nThis is why we’re recommending a YES vote on the stablecoin allocation.\n---\n\n**Stablecoin Strategy**\n\n|Stablecoin Strategy | Protocols Used | Exp. Returns | Fees|\n|--- | --- | --- | ---|\n|Gauntlet | AAVE V3 | 8% | Free|\n|Karpatkey | Uniswap v3, Camelot v3, Balancer v2/v3, GMX, Aave v3, Compound v3, Fluid, Vertex (Perps), Pendle (Yield) | 12-20% | 0.5% management|\n|AvantGarde/MYSO | AAVE V3, Compound (core),  Pendle, Fluid, and Uni v3 (satellite) | 5-15% | 0.5% / 10% management/performance|\n\n---\n\n\n## Key Risks\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\n* **Stablecoin Risk:** The possibility of a stablecoin depegging.\n* **Smart Contract Risk:** Exposure to potential hacks of the protocols used by each provider.\n* **Liquidity Risk:** Funds may become locked if the lending rate reaches 100%.\n* **Optimization Risk:** The provider’s optimization might not perform as intended or may fail to beat the benchmark.\n* **Custody Risk:** Since the Foundation remains the custodian, custody risk is effectively transferred to the Foundation.\n\n---\n\n**Arbitrum Alignment Consideration:**\nA key criterion for evaluating submissions was alignment with Arbitrum. While most strategies will be executed on the Arbitrum network, not all will involve Arbitrum native protocols.\n\nThere are multiple reasons for this but the main ones are the absence of proposals by Arbitrum native protocols and the fact that most liquidity on Arbitrum is on non-native protocols, making it difficult to allocate a large amount of stablecoin while retaining a competitive yield.\n\nGiven the dearth of sufficient proposals, our recommendation is to do nothing rather than something not justifiable from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n---\n\n\n# Edit 06.03.2025 V3\nFurther Clarification on the Shortlisted Rationale\n\n\n# Feedback on Karpatkey’s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nWe appreciate Karpatkey’s detailed Risk Management Plan, which includes non-custodial architecture (Safe + Zodiac Roles Modifier), protocol whitelisting (Aave, Compound, Dolomite, Fluid, etc.), and clear maximum exposure thresholds (e.g., no more than 20–25% per protocol).\n\nThe yield estimates of ~8–12% for stablecoins appear realistic, and Karpatkey’s track record in managing other DAO treasuries (Gnosis, ENS, etc.) is well-documented.\n\n# Feedback on Avantgarde’s Proposal\n\n### Stablecoin Strategy\n\nThe Risk Management section shared by Avantgarde (and MYSO) highlights position-sizing constraints, lockup safeguards, and a diversified stablecoin approach. We especially appreciate the plan’s clarity on monitoring liquidity needs and the ability for the DAO to recall funds if necessary.\n\nExpected returns of 5–15% are in line with typical DeFi yields, and the approach includes established protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Uniswap.\n\n---\n\n# Reminder of Grading Criteria\nOur evaluation of proposals was based on the following key factors:\n- **25% – Experience & Track Record:** Demonstrated ability to manage treasury assets securely and effectively.\n- **25% – Risk Management:** Strength and clarity of risk mitigation measures under diverse market conditions.\n- **15% – Alignment with DAO Goals:** Consistency with the DAO’s growth objectives and ecosystem utility enhancement.\n- **15% – Expected Returns:** Realistic yield projections and sound risk-adjusted performance metrics.\n- **20% – Transparency & Reporting:** Commitment to regular, clear reporting and continuous performance monitoring.\n\n----\n\n# Timelines & Next Steps\n\nWe will move forward with a vote on Snapshot next Thursday, March 27, 2025.\n\n\n**ARB Conversion & Stablecoin Management (15M ARB)**\n\n**IF YES, the Stablecoin strategy is deployed:**\n- Initiate a three‑month phase to convert 15M ARB into stablecoins via the Foundation.\n- Proceed with the deployment of low‑risk, yield‑bearing strategies for the converted stablecoins, with regular performance and risk reporting.\n\n**IF NO, the Stablecoin strategy is not deployed:**\n- Retain the current ARB holdings without conversion.\n- No further actions will be taken regarding stablecoin management until a new decision is reached.\n\n\n**Additional Next Steps for Both Allocations**\nThree months after the managers have been elected, publish a comprehensive report detailing the performance and management outcomes and re-evaluate the allocation strategy for potential adjustments.",

        "body": "# TL;DR\nThe GMC's preferred choices for the deployment of 7,500 Arbitrum DAO treasury ETH are stated below. The selected protocols include Camelot, Aave, Lido, and Fluid. If this vote receives 3% of the votable token supply in favor (or abstain) of deploying assets in accordance to the GMC's choices, the Arbitrum Foundation will begin to mobilize. \n\n# Summary [Updated on March 14, 2025]\nOn December 21 2024, the Arbitrum DAO voted in favour of establishing two committees - the Treasury Management Committee (TMC) and the Growth Management Committee (GMC), who were tasked with spearheading treasury management efforts involving 25M ARB and 7,500 ETH, respectively, within the ArbitrumDAO’s treasury.\n\nThis proposal presents GMC’s preferred allocation choices with accompanying risk assessments performed by LlamaRisk. After assessing all 45 applications, the GMC is proposing to allocate 5,000 ETH to Lido to be staked for wstETH, and deposit this 5,000 wstETH into Aave V3 on Arbitrum to act as liquidity for LST/LRT looping, and lastly, lend 2,500 ETH on Fluid to support ETH based DEX and lending liquidity.\n\n# Objectives\nAs highlighted in the original Treasury Management V1.2 proposal, the purpose of the Growth Management Committee (GMC) was to provide a path for the Arbitrum Foundation to deploy 7,500 ETH from the DAO’s treasury to achieve 2 things:\n\nGenerate low-risk yield on otherwise idle ETH\nSpur ecosystem growth\nMoreover, given this is the DAO’s first tranche of funds, we really wanted to ensure the DAO starts with a really strong and stable foundation, while securing key partnerships from the very beginning. Thus, we focused on selecting extremely high quality partners with low risk strategies that allowed the DAO’s funds to maximize its reach and impact within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n# GMC’s Preferred Allocations\nTotal Allocation: 7,500 ETH\n\nNumber of Allocations: 4\n\n# Allocation 1:\n\nProtocol: Lido\n\nAllocation Amount: 5,000 ETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Deposit and stake 5,000 ETH with Lido to receive wstETH\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n3.20% ETH/stETH yield (30D Avg.)\nHighly liquid & composable receipt token that can be extended across other applications (wstETH)\n20% “Reward Share” from Lido’s Reward-Share Program, effectively giving the DAO a higher yield on our ETH deposits into Lido\n# Allocation 2:\n\nProtocol: Aave\n\nAllocation Amount: 4,200 stETH (in wstETH) [Previously 5,000 ETH]\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Supply 4,200 stETH (in wstETH) to Aave V3 on Arbitrum to encourage LRT borrowing against wstETH in collaboration with Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n3.20% ETH/stETH yield (30D Avg.) + est. Aave wstETH supply yield of 0.62% + 0.82% in wstETH deposit incentives\nAdditional incentive programs from Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp, to drive wstETH, ezETH, and rsETH deposits to Aave V3 and more generally Arbitrum. This should also hopefully increase supply rates for wstETH on Aave\nAllows the DAO to repurpose funds from Allocation 1 (wstETH) to further improve the DeFi ecosystem while accessing a higher yield\nFurther Details Regarding Incentives:\n\nIn cooperation with Lido, an incentive program to grow wstETH deposits on the Aave Arbitrum instance has been designed.\n\nThe incentive program consists of three 30-day phases, each with increasing targets and budgets to encourage sustained growth in wstETH deposits on Aave. After 90 days this program will be reassessed and may be renewed. For each phase, the reward mechanism operates in two modes:\n\nWhen deposits are below the target: Depositors earn a fixed 0.82% APY.\nWhen deposits exceed the target: The daily reward amount is distributed pro-rata among all depositors.\nThe program features a 15% Month-over-Month growth target with an expanding budget to support continued growth in wstETH deposits on the Arbitrum Aave instance.\n\nPeriod (Days)\tBudget (wstETH)\tFixed APY\tDeposit Target\tDaily Reward\n0-30\t36.23\t0.82%\t53,014.48\t1.191\n31-60\t41.66\t0.82%\t60,956.66\t1.389\n61-90\t47.91\t0.82%\t70,111.66\t1.597\nRenzo\n\nRenzo is to provide 0.30% yield in REZ to users who deposit ezETH distributed every 30 days , provided certain conditions are upheld.\n\nKelp\n\nKelp is to provide x2 KERNEL points to users who deposit rsETH. These rewards will be claimable during Kernel’s TGE. Whilst the point yield is speculative, it does provide an alternative to Renzo’s governance token derived yield.\n\nIncentives\n\nThis strategy benefits directly from the Lido wstETH deposit incentives, and will indirectly benefit from the Renzo and Kelp deposit incentives.\n\nReward Type\tValue\tRewards to who\tBenefits treasury funds?\nwstETH Deposit Rewards\t0.82% APY\twstETH depositors\tDirectly\nKERNEL Points\tx2 Points\trsETH depositors\tIndirectly\nREZ Tokens\t0.3% APY\tezETH despositors\tIndirectly\nExpected Returns\n\nBased upon our modelling of the effects of the upcoming incentive programs and some minor Aave parameter adjustments which are planned, we expect wstETH deposits to generate the following returns:\n\nSource\tYield (APY)\nLido staking rewards\t3.10%\nAave protocol yield\t0.62%\nwstETH deposit incentives\t0.82%\nTotal yield\t4.54%\n# Allocation 3:\n\nProtocol: Fluid\n\nAllocation Amount: 2,500 ETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Lend 2,500 ETH on Fluid’s Arbitrum platform\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\n1%-2% native ETH yield\nSupport the growth of Fluid’s highly capital efficient DEX and lending protocol by providing ‘sticky’ ETH liquidity for users to borrow\nDue to Fluid’s design, every $1 of ETH we lend, the Arbitrum ecosystem can benefit from up to $39 in liquidity\nProvide necessary liquidity to increase caps and onboard more LSTs and LRTs to Fluid’s Arbitrum instance\n# [Added as of March 14, 2025] Allocation 4:\n\nProtocol: Camelot - Updated submission can be found here\n\nAllocation Amount: 800 stETH\n\nBasic Strategy Description: Deposit 800 stETH (as wstETH) as single sided liquidity into the wstETH/ETH liquidity pool on Camelot V3.\n\nExpected Benefit(s):\n\nEarn 2.56% APY from wstETH yield, trading fees, & xGRAIL (30D Avg.)\nAllows the DAO to repurpose funds from Allocation 1 (wstETH) to further improve sticky DeFi liquidity\nA risk Assessment (LlamaRisk) finds that risks include liquidity concentration risk and smart contract risk.\n\nNote: The decision to provide single-sided wstETH liquidity came from discussions with and detailed analysis by the Camelot team, as they are aware of the difficulties associated with the DAO and the Arbitrum Foundation actively managing a concentrated LP position. Nonetheless, the strategy still successfully improves wstETH liquidity on Camelot and the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\n# Justification\nThe GMC was impressed by the quality of inbound applications from protocols across many different verticals (full list can be in a subsequent section of this post). While the GMC wanted to venture further down the risk curve in order to increase yield, help bootstrap up and coming protocols, bolster Arbitrum native/aligned protocols, among other desires, it determined that a strong/conservative foundation for the DAO’s treasury strategy made the most sense until the DAO becomes more capable of actively managing positions.\n\nFor example, many proposals included LRT-based strategies. While the GMC did want to encourage the growth of LRTs, we did not think the direct exposure to LRTs was appropriate for the first tranche of fund deployments. Instead, we chose a sector that indirectly benefits LRTs by deepening wstETH liquidity to enable LRT looping strategies. In a different example to help explain the rationale behind our preferred choices, many applications included vote-locked/escrowed tokens as a portion of the yield, but it’s difficult to envision how these reward tokens would be managed in practice. A large number of applicants requested the DAO take on leveraged positions, which would require active management to manage liquidation risk. We also received applications from centralized entities, but felt the allocation would be most beneficial for the Arbitrum ecosystem if given to protocol applications that indirectly benefit a variety of other protocols on Arbitrum.\n\nLido, Aave, and Fluid represent safe applications that achieve conservative yield and strongly support ecosystem growth. Lido has offered a strong concession in its 20% reward share to the DAO, and has proven to be an essential protocol across a number of DeFi ecosystems. Many protocols on Arbitrum would benefit from a larger supply of wstETH on the network, and by partnering with Lido, we are able to achieve this and form a long-term relationship with a protocol that has made critical contributions to the Ethereum ecosystem. Aave falls in this camp as well, it is a well-established and battle-tested player that is easy to form a treasury management strategy around, and it has exemplified product market fit across a wide variety of DeFi ecosystems. In terms of Fluid, it is one of the fastest growing DeFi protocols, with its marketshare continually trending upwards on Ethereum mainnet thanks to its capital efficient design. Fluid is already seeing strong growth on Arbitrum One, has committed to incentivizing its Arbitrum One deployment, and the GMC believes that this growth can be fueled forward by including them in the DAO’s treasury management program. Fluid’s highest-in-class LTVs will result in maximum ecosystem value add for those users wishing to take advantage of these unique opportunities too.\n\nWe want to remind all applicants that this is hopefully the first round of many future allocations. The desire is to continually reinvest ETH and stablecoin revenue into the Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem to increase DAO sustainability as well as supporting Arbitrum’s ecosystem of builders. If you were not selected this round, you will be considered in future allocations assuming the DAO supports it.\n\n# Risk Assessment (Llama Risk)\nLlamaRisk has reviewed these different strategies and finds the risk inherent to each is satisfactorily mitigated to warrant the allocation. In summary, LlamaRisk have identified the following key asset risks and strategy risks:\n\nIncremental wstETH asset risks include:\n\nLiquidity for the asset is low on Arbitrum, meaning the ETH allocation will have to be staked on mainnet then bridged over using Arbitrum’s canonical bridge.\nIncremental Aave wstETH strategy risks include:\n\nArbitrum DAO may not be able to withdraw its entire position at all times due to volatility reducing market liquidity. This risk is managed by Aave’s interest rate model, with successful effects demonstrated with the level of withdrawal liquidity of Aave V3’s Arbitrum wstETH market being over 40,000 on February 4th.\nThe yield may be lower than anticipated as liquid restaking yield is lower than was expected 6 months ago, meaning limited profit for traders leveraged longing liquid restaking tokens and shorting liquid staking tokens. This is the primary use case for those looking to short wstETH, which is demonstrated by low deposit rates for wstETH on this market.\nFluid strategy risks include:\n\nFluid DAO change management processes (e.g. LTV modifications) are not clearly structured and outlined. This could lead to changes to market critical settings going into effect without all participants knowing, which may have unintended consequences.\nA high degree of trust is placed in the core team, with access controls resting in their hands over important functions such as freezing the protocol, users and market modifications. A 7/13 multisig controls these functions, which is owned by the core team. Given that many of these signers are based in India, some degree of operational risk is introduced from frequently arbitrary regulatory rulings in this jurisdiction potentially preventing their continued compliance with the protocol’s best interest. Uncertainty remains, introducing risk.\nAs with Aave, pool liquidity risk may prevent the DAO’s entire position being withdrawn in a single transaction during periods of high volatility. Also as with Aave, Fluid competently restores market liquidity quickly through its interest rate model.\nFull risk analyses, with guiding processes, are available:\n\nwstETH asset + Aave Strategy Risk Analysis\nETH asset + Fluid Risk Analysis\n# Next Steps\nIf approved by the DAO, which per the original proposal that passed on Tally requires a Snapshot vote with a simple majority of votes signaling For/Abstain with the quorum equal to 3% of the votable token supply at the time of the proposal going live, the Arbitrum Foundation can begin deploying the 7,500 ETH in accordance with the processes defined in the original applications. This proposal will move to Snapshot on Thursday, March 20, 2025.\n\nIf the DAO rejects the choice of the GMC, it will take into account the feedback from the community and alter its choices and proceed to another forum post/Snapshot vote over the coming weeks.\n\n# Full list of applications\nThe entire list of submitted applications can be found here.

        "body": "## TLDR FOR SNAPSHOT VOTING\n* Previosuly known as Questbook grant program, we are seeking renewal for a third season\n* This third iteration will last 1 year\n* The vote is about renewing the program with the 4 historical domain (New protocols and ideas, Dev Tooling, Gaming, Education+Events) or adding a 5th domain (Orbit)\n* Funding will be $1,500,000 for each of the 4 domains for a total of $6,000,000 excluding opex, plus eventually further $750,000 for the Orbit domain (half budget due to being experimental)\n* JoJo will be the PM, Questbook will be the technological partner, and we will have elections for the 4 domain allocator; for Orbit, if passed, we want to appoint [MaxLomu](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/maxlomu/summary) as domain allocator due to his vision and expertise\n* Assuming this snapshot passes, we will then have a candidacy window period, elections after the Christmas break of the DAO, and then Tally vote toward end of January\n\n## Abstract\nThe Arbitrum Domain Allocator Offerings Grant Program (D.A.O.) has operated for one year across two six-month seasons. The program has evolved and improved based on previous results, growing from its first season, which allocated $250,000 across four domains, to a second season with funding of $1,000,000 per domain.\n\nWe are now proposing a third season that would run for a full year, encompassing the existing four domains (Protocols, Education/Community and Events, Dev Tooling, and Gaming) while potentially adding a fifth domain (Orbit). The vision is to create a modular program where new domains can be integrated over time based on DAO requirements and perceived needs. This new season will also improve tracking of grantee progress after funding and facilitate fast-tracking of exceptional projects into other DAO initiatives, such as Arbitrum Foundation programs and the GCP.\n\nQuestbook will serve as the technical partner of the program, offering their services through the Questbook.app portal.\n\n\n## Season 1 and 2 recap\nSeason 1 of the Grant Program was initiated through an RFC in [April 2023](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081?u=jojo), designed to serve four distinct domains: New Protocols and Ideas, Dev Tooling, Education/Community/Events, and Gaming. Following a successful [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xe07fb357b2b40e042ca58a36a1534afc33a1d313d4781ac433536bc884fc3c65) and [tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/52789605232046584393223454610845077119190920888046802640362214067679574612119?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) vote along with elections for the four DAs, the program officially launched in October 2023. The team consisted of [JoJo](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/jojo/summary), [SEEDGov](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/seedgov/summary), [Flook](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/flook/summary), and [Juandi](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/juandi/summary) as Domain Allocators, with [Srijith](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/srijith-questbook/summary) serving as Program Manager.\n\nThe first season operated for six months with a budget of $250,000 per domain, totaling $1 million in funding, and implemented a soft cap of $25,000 per project. In April 2024, the program was [renewed](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum/proposal/98446466630612736687159241204141593794174501692677162686607521796118942563659?govId=eip155:42161:0x789fC99093B09aD01C34DC7251D0C89ce743e5a4) for Season 2 with the same team but expanded funding to $1,000,000 per domain. The soft cap was increased to $50,000, with proposals exceeding $25,000 requiring evaluation from two Domain Allocators.\n\nSeason 2 has now completed its fund allocation phase and will continue operating at reduced capacity for the next six months to oversee milestone completion and grant disbursement. Bear in mind that Season 2 results are partial from the first 6 months, and it will have its natural end in May 2025.\n\nThe following are the numbers so far achieved:\n\n* **Season 1**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 67\n    * Amount of completed projects: 49 / 73%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 8 / 12%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 6 / 9%\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 4 / 6%\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 207\n    * Amount of completed milestones 178 / 86%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 23 / 11%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $997,793\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $852,781 / 86%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $87,512 / 8.5%\n\n*Note: Uncompleted projects are those currently active but were either unable to complete their proposals within the last six months or pivoted to a different idea. Abandoned projects are from teams that weren't able to operate in the market. Withdrawn projects are those that were approved but decided not to proceed with their grant.*\n*While there was no specific timeline set, we feel Season 1 has come to its natural end, and we are in the process of informing teams and withdrawing remaining funds.*\n\n* **Season 2**\n  * Amount of projects approved: 127\n    * Amount of completed projects: 42 / 33%\n    * Amount of uncompleted projects: 85 / 67%\n    * Amount of abandoned projects: 0\n    * Amount of withdrawn projects: 0\n  * Amount of milestones approved: 451\n    * Amount of completed milestones 240 / 53%\n    * Amount of uncompleted milestones 211 / 47%\n  * Amount of funds approved: $2,602,247\n    * Amount of fund disbursed: $1,356,181 / 44%\n    * Amount of funds leftover: $1,246,066 / 41%\n\nMore details on the results can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ts3oUeRy5cMp-5ksyld570VhmdjdUEVvtt2VhUYxfc4/edit?gid=1462691949#gid=1462691949).\n\n\n\n## Season 3: overview\n\nIn the last year, and potentially for the next year, the D.A.O. Grant Program has brought and will continue to bring the following value to the DAO:\n\n1. Introductory Grant Program: It fills the gap of Arbitrum Foundation grants (usually starting at $50,000, up to $150,000), serving as an entry-level program in our ecosystem.\n2. Transparency: All applications and judgments are available for everyone to read in the portal. Additionally, discussions with protocols are typically maintained in a public Discord with open access.\n3. Targeted Approach: The program has specialized in four specific verticals deemed key by the DAO\n4. High submission amount: between Season 1 and 2 we managed more than 700 proposals, approving around 200.\n\nWhile these points have always been advocated and envisioned as the natural shape of the program, below is a non-comprehensive list of value propositions that has been provided so far through in the last two seasons of the program:\n\n* Enable new teams and small builders to bootstrap their projects\n* Enable mid and big team to prioritize certain deployment in Arbitrum\n* Support Hackathon and Event winners\n* Provide an alternative funding route alongside the Arbitrum Foundation or direct DAO proposals\n* Support projects building upon targeted DAO initiatives\n* Ensure builder diversity, enlarging indirectly Arbitrum mindshare for local builders.\n\nA few specific examples of what we think can be defined as success stories:\n\n* Season 2 has supported both the [winner](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66eda59a8868f5130a656e1f&isRenderingProposalBody=true) and [runner-up](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f30eb1c1eb9145098a15e&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66bbd4ee8868f5130a6ffe57&isRenderingProposalBody=true) of Arbitrum GovHack at EthCC\n* Curia's [Governance Dashboard](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66bdceb58868f5130a8cd78d&isRenderingProposalBody=true), initially [rejected](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x573c74706924ce482080ba44deb77d75e8d6bdb516fbbdee54b78861c1683f1b) by the DAO, has been later approved through the grant program with a 20% cost reduction\n* Pear Protocol, currently trading at $7.5M market cap with a $160M cumulative volume in 60 days in the perp space, received a grant to develop their [API module](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x538&isRenderingProposalBody=true) for market makers\n* Mountain protocol, rwa protocol having around $10M in liquidity in Arbitrum, has [bootstrapped its activity in Arbitrum through a grant ](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x4494cf7375aa61c9a483259737c14b3dba6c04e6&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x4ee&isRenderingProposalBody=true)in Season 1\n* Vyper, a language with an extreme mindshare in the Ethereum community, has seen [support to their compiler in Season 2](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f32a15488d5000f0562b3&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66a4e20af2fef64647207b3d&isRenderingProposalBody=true), which will help securing hundreds of millions in DeFi applications\n* Applications like FairAI's are building on top of initiatives such as LTIPP and STIP.b to improve the [discoverability of projects with incentives](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=663ec3d47d71679fa9a3852c&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n\nIn this new iteration, the DA program will last one year. After two six-month seasons with subsequent renewals, there is sufficient maturity in both the program and the DAO to extend it, reducing the burden on delegates for operational renewal and addressing issues such as gaps between seasons.\n\nFunding will be proportional to Season 2, which effectively allocated $750,000 for each of the four domains for six months: for a one-year program, **the funding for the four domains will be $1,500,000 per domain, for a total of $6,000,000 for the four domains excluding OpEx**. Additionally, after discussions with several delegates and the Foundation, and assessment of the current DAO landscape and working groups, there is interest in a potential fifth domain related to Orbit chains. Acknowledging its experimental nature, the proposal suggests funding this domain with half the amount of other domains: $750,000 for one year.\n\nThe grant structure will remain unchanged. Grantees can request up to $25,000 with a single DA review, and up to $50,000 with two DA reviews. Grants will be paid on a milestone basis, where projects must first complete the milestone, verify it with the DA, and then receive the corresponding portion of the grant. Only in exceptional cases, such as when milestone funds are essential for completion or in situations of economic distress, may the DA, at their discretion, release milestone funds in advance.\n\nUpon completing KYC/KYB, grantees will have up to six months to complete their proposal. If they fail to do so, remaining funds will be retained by the program and either reassigned to new projects or, if the program has naturally concluded, returned to the DAO.\n\nUpon proposal completion, grantees must publish a final report in the Arbitrum forum to inform the general DAO community about their project.\n\nThree months after proposal completion, grantees must complete a survey and publish an update to their final report, aimed at tracking their success, foothold gained in Arbitrum, and adherence to or pivot from their original idea.\n\nBefore completion, a subset of projects will be internally selected by the PM and DAs for fast-tracking through a PM pitch into other ecosystem programs, such as the Arbitrum Foundation Grant Program or the GCP. While this won't necessarily guarantee further grants from these or other entities, it will ensure exceptional protocols can continue their journey and expand within the ecosystem.\n\nWith these modifications, several gaps from previous seasons are addressed:\n\n1. Creating a checkpoint for approved proposals after their final milestone: This will enable better overall tracking of project outcomes.\n2. Integrating exceptional projects into DAO growth programs to establish a clear pathway for continued development within the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## Program phases\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibao77we73buy5735xsaeudsadh2j23rpkmclftijsgnwfgin2ndu)\n\nExcluding the initial phases of snapshot discussion, temp check on the proposal, candidacy for DAs, elections for DAs, and on-chain vote, the program is articulated in the following phases:\n1. A first 1 year phase: during these 12 months, funds allocated to the program will be assigned to DAs to the projects that will be evaluated as worth financing. During this phase, the green one in the graph, all the team will operate at full capacity.\n2. A second phase, at low capacity, lasting 6 months: this phase is also effectively already embedded in phase 1. During this 6 months we will assume that there won't be any new fund to distribute from the main phase, and it will be a monitoring one. As stated, grantees, once approved and kyced, will have *up to* 6 months to complete their project. This means that projects approved, for example, in the last legal month of phase 1, will be able to complete their path up to 6 months after the end of phase 1. In this period, the team will work at low capacity, with a 20% cost.\n3. A third phase, potentially extending up to 3 months after the end of phase 2, related to the checkmark of projects after completion. If we consider a project that gets approved in the last month of phase 1, and needs 6 months to arrive to completion (so is completed in the last month of phase 2), we will necessarily have to place the checkmark 9 months after the legal completion of phase 1. Note: there is no opex coverage for this phase, since is effectively based on contacting projects, interviewing them likely with a google form and report in the forum, but only as said for projects that were approved in the last quarter of phase 1 AND that requires 6 months for completion (which is not always the case). This phase will be covered through the team which will have the goodwill of finishing to accompany projects in their path, and could potentially be resolved through the passing of the baton to a new team, or confirmation of the old team, in a season 4.\n\nDuring all of these phases, there will be parallel communication phases related to\n- the communication and reporting of the program in the forum: we need to, indeed, cover this for 12 + 6 + 3 months of the program\n- the communication with Arbitrum Foundation: as stated, upon completion, best of breed projects will be pitched to the AF to have them continue their journey in the Arbitrum ecosystem, either through a grant, or marketing, or any other initiative that the AF might deem necessary, knowing that this internal pitch might not necessarily spark any follow up\n- the communication with GCP, in the same fashion of the AF, once the fund will have their thesis and infrastructure up\n- any communication with any other stakeholder or initiative that might be deemed relevant by the team or the DAO.\n\n## Domains\n\nSo far the program has run with four main domains:\n\n1. New Protocols and Ideas: A general bucket encompassing not only protocols, but also platforms, governance tooling, and other projects not specifically falling into other domains.\n2. Education, Community Growth and Events: A domain focused on physical events and educational material for Arbitrum.\n3. Dev Tooling on One and Nova: A technical domain oriented toward developer tooling and promoting Arbitrum Nova adoption.\n4. Gaming: A domain dedicated to web3 gaming and infra, web3 KOL gaming activities, and all video gaming-related projects.\n\nAll these domains remain pillars of our DAO today, even more so than a year ago. We are, for better or worse (though mostly better), the most accessible DAO in crypto, the first ecosystem to create a gaming fund of the size of GCP, and we have a technology stack that enables permissionless creation of L3s. Our ecosystem's nature and soul, combined with the entry-level grant structure of this program and the diversity we inevitably achieve through it, provides strong justification to maintain all four domains. While most operational changes will be in the framework that moves projects from this program to others, we plan to specify domains based on relevant stakeholders’ feedback (Arbitrum Foundation, OCL, Delegates) to add more specificity and better tailored results.\n\n### Education, Community Growth and Events\n\nThe domain has seen significant attention, receiving the highest number of proposals in both seasons. Through discussions with Foundation members and key stakeholders, two additional focus areas have emerged where the grant program can provide value:\n\nEvents Focus:\n\n* While continuing to serve the broader community, emphasis will be placed on amplifying Arbitrum's presence in key global markets and events\n* This will complement the Foundation's growth efforts in specific regions such as, in random order, SEA, USA, LatAm and others\n* The program will maintain an open approach, not limiting itself to these regions\n* Regular coordination with the Foundation's marketing department will help identify synergies between grantee proposals and events organized by the Foundation or other key ecosystem players\n* The DA will be mindful about any request of grantees for presence of personnel of the Arbitrum Foundation in the events: while this can, in some cases, be accommodated, is not always possible.\n\nDeveloper Relations:\n\n* Increased focus on DevRel content for both One and Stylus\n* Examples include, but are not limited to, video tutorials\n* Goal is to foster technology stack adoption through expanded community-created educational materials\n* This branch can partially overlap with and be covered/complemente by the Dev Tooling domain.\n\nTo reiterate: the domain won’t change its nature to only serve requests such as the one mentioned in the above examples, but might give in some cases more weights in the evaluation as there is value added in coordination with the broad ecosystem. The DA will still retain all its liberty of evaluation.\n\n### Gaming\n\nThe gaming vertical has gained increased attention throughout the year in Arbitrum, partly due to the GCP initiative. Key stakeholders, including OCL, have identified a primary need: Arbitrum Games should begin targeting the web2 gaming industry, creators and gamers.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the grantee budget cap of $50,000 isn't sufficient to attract web2 developers, we can broaden the domain's scope by focusing on user acquisition through initiatives such as:\n\n* Content creation for YouTube and TikTok\n* Twitch streams\n* Other KOL initiatives targeting the web2 gaming segment\n* Grant proposal tuned toward KPI such as amount of reach, target impressions and others\n* Independent publications like newsletters, blogs, and channels.\n\nImportant notes:\n\n* The domain, while expanding, will still maintain its existing focus, which is financing teams to bootstrap or expand web3 games, web3 game related infrastructure and web3 gaming services in the Arbitrum ecosystem while expanding to include these new initiatives\n* Success on the expanded scope will largely depend on selecting a strong candidate or team with specific experience and reach in this segment\n* These requirements will be reflected in the election criteria.\n\n### Dev Tooling on One and Stylus\n\nThe Dev Tooling will undergo changes based on what the Arbitrum ecosystem has achieved, both technologically and in terms of PMF, in the last 12 months.\n\nNova, initially included in the scope, hasn’t seen the forecasted adoption. At the same time we have seen a big conviction bet on Stylus.\n\nWhile it doesn’t make sense to exclude specifically Nova, it can’t be anymore one of the focus of the domain, which will be now called \"Dev Tooling on One and Stylus,\" incorporating the recent Stylus release. There shouldn’t be any consistent overlap with the current year-long \"Stylus Spring\" program for several reasons:\n\n* Different funding amounts (up to $50,000 in DA program vs. potentially $200-500,000 for Stylus Sprint)\n* Different application windows (always open in DA program vs. 8-weeks application period in Stylus Spring)\n* Broader scope (Dev Tooling domain will likely continue to primarily operate on Arbitrum One).\n\nThe rubric will also be modified to put emphasis on Telegram’s tooling such as trading bots, fairly available in other ecosystems but less widespread in Arbitrum.\n\n### New Protocols and Ideas\n\nThe \"New Protocols and Ideas\" domain will remain the most general capture-oriented domain, as it has been in the last two seasons. Its inherent generality enables it to cover both classic ideas, like financing DeFi protocols, and DAO-specific needs like governance tooling. This domain will remain largely unchanged, except for maintaining constant alignment with the Foundation and other stakeholders on what is considered important and valuable when assigning grants. Additionally, there will be attention paid to the evolving narratives driving the broader market.\n\n### Orbit Chains\n\nThere has been growing interest in a possible fifth domain related to Orbit chains. Many delegates have shown interest in or directly requested funding for an Orbit chains program, which is also supported by the existing [working group](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/rfc-arbitrum-as-the-home-of-builders-embracing-chain-abstraction/27250?u=jojo).\n\nThe Orbit Chains domain will have the mission to:\n\n* Enable Arbitrum protocols to expand their dApps to specific Orbit chains\n* Deploy technological solutions aimed at addressing current user experience fragmentation\n* Bootstrap solutions built on top of the [2024-2025 Offchain Labs roadmap](https://medium.com/offchainlabs/your-chain-your-rules-offchain-labs-technical-roadmap-to-fuel-arbitrum-innovation-f787f2e85966).\n\nThe Orbit chain domain won’t cover the deployment of new Orbit chains, since this is a mission that is currently facilitated by the Foundation. This doesn’t mean that a project can’t have, in its milestone, the deployment of its own chain if that is part of a broader plan; but this can’t be the main focus of the proposal.\n\nThe rubric and template will be drafted in detail with the elected team member, following the same process used for the other domain rubrics ([1](https://arbitrum.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=66f2dec58868f5130ac75e42), [2](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32), [3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt), [4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)).\n\nAcknowledging that the DAO might consider it premature to launch an Orbit domain, particularly before seeing results from the related working group, the snapshot will provide an option to exclude it from the current program. This domain could then be integrated later during the program's one-year duration.\nAs for the current iteration, we propose [MaxLomu](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/maxlomu/summary) as lead for the Orbit domain. While we can accommodate the DAO's preference for elections in this domain, we believe there would be no better lead than him, given his background and current working group proposal.\n\n## Modularity\n\nSeveral parties have expressed interest in adding new domains to the DA program.\n\nWhile it wouldn't be wise to expand the program further at this time, new domains might be needed at different intervals, as illustrated by the Orbit domain example, where the DAO might require a new domain program six months from now. For this reason, Season 3 is designed to be modular.\n\nIf the DAO votes to allocate capital for a new domain, it can be integrated into the current program by leveraging the existing infrastructure and Program Manager. The costs for adding domains would vary based on specific implementation requirements:\n\n* For domains requiring no additional Questbook expansion and maintaining equivalent PM workload:\n  * Platform costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * PM costs: Additional $1K/month\n  * One new Domain Allocator required\n\nNote that:\n\n* New programs may operate with their own independent teams\n* Integration of the Orbit Chains domain, whether at the start of Season 3 or later, will not incur additional costs\n\n## What does success look like\n\nEvaluating success for an entry-level grant program can be challenging. The evaluation primarily focuses on three key metrics:\n\n1. **Number of Grant Applications**: The program has grown over the past two seasons with increased proposal submissions. We expect to maintain or exceed this level of interest. This KPI should be primarily compared to Season 2's metrics, as Season 1 had both lower funding and a lower cap ($25,000).\n2. **Grant Completion Rate**: As an entry-level program serving primarily small and new teams, the risk of incomplete projects is higher compared to more mature programs. The completion rate will largely depend on DAs' judgment in approving teams they trust to deliver. This metric should also be benchmarked against Season 2's performance for consistent comparison.\n3. **Long-term Project Sustainability**: A new metric will track how many teams are still building on their original project and remaining on Arbitrum three months after grant completion. As this is a new measurement not present in previous seasons, we won't have comparative data unless we retroactively measure Season 2 projects in nine months.\n\n## Election Process\n\nThe election process will follow established best practices as outlined in the [Code of Conduct](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x2e701a942a8ed6f9ec8302cea866ab08648eeef0d07170814e3a3c3eb4e48415):\n\n* Two-week candidacy period\n* Candidates (person, entity or team) may apply for only one domain\n* Entities or Teams applying for any domain must designate a single individual as their point of contact\n* One-week snapshot election with shielded option enabled and weighted voting.\n\n## Resignation of DAs and PMs\n\nIn recognition that one year is a relatively long period for a DAO's program, procedures must be established for cases where team members cannot complete their tenure. If a member resigns, they will assist with the transition, and the team will attempt to source a replacement. A snapshot vote will be held with two options: \"Yes, proceed with the new member\" or \"No, hold elections.\"\n\nIf approved, the new member will be onboarded to the team. If rejected, a standard election process will occur over three weeks (two weeks for candidacy, one week for voting). During any transition period where the former member cannot fulfill their duties, the current DAs and PM will temporarily manage the domain, including grantee collaboration, proposal evaluation, and milestone payments. Any compensation due to the departing member during this interim phase will be fairly distributed among contributing team members.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe RFC will request $1,500,000 for each of the four domains \"New Protocols and Ideas\", \"Education, Community Growth and Events\", \"Dev Tooling on One and Nova\", and \"Gaming\", for a total amount of $6,000,000 excluding OpEx. The requested amount will be in ARB and, upon receiving, will be converted into USDC.\n\nEarmarked costs are as follows:\n\n* Questbook Platform: $84,000 total ($7,000/month for 12 months)\n  * Includes platform maintenance\n  * Synapse subscription for KYC/KYB of teams and grantees\n  * DocuSign subscription\n* Domain Allocator Compensation: $422,400 total\n  * $8,000/month for 12 months (four DAs)\n  * Plus $1,600/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n* Program Manager Compensation: $85,800 total\n  * $6,500/month for 12 months\n  * Plus $1,300/month for 6 months during low capacity phase\n* Legal Expenses: $30,000 earmarked\n\nTotal operational costs: $622,200\n\nIf the Orbit Chains domain is added as a fifth domain:\n\n* Additional $750,000 to total budget\n* DA compensation of this domain remains unchanged\n* No additional PM or platform costs\n* Total program cost would increase to $727,800.\n\n*Note: If approved, JoJo will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2 at the start of Season 3. Similarly, if any of the current Domain Allocators will participate in the elections and will be re-elected, they will forfeit any remaining payments from Season 2.*\n\n## Reporting\n\nA more clear and standardized reporting will take place going forward. Specifically\n\n* The PM will report, once per month, in the Arbitrum Governance call\n  * This type of reporting might change format and/or schedule: if the DAO is interested, for example, it could be a specific DA call, or it might fall into any of the new governance DAO’s calls that we could change or spin up in future\n* The PM and the DAs will publish, once per month, a single unified report highlighting the status of the program\n* All grantees, of all domains, at completion will have to publish a report in the Arbitrum forum\n* All grantees will have to follow up the aforementioned report, after three months, with a survey prepared to understand the effectiveness of both the grant itself and the idea from the team, including but not only understanding if the team has decided to keep building in Arbitrum, expanding in other chains etcetera.\n\n## Vote specification\n\nThe DAO vote on Snapshot will be a single choice vote:\n\n* Yes: renew the program with $7,477,800 and 5 domains\n* Yes: renew the program with $6,622,200 and 4 domains\n* No: don’t renew the program\n* Abstain\n\n## Steps to Implement and Timeline\n\n* 19th of November: RFC for Season 3 and discussion with the DAO\n* 5th of December: Snapshot for Season 3\n* 16th of December - 5th of January: candidacy for the domains\n* 9th of January - 16th of January: Snapshot elections for the domains\n* 23rd of January - 6th of February: Tally voting\n* First half of February: refinements of rubrics with the new team\n* Mid February: start of the program\n\n## Fund Management\n\nARB received from Tally, with a 35% buffer, will be transferred to the Arbitrum Foundation for the conversion in USDC of only the amount approved; any ARB surplus will be returned to the DAO. Upon completion, funds will be split as per the following\n\n* OpEx safe: managed by the MSS, it will be in charge of payment of suppliers and partners (Questbook, Synapse) and salaries\n* Domains’ safes: managed by PM + DAs, one for each vertical with a 2/3 setup (the PM, the main DA, and a second different DA), will be linked to the specific domain through the Questbook website and will be used to disburse the grants. The safes will have the Zodiac Module for the clawback of funds.\n\n## Resources\n\n[Season 1 RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/14081)\n[Season 2 RFC](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-phase-2-request-for-continuation/21326)\n[Season 2 update thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/questbook-dda-program-update-thread/23672)\n[New Protocols and Ideas RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/120s88WVycDyP2pUfgcT0eE8ILuribuayHDnd5aeZxbM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4th1bgre9sv4)\n[Education, Community Growth and Events RFP](https://governance-seedlatam.notion.site/Domain-Allocator-info-0b00ff3a2ec4436f8fb5298c60c57b32)\n[Gaming RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIQA_kGeLsXQOZsIiGaNzE35TRTbqXBl5JauNt4LECQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ig7e612gb5vt),\n[Dev Tooling on One and NOVA RFP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/144gTfeKKXOtPxMTEB9d73wELepJ9mNPjMJHjvCSy3uE/edit?tab=t.0)",

The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",
