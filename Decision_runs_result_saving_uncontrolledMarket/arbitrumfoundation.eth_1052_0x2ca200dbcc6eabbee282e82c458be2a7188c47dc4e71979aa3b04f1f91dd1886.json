    "summary": "The proposal requests a 750K ARB grant to incentivize swap fee rebates on Shell Protocol to increase user activity, trade volume, and developer engagement on Arbitrum. The timeline metrics strongly favor the 'For' option with early and stable vote support. Market impacts show slight negative price and TVL changes but are not used as pro arguments. Forum sentiment is generally positive, appreciating Shell's innovation, community, and roadmap, with some constructive feedback on execution clarity and DAU growth strategy. Historical similar proposals also favored growth through incentives but resulted in negative market reactions, suggesting caution. Overall, the recommendation is to support the change to help Shell expand as the frontend of DeFi on Arbitrum.",
