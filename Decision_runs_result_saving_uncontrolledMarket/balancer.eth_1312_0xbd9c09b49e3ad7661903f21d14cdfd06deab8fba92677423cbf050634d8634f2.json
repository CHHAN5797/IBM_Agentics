The Maxis have played a crucial role in making sure our various partners have a seamless experience while onboarding to Balancer tech.\n\nThis positive momentum, however, has also resulted in an immense increase in workload for Maxis, be it on the operational side or partner management. The group performed exceptionally, although we had changes in our team structure with Shakotan leaving and moving on to work for Radiant Capital.\n\nThe combination of increased responsibility and workload are key factors for us to focus on automating as many internal and on-chain processes as possible while also making the partner experience as seamless as possible - both for Balancer v2 and v3. We took a lot of learnings from Q1 and want to transition to a more professional Dev- and GovOps organization. We will therefore focus our efforts on 2 key initiatives: automation and stellar partner experience for v2 and v3. To achieve these goals we need a balance of retaining the current talented team and having enough flexibility to attract new talent for our various development tasks.\n\nAdditionally, we will undergo some structural modifications to reflect these changes: Danko and the Ballers will transition into the Balancer OpCo (Admin & Ops) for administrative and operations, ecosystem liaison and community mod tasks. This is an ideal opportunity as we further decentralize our SP landscape and strengthen our DAO, while also focusing the teams on what they are good at. Learn more about it on the Foundation’s funding [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-year-three-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/5627).\n\nWe are incredibly excited about the road ahead. Our protocol metrics show amazing performance across the board and we are dedicated to make sure Balancer will continue to be the go-to blue chip AMM in this market cycle!\n\n## Initiatives\n\nIn Q1, we introduced initiatives which helped us focus our efforts to specific work domains. In general, we had great experience with these work packages but will make sure to not overcommit this quarter with too many tasks, as smooth DAO operations are our highest priority. Therefore, we will focus our energy on 2 initiatives resulting in the highest possible impact for the DAO.\n\n### Initiative 1: Transition to a professional DevOps organization with Automation\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\nThe Balancer Maxis have been maintaining and operating key infrastructure in the DAO. These components include the [Fee sweep automation repo](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator), [Reward injectors](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/ChildChainGaugeInjectoooor) and [grant distribution automation](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/STIP_automation). Furthermore, we were assigned the task to maintain and take over the OZ defender infrastructure making sure BAL gets streamed to all Balancer deployments.\n\nWe made significant advancements in Q1 but need to further focus on streamlining all these repositories. A main focus will also be set on migrating the infrastructure we took over from BLabs to a new version as the old one will be deprecated June 1st 2024. We therefore have a clear set of objectives to fulfill and also plan to use freelance resources to complete them.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Fee Sweep Automation:\n* Refactor and improve code base incl. integration tests\n* Provide transparent and meaningful reports so that all DAO participants (investors and partners alike) can understand the mechanisms behind our core pool framework\n* Work together with Mimic or other partners to improve fee sweep performance\n*  Evaluate and improve voting incentive placements\n* Re-evaluate Aura fee recycling\n\n2. vlAURA Voting:\n* Provision automatic voting as outlined in [BIP-508](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419)\n* Make the DAO owned vlAURA position easy to maintain (relocks etc).\n\n3. OZ Defender:\n* Establish a repository in the Balancer Maxis org\n* Implement deployment pipelines with the OZ API for professional CI/CD integration\n* Migrate to OZ Defender v2 and set up the enterprise tier subscription plan. The costs will be covered by Balancer OpCo.\n* Assess and negotiate the usage of a professional subscription to run our operations\n* Implement further monitoring\n* If possible, implement gas usage optimizations\n\n4. RewardsInjector v2\n* Finalize the new design\n* Write integration tests\n* Get a smart contract review\n* Make new contract ready to be used for Q3 latest\n\n5. Gauges and core pools\n* Automatic core pool detection and maintenance\n* Automatic gauge removal flagging\n\n### Initiative 2: Grow Balancer v2 and Support v3 Design\n\n**Lead**: MikeB\n\n**Team**: Maxis\n\n**Summary**\nBalancer v3 is in active development and set to go public with developer documentation and other collateral materials in April. Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It’s crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nAt the same time, we strive to improve the quality of the partner experience for Balancer v2 while also supporting the launch on promising L2 chains with our technical expertise. Balancer v2 will remain a core component of the Balancer ecosystem and we strive to make it as easy to use as possible.\n\n**Objectives for v3 design**:\n\n* Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n* Facilitate Hook Development: Bring innovative hooks to market through developer outreach and incentive alignment.\n* Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings..\n* Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n* Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n* Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n**Objectives for v2 growth:**\n* Improve partner experience supporting the marketing team with a consistent partner onboarding pack and process\n* Improved partner onboarding experience by streamlining internal processes\n* Streamline and simplify gauge on- and offboarding (incl. automatic flagging of deprecated gauges)\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s)**: Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers:** Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** YES\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** YES\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n#### 1. Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Leading governance procedures, ensuring their execution and integrity.\n* Facilitating technical discussions within governance scopes.\n* Setting up governance votes and reviewing payloads for DAO transactions.\n* Crafting detailed governance proposals and specifications.\n* Offering deep technological insights during governance deliberations.\n* Assisting in specifications to proposals for proper payload execution\n* Infrastructure and tool creation for enhancing governance operations.\n* Automating tasks, reducing human dependency in governance functions.\n* Creating UI tools that support operational tasks (past examples: pool creation, reward injectors, linear pool deployment [deprecated])\n\n#### Strategy and Business Development\n* Applying profound product and technical knowledge in strategic planning.\n* Engaging with new partners and broader Web3 communities.\n* Providing technical support and insights for strategic development.\n* Assisting in custom pool creations and new chain launches.\n* Managing revenue flows and direct incentives with partners.\n* Facilitating discussions on financial incentives and revenue optimization.\n* Acting as active partner support and assisting new partners navigate the ecosystem\n\n#### 3. On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Overseeing DevOps and automating multisig operations.\n* Building multisig payloads and conducting multi-person peer-reviews\n* Guidance on infrastructure-related aspects.\n* Overseeing Stipend Distribution Automation\n* Coordinating protocol fee sweep automation\n* Core development, aiding in automation and data management.\n* Smart contract development(when needed)\n* Taking over on chain automation for OZ Defender and migrating to new version of it\n* Support in technical best practices.\n* Bi-weekly fees processing and reporting\n* Grant program management and operations (if applicable)\n\n#### 4. Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Designing pools for the protocol, aligning with governance specifications.\n* Liaising with the ecosystem for synchronized functionality and growth.\n* Assistance in pool design and migration to v3\n* Token whitelisting and front-end testing.\n* Assisting in the technical aspects of pool and gauge creation.\n* Testing of v3 front-end infrastructure\n\n#### 5. Data Analytics and Reporting\n* Spearheading data analytics, offering valuable insights through reports and dashboards.\n* Maintaining high-level expertise in protocol-related data.\n* Providing quarterly financial reports\n* Assisting in data handling, contributing to informed decision-making.\n\n#### Length of Engagement & Budget\n\nThe biggest adjustment in the Maxis funding proposal is the allocation of $60k USDC for discretionary budget for the entire quarter. Main reasons are the increased demand in resources to conclude tasks as described in the automation initiative like smart contract reviews, resource allocation for the OZ defender integration and stabilization of our platform. We will make sure to use these funds as conservatively as possible and will report on the usage in the monthly reports. Overall, people costs in USDC terms will be at par or below the [previous quarters](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420) ($117,000 for Q2) as the Maxis will take part of their compensation in locked BAL vesting for 1 year. The fraction of locked BAL for compensation across contributors is 56% on average.\n\nWe have furthermore deducted following savings from this quarterly funding proposal:\n* 11,880 USDC\n* 800 BAL\n\n**Length of engagement:** 3 months\n\n**Budget:** `165,120 USDC` and `18,625 BAL`\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n#### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold ~4.2M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q2 2024 would cost around 0.4% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.74% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.78M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.86% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~11.43%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nShakotan with address `0x8053484489b110181a6dba0b59dda887e433f470` will be offboarded from all relevant multi-sig safes and be replaced by gosuto.eth `0x11761c7b08287d9489CD84C04DF6852F5C07107b` (can be verified [here](http://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/541d1f22cc498623880e219011c4cc24b5208caf/extras/signers.json#L2)). It is therefore proposed to swap Shakotan for gosuto in the [Balancer Maxi Signer](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/multisig.html#operational-multisigs-signer-set-aka-balancer-maxis) set. This grants signership to a number of 3/6 multisigs. Safes, signers and permissions can be understood by reviewing this [Table](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/multisig.html#the-multisigs-and-their-addresses) in the docs.\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `165120` USDC as `165120000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `18625` as `18625000000000000000000`.",

Recognized as key contributors and the vital link between partners and the protocol, our dedication to the DAO is unwavering. As we embark on another quarter, our commitment is not just to continue, but to evolve – to redefine our engagement and amplify our positive impact on the DAO in 2024.\n\nThe third quarter marked a significant transition for the Maxis. Following the departure of our strategic visionary, Solarcurve, we embraced change and innovation. Tritium rose to the occasion, leading critical initiatives like the [core pool incentive automation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-457-core-pool-incentive-program-automation/5254), as well as securing and executing on the Arbitrum STIP, demonstrating our adaptability and resilience.\n\nOur evolution goes beyond roles and responsibilities. The Maxis are transforming from a collective of passionate enthusiasts to a team of full-time, professional experts. The new full-time addition consists of @Xeonus who will spearhead our strategic direction.\n\nOur mindful approach to funding allocation ensures an efficient use of resources – balancing USDC and BAL demands with maximum effectiveness. Our focus is not just on growth but on impact and transparency.\n\nIn 2024 we want to make the most impact by driving forward exciting initiatives while providing excellent mission-critical services to the DAO. We have identified four main (non-v3 dependent) initiatives to channel our efforts, while continuing to provide the core services that have been the backbone of the DAO for over two years.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nBeyond regular operations, the Maxi’s are focused on trying to create successful narratives in the Balancer ecosystem through various focused initiatives. In 2024, we strive to focus on a few of them, ensure that our focus areas have a clear leader/champion and some defined goals and that time and resources are available to focus on these topics. The impact of those topics is directly related to the achieved objectives.\n\n### Initiative 1: Growth beyond Mainnet\n\nLead: Tritium\n\nTeam: Shakotan (tech and operations), Xenous (data)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Grants Committee, Beethoven (Marketing + Beets grants)\n\nSummary\n\nThe initiative aims to further strengthen the DAO's presence beyond mainnet, focusing on Arbitrum, zkEVM, and Gnosis. The initiative emphasizes the successful execution of the Arbitrum STIP, but most of all development of strong competencies in creating data-driven narrative showcasing Balancer’s competitiveness, and collaboration with key blockchain partners such as Polygon and Aribtrum. The strategy includes adaptability to pivot based on market trends and performance metrics and an ever growing understanding of the KPIs that our grant providing partners care about.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Timely STIP Execution: Ensure punctual and successful delivery of the current STIP, including consistent reporting and active engagement with the DAO.\n2. Data Narrative Development: Work to build a competency within Balancer to tell stories about how we are using our emissions to drive growth for our protocol and in the ecosystems we exist in.\n\n  1. We should be able to put out velodrome style reports that tell our story.\n\n3. KPI-Focused Program Management: Stay close to various grant programs and look at successful grant recipients to understand the KPIs they set and how they achieve them.\n\n  1. Propose changes at Balancer to make this possible or point out why we are not well suited to meet the kinds of KPIs that chain ecosystems see value in.\n\n4. Next Grant Cycle Preparation: Identify potential grant sources for the upcoming cycle and strategize engagement.\n5. Feedback Integration: Actively seek and incorporate feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the initiative.\n6. STIP Comparative Analysis: Collaborate with the STIP body to assess and report on Balancer's performance in comparison to peers.\n7. Impact Report Creation: Develop a comprehensive report detailing the impact of extra incentives delivered through balancer on L2 ecosystems.\n8. Strategic Partnerships: Strengthen collaborations with Gnosis Chain, Base, Arbitrum and Polygon to share successes and apply learnings, particularly in the context of zkEVM scaling.\n9. Collaborate with Beets as much as possible to create a shared competency here.\n\n### Initiative 2: Redesign of the Gauge Framework v1\n\nLead: Xeonus\n\nTeam: Shakotan (building automation), Tritium, Zekraken, Zen Dragon and Mike B (design)\n\nSummary\n\nThis initiative aims to introduce an automated, dynamic system for evaluating and adjusting gauge emissions based on performance metrics. This new framework is designed to efficiently allocate BAL rewards, optimizing support for both high-cap and emerging projects. The goal is to ensure a more responsive and adaptable system that balances revenue optimization with nurturing potential future revenue generators.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Automated Gauge Evaluation: Develop a system for automatic assessment of gauges based on predefined metrics.\n2. Dynamic Emission Cap Adjustments: Implement a mechanism to adjust emission caps (ranging from 2% to 10%) based on gauge performance, potentially reducing underperforming gauges to a certain cap (e.g. 0.5%).\n3. Adaptive Framework: Ensure the framework is responsive to market dynamics and capital efficiency, allowing for more flexible and efficient allocation of BAL rewards.\n4. Rules around Duplication: Rules for handling the same Token in multiple pools/chains or the same DAO with multiple tokens.\n\n### Initiative 3: Support Balancer v3 Design\n\nLead: Mike B\n\nTeam: Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Tritium, Shakotan(tech and automation)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs, Beethoven (Tech)\n\nSummary: Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It's crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n2.

Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q1 2024 would cost around 0.9% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.3M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.5% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~10%.\n\nFurthermore, this table provides an overview of the last years impact putting this proposal into perspective:\n\n|Year|Quarter|BAL|BAL Price|USDC|ETH|ETH price|Operations cost|People cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|2023|Q1|48000|$6|$0.00|0|1201|0|$266,400|$266,400.00|\n|2023|Q2|42150|$7|$0.00|5|1795|8975|$291,257|$300,231.50|\n|2023|Q3|26025|$5|$132,630.00|20|1853|37060|$251,825|$288,884.50|\n|2023|Q4|31695|$3|$168,770.00|20|1652|33040|$271,779|$304,819|\n|2024|Q1|35718|$4|$108,095.00|20|2170|43400|$250,969|$294,369|\n\nAlthough the Maxis will have around 1 FTE more manpower at their disposal, the impact on the treasury stays nearly the same. Maxis have undergone internal optimizations in pay to reduce the impact on the DAOs USDC as much as possible given the current market conditions. In that regard, 49.5% of requested funding will be locked in our stkauraBAL vesting contract. We will also roll over $37,720.00 in savings from our Q3 and Q4 budget (bizdev, bounties etc.) and deduct that amount from the current proposal, which further reduced our overall demand for USDC.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\nLink to SLA (if going through the Foundation): N/A\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `108095` USDC as `108095000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `35718` as `35718000000000000000000`\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with WETH `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` by writing `deposit` with amount `20` to wrap the required ETH.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/307\n\n### Introduction\n\nThere are some significant changes compared to the last funding proposal and I welcome community feedback as always.\n\nNow that the treasury has a healthier supply of stablecoins and the DAO’s ongoing stablecoin costs look to be significantly lower in Year 2 I think it’s prudent to start paying the liquid portion of salaries in USDC. Thus the breakdown below will look a bit different from last quarter.\n\nWe’ll also be discontinuing Coordinape and adopting a bounty board for community contributors (this is based on feedback from the community and contributors themselves). We will share our learnings from our Coordinape experience soon. Previously 5000 BAL per month or $33,750 was allocated towards this, using last quarter’s BAL price of $6.75.\n\n10,000 USDC per month will be allocated toward the community bounty board. This is expected to compensate regular contributors with clear roles like Cosme, Gleb, and Dubstard for their ongoing work while allowing the opportunity for others to also pick up tasks. The Maxis will own the setup and management of this board and also provide a report on the spend in the monthly forum update.\n\nPreviously we requested 8550 BAL per month for salaries or $57,712. For Q3 we request 31,210 in USDC and 8475 in BAL per month or $68,500. The increase is driven by two factors:\n\n* Tritium’s salary is increasing a little over $5k vs last quarter - this better reflects a market salary for his skill set and his growing importance to the various operations of Maxis.\n* To partially make up for the loss of Coordinape each Maxi was given an additional 200 BAL or 1000 USDC (aside from Tritium)\n\nThis does mean each Maxi aside from Tritium is taking an effective pay cut as average Coordinape rewards per person exceeded the above figures. I believe this is prudent given the challenging market conditions where we must be trimming costs as much as we can.\n\n \n![bip-347-1.png](ipfs://bafkreick4g54svav42kw6jnj2ukvpuoc7f6idqjpv77x2fgnzshaqtlh7a)\n    \n\nLast quarter we asked for 1500 BAL for dev bounties. 875 BAL of that was spent, the details of which you can find in the below table. From this the Maxis have decided to pursue a retainer for Shakotan in the amount of 3000 USDC per month and 600 BAL to be max locked for the quarter. He will continue assisting us in our various Github repos to ensure our automated processes work as reliably and accurately as possible.\n\n \n![bip-347-2.png](ipfs://bafkreibj64iwi2uulfx4ml5pbttawvsjxezeficbd5fnjriwttcymik5v4)\n    \n\nFinally, we’ll ask for an additional 20 ETH from the treasury for gas expenses. You can check out [this dashboard](https://dune.com/scoffie/maxigasstation?undefined=) we commissioned to track gas spending. This may require supplemental funding during the quarter depending on ETH gas prices and if gas intensive activities increase, such as poking additional layer zero cross chain rate providers.\n\n----------------------------------------\n**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Solarcurve, joined by the returning cast of Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Danko, and Tritium.\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** Yes\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\nAs Balancer pursues its path for further decentralization, the Balancer Maxis workgroup presents community contributors aligned with the protocol's future and long-term sustainability. Whether proposing and executing innovative ideas, or protecting the interests of the ecosystem and helping third-party projects, Maxis have proven to be a key component of Balancer.\n\nOur Q3 proposal is effectively asking veBAL Governance the continuation of this decentralized collaboration group, and reading on previous [Q2 funding post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-230-fund-the-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2023/4562) might bring some additional context to the present proposal.The following will be kept brief and at a high level. More granular metrics can be found in our monthly updates for April, May, and June.\n\n*Multisig Management*\n\n* Linear (boosted) pool settings\n* Swap fee and amplification adjustments\n* Adding newly approved gauges to veBAL\n* Adding new reward tokens to gauges\n* Withdrawing and distributing protocol fees\n* Verifying and queuing all transactions before execution by the DAO Multisig\n* Together with Balancer Labs we operate the Emergency subDAO Multisig\n\nThese are some of the basic functions required to ensure smooth operation of the Balancer Protocol for all its end users. We believe the best metric for success is that most users are not even aware that these tasks exist – they simply observe a new gauge being approved by voters then appearing on the voting list or find protocol fees in the claim section every week, etc. Maxis ensure that the various multisigs and their relevant functions are used properly and promptly, and all transactions are verified for accuracy by at least two people.\n\n*Governance*\n\n* We act as verifiers of last resort for BIPs that require on-chain execution and we post BIPs ready for a vote on snapshot - though anyone with 200k veBAL can also post to snapshot.\n* Active participants in Discord and the Forum on governance topics\n* Several of us are [delegates](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/delegate-citadel/14)\n* Advise projects on Balancer’s governance process\n* Manage admin of the Governance Forum\n* We will pursue various strategic initiatives (such as BIP-19) at our discretion, either individually or as a group.\n\n*Automation and Tooling*\n\n* We work with Mimic to sweep and process our collected fees into USDC.\n* We run scripts that collect data and redirect fees to vote markets for veBAL holders to collect with their votes.\n* We build, deploy and fund [[Chainlink Automation Upkeeps](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers)](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/tree/main/chainlink_keepers) which handle regular operations for veBAL, and incentive management for our strategic partners.\n* We continue to develop more reporting to help validate and verify submitted multisig payloads.\n* We track and organize governance operations through the transparent and open [Balancer Multisig Operations repository](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops).\n* We build and maintain internal tooling complex and common tasks such as pool creation and linear pool management.These tools are not polished/require some knowledge to operate, but we share them with some support in our bizdev and community support conversations.\n* Members of the Maxis, often supported by external grants, build and maintain analytics for the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMaxis spend a good deal of time developing and conducting operational processes to keep fees flowing and governance systems operational and accurate. In 2023 we have started flexing our coding skills more and working to automate governance and partner liquidity management support operations in ways that are more “no-stop” and permissionless when possible.\n\n*Partnerships*\n\n* We manage Balancer’s Discord and ensure questions or concerns are addressed\n* Help projects use Balancer by offering advice or answering questions\n* We often deploy new pools for other projects\n* Whitelisting and maintaining token lists\n* We help with UI testing for Balancer\n* Seek out new opportunities to apply Balancer’s technology, primarily in the DeFi realm\n* Manage relationships with partners across the entire lifecycle from initial conversations to implementation to final results\n* Coordinate partner needs with other teams in the Balancer ecosystem, e.g. integrations.\n\nMaxis took the lead on partnerships in the Balancer ecosystem during Q4 2022 after the biz dev team at Orb was dissolved. The primary near term goals are expanding boosted pool offerings focused primarily on Aave v3, encouraging adoption of ve80/20 or similar systems, making Balancer the hub of LST liquidity, and increasing utilization of the veBAL flywheel (projects bribing, parking POL, etc). Generally we believe Balancer has made solid progress over the last few months on these initiatives.\n\n*Community*\n\n* We manage a bounty board, open to community contribution\n* Onboarding framework for new contributors\n* Discord moderation and security\n* First responders to user support\n* Bridging the community inquires to other Service Providers\n\nThis quarter’s proposal represents a big shift from the framework inherited from the Ops subDAO and the Coordinape reward system. Having an open community for new contributors wanting to join the Balancer ecosystem is a great concern for us. However, we have learned that bounties can attract higher quality and project-oriented contributors that might be more likely to be retained. Soon we will share more about our experience using Coordinape.\n\nThis new approach will allow the community’s marketing efforts currently under the Maxis to be handed out to Beethoven’s team plans for [community developments](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810).\n\nThe legacy onboarding program will still be running, reaching every applicant through discovery calls to help contributors understand the DAO operating framework (BIP-1) and set in motion their ideas for Balancer.\n\n*Project Management*\n\n* Lead weekly meetings with team leads across the ecosystem to align on projects in flight\n* Be the driving force behind the ecosystem’s top roadmap priorities and be accountable for their delivery\n* Track project dependencies across the teams and coordinate among relevant parties\n\nMaxis assumed the role of project management for the ecosystem in Q1. We are well positioned for this as we are the point of contact for outside teams & projects and we have established working relationships with all internal teams. Our experience in executing various initiatives in the last 9 months means we have a lot of insight into what it takes to take a project from start to finish.\n\n*Record Keeping*\n\n* We will maintain a notion page detailing the activity of each of our controlled multisigs. Included will be documentation on how to use the powers of the multisig so a future SP can easily take it over in case we are off boarded.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\n3 months.\n\nBudget of 34,210 USDC per month for salaries and 8,475 BAL per month, plus Shakotan’s 600 BAL for the quarter. We also request an additional monthly allocation of 10,000 USDC per month for the bounty board and a quarterly allocation of 20 ETH for gas expenses.\n\n**Total for 3 month engagement: 132,630 USDC and 26,025 BAL and 20 ETH** (ETH is excluded in the following comparison).\n\n*Comparison against last quarter:* Using today’s BAL price of $4.4 we’re requesting $247,140 this quarter. Last quarter we requested 42,150 BAL at a price of $6.75 or $284,512. Thus this quarter’s funding proposal represents a reduction in costs of $37,372.\n\n**Funds to transfer:** 132,630 USDC and 25,400 BAL and 20 ETH (to reflect the unspent 625 BAL from last quarter’s dev bounties)\n\n*Impact on the Treasury*: The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 would cost around 0.5% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.5M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~12%.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325\n\n**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation:** N/A",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/870\n\n## TL;DR\n\nWith V3 development ongoing, the grants program requests full funding to target new V3 integrations. This quarter’s focus will be to find, fund and launch projects with Balancer V3 to help boost wide adoption.\n\nThere are no major changes to the program and the committee will continue to focus on funding in line with the findings in the [historical assessment report](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458). Main points:\n\n* Funding duration 3 months from April 1st to June 30th, 2024.\n* Funding for new grantees - 75k BAL\n* Funding categories identified in 2023 Q4 Program Recap\n* Attract more projects to build on V3 and port over pools from V2\n* Run V3 bounty program (details to come closer to V3 launch)\n\nWith the recovery of funds from stale grants and an increase in BAL price, a small amount of funding is requested to top up the treasury (currently 68,190 BAL uncommitted) to\n\n1. 75,000 BAL for new grantees (6,809 BAL top up)\n2. 38,400 USDC for committee/support (29,400 USDC top up)\n\nAs always, we welcome comments and recommendations from the community on how to better develop the Balancer grants program.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nService Provider Name: Balancer Grants\n\nLeader(s): Burns, with committee members John Grant, Mike B, Steve0xp and Zen Dragon.\n\nPledge to abide by the DAO’s Code of Conduct 1 (or link to your own): Yes\n\nPledge to abide by the Accountability Guidelines: Yes\n\nIn accordance with the Balancer DAO [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1). This will include the Grant’s Committee:\n\n* Developing a monthly report detailing key objective progress which is posted to the Balancer Forum and Medium\n* Attending and presenting during the Baller weekly meeting (mandatory attendance by at least 1 representative)\n\n#### Domain of Operation\n\nAfter 11 waves of funding and a recap over the last quarter, this proposal seeks to continue the grants program as per [BIP-517](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-517-fund-balancer-grants-for-q1-2024/5465) with increased funding to support the release of Balancer’s V3. The program will continue to offer up to $100K USD in BAL tokens per grant supporting the Balancer Protocol's mission to become a leading DeFi liquidity source, catering to both short-term and one-off projects, as an alternative to the Foundation SP model's focus on long-term and higher-cost engagements.\n\nThe Balancer Grants DAO Service Provider will be operated by the Grants Committee, a group of diverse and experienced Balancer contributors. More details on the Grants Committee are below.\n\nFollowing on from the quarter of reflections and [subsequent report and recommendations](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-grants-program-all-time-recap/5458), the grants program will be focused on:\n\n1. Continue to mentor and deliver with existing grantees\n\nThe program currently has 4 live grantees building assorted integrations, novel use cases for Balancer pools and educational resources. This is down from 10 at the beginning of Wave 11 with 2 new grantees being approved this wave. The committee has assisted projects to complete their milestones and intervened where the project has gone stale to recover funds for future grants. These projects total ~$157k of committed funds yet to be paid for outstanding milestones with >$100k in soon to be approved grants. These can be reviewed on our [Finalized and Live Grants Notion Page.](https://quark-ceres-740.notion.site/7d33d4a52c604b719958ab7ff8f1389e?v=2975616ba49e4dd88550c817e23505f9)\n\nDeliverables: On-going support/maangement, monthly reports, coordination between Balancer entities.\n\n2. Fund projects dedicated to increasing adoption of Balancer V3\n\nWith Balancer V3 launching in early Q2 2024, grants will play a significant role in incentivising projects to:\n\n* Integrate Balancer V3.\n* Create educational content, tooling and docs to lower barriers to entry for teams building on V3\n* Create new use cases with Balancer custom pools\n* Bounties for highly active community members providing dev support, incentivising integrations for analytics sites etc\n\nDeliverables: Live Grant assessment sheet, monthly reports, weekly meetings\n\n3. Funding categories\n\nAcross these avenues of focus, categories to direct funding are:\n\n|Category|Why / Why not|\n| --- | --- |\n|Analytics|Continuously improving analytics and encouraging existing projects to include Balancer drives volume to the protocol. Clear value.|\n|Custom Pool Types|Custom pool types have the highest potential value to Balancer but are risky. These projects create new use cases and showcase Balancer technology.|\n|Education / Tooling|Very important to make Balancer more user/dev friendly and drive adoption of building and investing in the platform.|\n|Research|Research has been generally avoided after early failed proposals. Recommendation is to revisit funding research as optimizations or new use cases may prove valuable. Risky with low likelihood of payout but high potential payout.|\n|Swap Aggregators|Swap aggregators create more revenue streams. Strategic grants may be considered.|\n|Wrappers / Infrastructure|Can lower barriers to entry for other projects looking to integrate with Balancer and provide additional revenue streams|\n|Yield Aggregators|Only with a direct value calculation. There are generally sufficient incentives for yield aggregators. With no yield bearing assets, this is not worth funding. If the aggregator has the potential to bring high volume and TVL of yield bearing assets, then a value calculation can be made.|\n\n#### Grants Committee\n\nThe Grants Committee consists of dedicated Balancer contributors with strong analytical and support backgrounds. The committee remains an equal democracy with no person having a greater authority on what is approved or not. We rely on individuals’ expertise in different areas to help make informed decisions.\n\nBurns - Committee Coordination Lead\n\nJohn Grant - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nMikeB - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nSteve - Committee Member/Mentor\n\nZen Dragon- Committee Member/Mentor\n\nThe committee has the ability to onboard/offboard members as individual circumstances change throughout the quarter between funding proposals. Given the authority to approve and distribute grant funding, the committee can also self manage members within the approved budget.\n\nThe Grants Committee will continue to work closely with Balancer Labs, Ecosystem SPs and Ballers to amplify and support grantees.\n\nBy having a dedicated and diverse group of committee members and proactively working together with other ecosystem partners, Balancer Grants are set out to be one of the most effective grants programs in DeFi.\n\n#### Previous Performance\n\nAs a committee we have shown ourselves as:\n\n* Diligent assessors of grant applications with intimate understanding of the DAO and protocol.\n* Trusted to find and manage grantees building on core Balancer code alongside Balancer Labs.\n* Fairly recover funds from stale grantees when no longer relevant with 6 grants over the last 2 quarters saving ~30k BAL\n* Prudent with spending to maintain the grants treasury and limit BAL expenditure\n* Supporting grantees to completion by connecting with the resources required\n* Transparent in the assessment process and providing frequent information to the community about current grantee progress\n\nTotal application submissions and approvals:\n\n![bip-573-1.png](ipfs://bafkreidagscehjjwllvksjbjyhsgapuf4oxfxpjisi33ammcyctpbzua7m)\n    \n\n#### Length of Engagement and Budget breakdown\n\nThis budget contains all costs for the full operations of the Balancer Grants SP for the period April 1st to June 30th, 2024. Unallocated resources will be kept to offset the next budget request if successful. Due to the inconsistent nature of grants and the associated workload, grants team members will self-assess their level of contribution against defined Tiers each month to determine their compensation which is reviewed by the grants committee.\n\nTiers are:\n\nCommittee Lead - $8,000 USD paid in USDC - mentor and provide support/coordination for all grantee teams, administration of grants docs, RFP development, prepare and present monthly reports/community calls, wave round up, grantee announcements, budget preparation and SP proposals, .\n\nTier 1 Contributor - $600 USD paid in BAL - contribute to weekly grants meeting, grantee support and on-going assessments\n\nTier 2 Contributor - $1,200 USD paid in BAL - As per Tier 1 plus follow up calls for grant applications, mentor at least 1 grantee, RFP development/future grants program planning,.\n\nTier 3 Contributor - $1,800 USD paid in BAL as per Tier 1 plus mentor 2-4 low assistance grantees or 1-2 high assistance grantees or medium involvement developing 2023 grants program.\n\nTier 4 Contributor - $3,000 USD paid in BAL - as per Tier 1 Contributor plus mentor 5+ low assistance grantees or 3+ high assistance grantees or high involvement developing 2023 grants program.\n\n|Expense|Amount in BAL/USD|Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Q2 Grants|75,000 BAL|To be rewarded to grantees based on milestones following the full Grants review process. For sub $5k USD contributions a light review process will be utilized. Includes buffer for current approved grants in $USD to be paid in BAL.|\n|1 Grants lead|$8k x 3 months = $24k USDC|The Grants Lead Role takes ownership of the establishment and operations of the Balancer Grant processes. The lead is responsible for coordinating with Committee Members, scheduling and hosting meetings, carrying out KYC/compliance due diligence, maintaining Medium and Notion pages and leading the post grants report.|\n|4 committee members|$ 1,200 USD average x 4 x 3 months = $14,400 USDC|As per tiers. Allowance for one of each contributor Tier per month.|\n|Other Program Expenses|500 BAL|Any other program expenses that may be required for the smooth execution of the grants program. This may include (but is not limited to) to design, analytics, media, PR, research, legal, gas fees or any other specialized functions outside the skillset of the committee|\n|Uncommitted Treasury|68,190 BAL & 9,000 USDC||\n|Total request for Q2|6,809 BAL & 29,400 USDC||\n\n#### Funds to Transfer: 6,809 BAL & 29,400 USDC\n\nThe Grants Committee multi-sig (currently 3 out of 5) will continue to operate with the remaining funds in the Grants treasury (0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597) carried over and approved to be delegated to the grantees.\n\nImpact on the Treasury: The Treasury currently holds ~4.2M BAL. Funding Balancer Grants for Q2 is at a cost of 1.79% of the treasury’s BAL holdings (this is assuming all 65k BAL is spent on grantees), which annualizes to ~7.14%. The Treasury currently holds ~5.78M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost ~0.66% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~2.66%.\n\nAll transactions will be recorded in a Sheet maintained by the committee and on chain.\n\n#### ETH Address to Receive Funds\n\nGrants Treasury - 0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597\n\nCurrent Treasury Balance ~ 85,868 BAL + 20,400 USDC\n\nCommitted ~ 11,400 BAL + 11,400 USDC (@$4.50 USD/BAL)\n\nUncommitted treasury ~68,190 BAL + 9,000 USDC\n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ` will interact with the BAL contract `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` and call `transfer` passing `0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597` for `recipient` and `6809000000000000000000` for `amount`.\n\nThe DAO Multisig `eth:0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ` will also interact with USDC at `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` calling `transfer` passing `0xE2c91f3409Ad6d8cE3a2E2eb330790398CB23597` for `recipient` and `29400000000` for `amount`.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/516\n\n## Background\n\nSolarcurve has decided to take a break from the Maxis to delve into the world of DeFi and rediscover his Chad spirit. As part of Solars transition, the team has dedicated substantial time to introspect on our mission, compensation structure, and previous feedback regarding compensation proposals for both the Maxis and other Service Providers (SPs). This funding proposal, unlike its recent predecessors, aims to establish a clear and unified definition of our scope, mandate, and the proposed budget to fund the Maxis until the end of 2023.\n\n## Revised Scope and Mandate:\n\nBased on our recent reflections surrounding the work we have been and are currently doing, and how it creates value and/or is important for the ecosystem, we wrote this Maxi Mandate and Scope:\n\nhttps://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-updated-scope-and-mandate-q4-2023/5190\n\n## Process of determining Compensation Budget\n\nFollowing the completion of the revised Mandate and Scope above, we each individually assessed our time commitments to the Maxis and engaged in candid discussions about compensation rates. Additionally, Gleb, Cosme, and Dubstar, responsible for support and community safety, were included in the compensation discussions alongside the rest of the Maxis team.  Shakotn is increasing his workload in the Maxis as we move to automate the last bits that Solar was doing by hand. \n\nFrom that we concluded, that across all proposed contributors, we will be requiring a liquid USDC pay of **$255,800 USDC** in total for the quarter, for **7.75 FTE** (full-time equivalent) of committed work (we all do more), including 0.75 FTE of budget for additional operations/engineering resources where more. redundancy is required.  The areas of operation for our contributor roster span disciplines including: \n\n- Strategy & Business Development\n- Governance and Protocol Operations\n- DevOps and Automation Engineering\n- Economics\n- Eco-system coordination\n- Community Management\n\nFrom this point, we discounted each contributors pay by 20%, to a total of **************$189,150.00 USDC************** and then offered all Maxi contributors the opportunity to swap liquid USDC pay for 1 year locked auto-compounding auraBAL at a rate of **1.6X**.\n\n41.6% of the USDC took advantage of this program.  BAL was priced on 17-09-2023  at 3.25 USD, resulting in the following requested People budget for the Maxis:\n\n|Quarter|USD in BAL|$BAL|USDC|Total Comp|% in vested BAL|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Q4 (next)|$103,008.00|31,694.77|$148,770.00|$251,778.00|40.91%|\n|Q3 (last)|$114,510.00|25,400.00|$132,630.00|$247,140.00|46.33%|\n||USD in BAL|$BAL|USDC|Total Comp|% change|\n|Change|-$11,502.00|6,294.77|$16,140.00|$4,638.00|1.88%|\n\n\nFurther an additional **20 ETH** is requested to cover gas costs in Q4.  Gas spending last quarter was mostly used dealing with migrations.  Maxi Gas spend can be reviewed here:  \n\nhttps://dune.com/scoffie/advancedmaxigasstation?undefined=\n\n## Vesting auraBAL\n\nLocking veBAL for a year involves:\n\n- Serious tax complications\n- A year of diminishing returns fee flows and bribs.\n- The requirement to keep a high number of wallets holding veBAL with different end dates.\n\nThe Maxis are working to instead develop a locking contract with the following features:\n\n- Accepts auraBAL on Arbitrum and stakes it in the pounder there.\n- Allows the beneficiary to claim any earned $AURA and unvested auraBAL.\n- Accepts multiple deposits with different dates and lock durations.\n- Allows sweeping of the contract with the approval of both the DAO multisig and the beneficiary in case something changes.\n\nOn or around the date that Q4 funds are received the Maxis will use the full BAL allocation for the quarter to deposit directly into auraBAL.  Once the vesting contracts are finished and reviewed, auraBAL will be transferred into the contracts with a lock duration such that they will unlock on October 1st 2024.\n\nBased on feedback to this BIP, we additionally request 20,000 USDC as an available budget to focus on building a community business development and sales facility.  The Maxis role in BD is more focused on operations and advisory as subject matter experts.  We're happy to take on the challenge of finding community members who have the right skillset and passion to bring in new partners.  This budget may not be spent, but als always we will do our best to make some progress here/get something started here and be cost effective in doing so.\n\nFinally, we’ll ask for an additional 20 ETH from the treasury for gas expenses. You can check out [this dashboard 3](https://dune.com/scoffie/maxigasstation?undefined=) we commissioned to track gas spending. This may require supplemental funding during the quarter depending on ETH gas prices and if gas intensive activities increase, such as poking additional layer zero cross chain rate providers.\n\n---\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Balancer Maxis\n\n************************Contributors************************\n\n   **Core Maxis:** Mike B, Zekraken, Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Danko, and Tritium.\n\n   ********The Ballers:******** Cosme, Gleb, Dubstard, Shakotan\n\n   ******Interns:****** Gosuto(maybe)\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88?pvs=21) (or link to your own):** Yes\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1?pvs=21) :** Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation + Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n## Domains of Operation and Scope of Work:\n\n **Word doc we are working on.**\n\n## Key Objectives per operational discipline:\n\n### Strategy and Business Development\n\n- Provide consultancy services on how to best deploy liquidity and leverage Balancer tech\n- Deploy and optimize Omni-chain LSD liquidity in partnership with Chainlink.\n- Applying for co-incentive grants.\n\n### Governance and Protocol Operations\n\n- Governance\n    - Conduct weekly forum/snapshot voting process.\n    - Build, verify and coordination execution of multisig payloads to enact approved governance in a timely manner.\n    - Coordinate changes with voters, vote markets, wrappers and various other participants in the veBAL ecosystem.\n    - Help governance manage risk by:\n        - Identifying/strongly advising against dangerous governance decisions\n        - Coordinating with OpCo to identify and whitelist properly configured pools for the UI after creation.\n- Protocol Operations\n    - Development and administration of revenue collection and distribution systems:\n        - Fee Collection (in tandem with Mimic)\n        - Fee Distribution as per BIP-19 and various additional governance proposals.\n    - Administration of direct incentives from partnerships and grants.\n\n### **Maxi Ecosystem Coordination**\n\n- Facilitate legal/business contract execution for BizDev activities\n- Training and developing community contributors (Ballers) reducing downtime for users and bridging to tech teams and support\n- Discord management and Ecosystem Notion revamp (website and repository)\n- Event and travel planning\n    - Balancer Foundation Director’s workshop\n    - Ecosystem ONsite (April/24)\n    - Future hack-a-tons\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget**\n\n3 months.\n\nBudget of 48,590 USDC per month for salaries and 10,565 BAL per month.

We also request an allocation of 20 ETH for gas expenses and 20,000 USDC for BD bounties as described above. \n\n**Total for 3 month engagement: 168,770 USDC, 31,695 BAL and 20 ETH** (ETH and BizDev Bounty is excluded in the following comparison).\n\n***Comparison against last quarter**:* Not including the BD budget, this proposal represents an increase of 6,295 $BAL and 16,140 USDC vs last quarter. The increase in BAL tokens represents a decrease of -$11,502 in USD value of BAL token compensation when using the BAL price of 4.40 USD for last quarter and 3.25 USD for Q4.  The total increase in USD value of tokens paid in is 1.88% with 40.91% of USD value locked vs 46.33% last quarter.\n\nThe 20,000 USDC BD increase brings the total USDC spend up 31,640 vs last quarter for a 10% change in total spend with 37.9% staked this quarter vs 46.33% in Q3.\n\n\n**Funds to transfer:** 168,770 USDC and 31,695 BAL and 20 ETH \n\n Note that $14.220 in USDC is still unspent/unallocated from Q3/23, but there are a few outstanding engagements still ongoing that may be paid by these funds. The Maxis will provide a complete report about the 30,000 USDC Q3 discretionary budget expenditures by Nov 1st.\n\n*Impact on the Treasury*: The [Treasury](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zhdIt-6-yxI_Nma7rJqvCQVSoy6Ph0btu0yV1IXe0vA/edit#gid=0) currently holds ~4.3M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 would cost around 0.7% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~2.9% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.58M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~12%.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325\n\n**Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation:** N/A\n\n## Changes to Signer Set\nAs @solarcurve is leaving, and @Shakotan is managing the automation that covers aspects of Solars work.
