This proposal requests funding the Balancer Maxis SP for the upcoming 6 months from Q2 to Q3 of 2025.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nWe propose to work on 3 key initiatives that fully align the DAOs goals of becoming an efficient, profitable, innovative and builder friendly DEX. Looking back at our previous funding [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-694-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q4-2024-to-q1-2025/5991/5), we want to continue with improving on-chain automation and operations as we still see great potential in simplifying processes within the DAO. Additionally, partner management and advising product development go hand-in-hand as we are at the forefront of managing DAO interfacing requests and innovation. Based on these focus points, we propose following initiatives:\n\n### Initiative 1: On-chain Operations and Security Management (DevSecOps)\n\n**Co-Leads**: @Xeonus & @gosuto  \n**Team**: jalbrekt  \n**Summary**  \nWe have made significant improvements of on-chain operations, such as nearly hands-off automation of fee processing for Balancer v2, interruption free automation of BAL reward distribution as well as significantly simplifying the partner onboarding experience. We want to continue to improve and automate as many aspects of our infrastructure and fee processing as possible while also advising on on-chain security. The next natural iteration is the transformation from DevOps to Dev**Sec**Ops with support from Hypernative and Balancer Labs:\n\n* On-chain operations and monitoring  \n* Self-service modules and management (Ops UI)  \n* Automated Fee processing  \n* Treasury multi-sig management oversight and execution in collaboration with @kpk   \n* Leading of a newly formed security council of ecosystem participants\n\n#### Objectives\n\n1. **Manage and Operate Balancer deployments (v2 and v3) across chains**  \n   1.

Incorporate more monitoring solutions into the [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/chainlink-automation)  \n   3. Establish omni-chain gas station contracts to feed all relevant dependencies with ETH (or chain gas tokens) and LINK (gas for automation jobs)  \n8. **Fee processing and distribution**  \n   1. Own and execute on fee processing for all Balancer v3 deployments Balancer controls  \n   2. Oversee and execute on fee processing on Balancer v2, incl. Maintenance and improvements to our newly deployed protocol fee allocator v2 code-base ([see GitHub repo](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator_v2))\n\n### Initiative 2: Growth\n\n**Co-Leads**: @ZenDragon & @Mike_B  \n**Team**: @zekraken  \n**Summary**  \nThe Balancer Maxis core focus has developed to include operational excellence, growth, and partner experience.  As partners are onboarding into the Balancer ecosystem, the Maxis are tasked with streamlining the process and providing an enjoyable customer experience to retain as many users as possible. The end goal of the growth team is to simplify the process of onboarding and leveraging Balancer’s tech. We are dedicated to growing the product offerings Balancer has to meet market needs, communicating this to partners and the greater market, and finally utilizing these dominant products to grow the revenue and value proposition of the protocol.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. **Growth of Balancer V3** over the next 6 months to attain at a minimum 300M USD in TVL. The current growth trajectory points towards higher expectations, but linearly 300M over 6 months represents the current growth pace. This goal sets a realistic target which the Balancer Service Providers will aim to fulfill. While not in ETH terms, our DAO costs are denominated in USDC primarily so for now TVL goals will be as well.  \n2. **Driving the DAO towards cash flow positive** in terms of revenue taken to the DAO vs. costs of service providers. The DAO team composition is quite lean at this point, so our only option is to drive revenue into Balancer across the board to make this possible. Partnerships will do so via bringing in new business with the BDSP through structured configuration of pools, hooks, and incentive optimizations as needed.  \n   1. The definitive target is ⅓ of Balancer revenue or more to come from Balancer V3 by the end of this 6 month window. Due to large legacy pools such as Aave/wstETH and stickiness on V2, this is a fair target.  \n3. **Owning the market to product development feedback loop** lands on partnerships to relay what products are needed in order to drive further growth. This is demonstrated by the StableSurge hook’s recent success and the ability to understand partner needs becoming a tangible solution which increases business outcomes.  \n   1. Over the next 6 months the goal is to have new unique products launched on Balancer V3 attain over 50M in TVL. Including hooks such as StableSurge, MEV Capture, and any new invariants built in house by the Balancer Labs team.  \n   2. In addition, at least one new product deployed must be credited to this feedback loop process and an article on the initial demand to the deployment and go to market will be presented in the last month of this engagement.   \n4. **Grow ecosystem and governance participation** by onboarding 3 additional DAOs or entities to participate in the veBAL system at some capacity. This is to occur over the next 6 months and will include sparking renewed participation from any existing DAOs such as Gnosis or Aave. The goal is advancing the narrative around Balancer and aligning partners with the ecosystem.  \n5. **Streamlining and Transforming Partner Experience.** In tandem with the above initiatives led by @Xeonus and @gosuto to automate processes regarding reward distribution, payload creation, reviews, and partners interacting with front-end tools the goal is to have as hands off a process from pool creation to gauge proposal as possible. Historically Balancer SP’s have provided a “white glove” onboarding service to partners, which will continue, but in a different capacity. The tools in place will be utilized for partners to handle the entire process of onboarding in the majority of new prospects. During this time the partner management team will continue to assist, and drive feedback to the DevOps team to reach the final form of a 100% partner owned onboarding experience.   \n   1. This applies to pool, gauge, and injector creation with only minor necessity for hook configuration, amplification parameter changers, add_reward, and injector assistance in the cases where only governance or the Maxis have the ability to change an outcome.  \n   2. Furthermore reducing rate provider review lead time to a 2 week maximum in even the busiest of times is an attainable goal by coordinating with partners, the internal priorities of Balancer Labs reviewers, and the expected expansions to new chains + new lending markets for boosted pools.  \n   3. Longer term additional items can be covered such as a more streamlined token whitelisting process, providing images for tokens where they don’t exist on coingecko, and management of metadata related to how pools display in the front end (ex. pool summary, pool naming, points system, etc.)  \n6. **Driving development on Balancer V3.**  Coordinate with external teams to drive development of innovative AMM based products on Balancer V3.  This includes but is not limited to teams like QuantAMM, CoWAMM, Akronswap, EZKL, and others. In order to make Balancer V3 a thriving ecosystem of innovative AMM tech, we must seek out and work to build novel AMM innovation both internally and externally.    \n   1. Identifying promising AMM teams to join the Balancer ecosystem  \n   2. Assist with the development process, coordinate technical meetings, structure go to market strategies, and align on objectives.    \n      1. Over the next 6 months, launch at least 2 externally built AMMs on top of Balancer v3  \n   3. Brainstorm and execute on internally built innovations in the AMM space  \n      1. Readjusting CLAMM  \n      2. MEV capturing technologies  \n      3. Dynamic fee methodologies  \n      4. Oracle based AMMs  \n   4. Work with the integrations team to ensure trades route through innovative new pool types  \n   5. Expand pool offerings to cover a wider range of assets classes such as  \n      1. RWAs  \n      2. Volatile long and short tail pairs  \n      3. New token launches\n\nThe goal of the above initiatives is to expand Balancer V3 market share in the volatile asset market, of which we are currently underrepresented.    \n\t\n\n### Initiative 3: Interfacing with Product Development\n\n**Co-Leads**: @ZenDragon & @Xeonus  \n**Team**: @zekraken  \n**Summary**  \nThe Balancer Maxis have the unique position to have direct interaction with strategic partners while also running protocol operations. Therefore, we want to leverage this position to aid BLabs in developing and improving our product suite. Additionally, we aim to experiment with tooling or pilot projects to showcase the power of Balancer v3. Our intention is to focus on 3-4 strategic objectives and report their outcome in our monthly updates\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. **Integration and functional testing**  \n   1. Partner with smart contracts team to perform user testing, provide feedback, and provide additional requirements if necessary during build phase  \n   2. Perform data analysis and make adjustment to parameters if necessary for new pool types or other new functionality such as hooks  \n   3. Build additional tooling such as the MEV arb bot which allows immediate trade flow through pools before aggregators and/or other bots can integrate. Also seek to bring additional volume to Balancer. Share and teach tooling to any partners if required.  \n2. **Analytics experience**  \n   1. Interface with the OpCo design and BLabs data teams to build a native Zen UI analytics experience based on Dune and Subgraph data  \n   2. Advise the backend team how to integrate key metrics into api-v3  \n3. **veBAL experience**  \n   1. The veBAL voting page has been the last component that needs to be migrated to the Zen UI. We will consult the front-end team in product development execution which includes: testing, optimizing and interfacing with voting incentive market providers, Testing and executing on new voting strategies incl. A veBAL multi-voter module similar to our DeFilytica prototype that has been in production for a while.  \n   2. Improve UX around veBAL management such as voting, veBAL power and vote delegation  \n4. **Hook ideation and execution**  \n   1. @ZenDragon stable surge hook is already gaining a lot of positive traction for the protocol. We want to further explore hook ideas based on partner feedback and be involved in prototyping potential ideas with BLabs.\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented, gosuto, Zen Dragon, Zekraken and jalbrekt\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers**: -\n\n**Pledge to abide by [BIP-702](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-702-balancer-dao-service-providers-and-grantee-standards/5998) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards**: Yes** \n\n**Domains of Operation**:\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations  \n* Partner Management and Business Development  \n* On-Chain Development, Security and Operations (DevSecOps)  \n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination  \n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline**:\n\n1. **Governance and Protocol Operations**\n\n* Leading governance procedures, ensuring their execution and integrity.  \n* Facilitating technical discussions within governance scopes.  \n* Setting up governance votes and reviewing payloads for DAO transactions.  \n* Crafting detailed governance proposals and specifications.  \n* Offering deep technological insights during governance deliberations.  \n* Assisting in specifications to proposals for proper payload execution  \n* Infrastructure and tool creation for enhancing governance operations.  \n* Automating tasks, reducing human dependency in governance functions.  \n* Creating UI tools that support operational tasks (past examples: pool creation, reward injectors, linear pool deployment)\n\n**2.

Consult our monthly updates for progress [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/c/service-provider/balancer-maxis/18). To ensure full transparency on our working objectives, achievements and cost basis, we will update the ecosystem and community participants regularly through weekly meetings and monthly community reports:  \n**Ecosystem Meetings**\n\n* Inform ecosystem participants of our weekly progress and planned activities  \n* Coordinate collaborations and issues with other ecosystem stakeholders\n\n**Monthly reports**\n\n* Write up detailed monthly reports on key objectives  \n* Provide a financial statement of the usage of discretionary funds as in previous funding rounds\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:** \n\nThe Maxis have established a conservative and effective budgeting framework with a mix of fixed contributor salaries and flexible discretionary budgeting. Over the last year, Maxis have requested a large discretionary budget of $15k USDC a month. Based on our experience from the last 2 funding rounds, and our new team composition, we concluded that we will not need such high discretionary funds anymore. As a result, we will reduce the monthly ask of this position to $5k a month (from $15k a month).  \nAdditionally, based on our conservative spending framework, we can carry over significant savings of 75,000USDC that will be deducted further reducing our overall funding request.  \nGiven we are also taking over BD for the DAO our total FTEs will slightly increase from 5 to 5.25 while keeping the average cost basis per FTE roughly the same (see [previous funding request](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-694-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q4-2024-to-q1-2025/5991)).\n\nA detailed breakdown of our funding request with cost breakdown is visualized below:  \n![maxis_q2q3_1.png](ipfs://bafkreifppktx3upxmysc6djfioe45yeomjtxexmvx5p7j4k66miew3rj3a)\n\nWe are additionally asking for a BAL token grant of 37,500 BAL for the next half-year (at BAL price of $1.4). BAL will be locked for 1 year with a custom vesting contract.  \nQuarterly BAL allocation: $23,437 ( = 18,750 BAL)\n\nIn total our USDC and BAL cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 5.25 FTE:\n\n| Position | Cost Basis |\n| :---- | :---- |\n| $ / FTE / month (USDC + BAL vest) | $13,571.4 |\n| $ / FTE / month (USDC) | $11,904,7 |\n| Discretionary monthly allocation | $5,000 |\n\n### Optimized cost footprint compared to previous funding proposals (Maxis & BDSP)\n\n| Position | Maxis: Prev. Proposal | BDSP Prev. Proposal | Maxis: Actual proposal | Savings |\n| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| People cost ($) | $334,500.00 | $72,000.00 | $375,000.00 | $31,500.00 |\n| BAL Token Grant ($) | $61,874.82 | $12,000.00 | $52,500.00 | $21,374.82 |\n| Discretionary | $90,000.00 | $0.00 | $30,000.00 | $60,000.00 |\n\nThis results in a total reduction of our bi-annual footprint by $112,874 or $225,749 annually attributed to a reduced head-count (for Maxis and BDSP combined) and reduced ask in discretionary funds.  \nWith the additional savings of $75,000 from the last funding round **we get a total of $300,749 in savings until end of Q3**\n\n### Personnel Changes\n\nWith our new focus on on-chain operations, security, BD and partner management, we will further optimize our team-composition. As a result, @MikeB and @zekraken will aid @ZenDragon in BD efforts.@zekraken will increase his part-time contributor role to nearly full-time (0.75 FTE). Jalbrekt is now fully onboarded as a part-time contributor and signer and will continue to work as a part-time contributor. This new team composition will guarantee the most optimal cost basis and efficiency for the DAO in terms of Ops and BD deliverables.\n\n**Length of engagement**: 6 months  \n**Budget:** 330,000 USDC and 37,500 BAL\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` \n\n**Impact on the Treasury**\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently approximately hold 3,392,654 BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for the next half year would impact 0.55% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 1.11% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 4.804mln in stables (excluding stables in v3 buffers). Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3.43% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 13.7%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `330000` USDC as `330000000000`\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `37500` as `37500000000000000000000`\n\nEdits by Maxis:\n* revised Ops and Growth Proposal",

        "body": "## TL;DR:\n\n* Automation for core pool incentives. See code  [here](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/blob/main/fee_allocator/notebooks/pool_fees_and_accounting.ipynb) and results from last round [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16axBQBVNdPssQyjcIyb_4m4vOb5rKISIlrVMk7A2qjs/edit#gid=53204006).\n* Reduction of threshold to receive voting incentives for an epoch from $5000 in accumulated fees to <$1000.\n* Equal handling of incentive disbursements for Mainnet and L2s\n  * Core Pool incentives always flow to the pools that generated the fee, no handling by TVL.\n * Mainnet pays 50% of protocol fees to core pools independent of the pool fee  source which results in a 20% increased fee flow to core pool voters\n\n## Motivation\n\n[The Core Pools program](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) was first initiated in July 2022. The original proposal underwent many iterations, making it less and less reproducible. As more chains have been added, the current system has too many moving parts and manual touch-points to maintain well. This BIP seeks to consolidate learnings and the current state of the incentive program, while simultaneously introducing a new automated system for handling fee redirection.\n\n## History and Context\n\nThe Core Pools program fundamentally specifies that certain pools would have the portion of protocol fees due to veBAL holders being redirected as vote incentives. By incentivizing voters for voting on such pools through the fees generated, the proposal aligned short-term incentives with the sustainability of the protocol, creating a flywheel fueled by incentives for veBAL holders to direct BAL emissions to the most lucrative pools on Balancer.\n\nThe designation of Core Pools has generally been defined in various governance matters and through ongoing operations as pools that have at least 50% of their allocations containing yield assets with rate providers and paying protocol fees. Additionally, a number of pools have been explicitly added to the list by governance.\n\nThe degree to which fees have been directed has varied but as of [BIP-371](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-371-adjust-protocol-fee-split/4978) they stand such that L1 Core Pools & L2’s pay 50% of their collected protocol fees to support Core Pools on the chain they originate from. In the case of L1’s this has always been paid to the pool that generated the fees. In the case of L2’s various strategies were used, but often much of the available voting incentives have been allocated based on the relative TVL of the pools in each chain.\n\nAs the calculation of core pool voting incentives has so far been a manual process completed on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwUPpbYq7woVOU9vQ8EB8MY75I-1mauTLyDVwvKUDKo/edit#gid=0), the addition of “whitelisting” pools has been done by the Balancer Maxi’s prompted by a mixture of biz dev conversation and discovering new pools that were generating large enough fee-flows to work within the program.\n\nRelated to this manual calculation, the Core Pools program has so far not worked well for smaller pools. Currently, fees are only swept from pools if they amount to more than $5,000 USD. As a result, pools that generate under 5k USD per 2 week fee collection epoch often would have to wait a number of weeks or even months before enough fees accumulated to place a single voting incentive lasting 2 weeks.\n\nWork has been ongoing to automate the calculation of these flows, and the system is in good shape to start being used. This BIP introduces and specifies the new automated system for allocating core pool voting incentives, and describes:\n\n* The logic it follows\n* The relevant configurations involved and where they can be found/how changes to them are controlled.\n\n## Core Pools 2.0\n\nMost of the changes below pertain to automation. Additionally:\n\n* L2s are moving from distributing fees based on relative TVL to based on relative fee generation.\n* As with L2s, 50% of all fees generated on Mainnet will be paid into the core pools voting incentive.\n  * This simplifies/unifies the core pool process\n  * Measured over the last few rounds, this results in around 5% to 20% of the current USDC flowing directly to veBAL being redirected to vote incentives on Mainnet Core Pools).\n* Better attribution and more frequent sweeping/swapping of fees results in a more accurate fee distribution.\n\n### Fee Epoch Process:\n\n* Fees are swept and sold for USDC and BAL on a regular basis by [Mimic](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-115-balancer-smart-vaults-fee-collector/3966).\n* Every other Friday, aligning with Aura voting epochs, all available USDC is bridged to the Fee Handling multisig on Mainnet.\n* The [automation script](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/blob/main/fee_allocator/notebooks/pool_fees_and_accounting.ipynb) will run and generate csv outputs and a multisig payload in this [directory](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator/tree/main/fee_allocator/allocations)\n* The payload will be loaded into the fee sweeper multisig, reviewed by the Maxis and then signed/executed.\n\n### Fee Automation:\n\n100% of all $BAL fees earned are sent to veBAL as direct incentives. The below handling pertains to remaining USDC:\n\n#### Allocation of collected protocol fees:\n\n*vote_incentive_pct* percent of the total protocol fees collected on each pool will be allocated to voting incentives daoPct percent of the total protocol fees will be sent to the DAO.\n\n*vebal_share_pct* percent of the total protocol fees will be flowed to veBAL over 2 weeks along with the BAL specified above.\n\n#### Allocation of Voting Incentives:\n\nAllocation of voting incentives occurs per chain. The following logic is applied on each chain, pertaining to the total available fees collected for voting incentives on the same chain:\n\nEach pool on the chains [Core Pools List](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools.json) will be assessed for the USD value of total fees collected over the 2 weeks preceding the fee collection epoch. Pools will be allocated a portion of the available voting incentives based on their relative fee generation.\n\nAny pool that has less than min_vote_incentive_amount in voting incentives will be excluded from the round, and its voting incentives will be distributed to the remaining core pools.\n\nThe Voting Incentive amount will be split between veBAL and vlAURA voting markets based on the auraBAL’s total capture of veBAL. If there is less than min_aura_incentive available to allocate voting incentives to AURA, all voting incentives will be shifted to either BAL or Aura in a way that tries to maintain auraBAL capture split across the entire set.\n\nVoting incentives will be placed on one or more voting incentive markets such that the allocated fees flow to the proper set of holders, and are all paid out for votes that generate emissions over the following 2 weeks. Currently Hiddenhand is integrated, but we are happy to explore additional integrations such as Paladin, VoteMarket or other emerging voting markets.\n\n#### Final Payload\n\nAll of the transactions to place incentives and pay fees to the DAO and veBAL are packaged up into a multisig payload to be used in the process above.\n\n## Specification/Configuration:\n\nThe processes above will be used for generating and adding payloads going forward. The following [initial parameters](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/protocol_fees_constants.json) will be set:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|vote_incentive_pct|%50|\n|dao_share_pct|%17.5|\n|vebal_share_pct|%32.5|\n|min_vote_incentive_amount|$500|\n|min_aura_incentive|$500|\n\nThe [Core Pools List](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools.json) will be accepted as the current configured list of core pools. Further changes will be made based on payloads approved by governance.\n\nWhile the system has the capacity to [reroute voting incentives](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/blob/main/config/core_pools_rerouting.json) from one pool to another in case of a desire to migrate liquidity, none of this rerouting has been configured.\n\n### Future Changes to Configuration\n\nWork will continue on voting incentive automation and all changes will not be brought to governance, however basic intentions of the program and the specific parameters above are considered fixed and not to be changed without a further instruction from governance.\n\nThere are considerations around total gas cost to voting incentive//vote/claim. The min_vote_incentive_amount values seek to keep this somewhat under control.\n\nmin_vote_incentive_amount may be tuned by the Balancer Maxis up to $1000 USD without a vote in response to on-chain gas costs.\n\nmin_aura_incentive shall be maintained such that any Aura Voting Incentive always achieves well over the minimum votes required on Aura to register for a veBAL vote. The Balancer Maxis shall be granted the responsibility and authority for maintaining this value.\n\nAll changes to any of the configurations specified above should be made by a governance vote that includes a payload PR with the specific changes.",

This journey began with a complete UI and UX overhaul via the ZEN interface, reached a significant milestone with the launch of CoWAMM—a novel solution for LVR mitigation—and now culminates in Balancer v3, a comprehensive reengineering of the platform’s underlying technology.\n\nAs outlined by Fernando, in his post on the [protocol's future](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801), Balancer v3 strategically focuses on key priorities such as fungible liquidity, stablecoins, long-tail, and yield-bearing liquidity, and introduces new customizable options for extending existing pool types through hooks.\n\nAlongside these technical advancements, Balancer v3 provides a unique opportunity to refine the protocol’s core mechanics, particularly its fee structure and pool framework—critical elements for long-term DAO sustainability. The following temperature check proposes adjustments to the fee model and core pool framework, set to take effect with the release of Balancer v3.\n\n# Simplifying the Protocol Fee Model\n\n## Fee Model on Balancer v3\n\nThe development of custom pools provides the DAO with a unique opportunity to integrate innovative pool types and advanced mechanisms for fee accrual and redistribution.\n\nCurrently, a significant portion of Balancer v2's revenue is derived from a specialized fee-capture system on liquidity pools hosting yield-bearing assets like Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Reward Tokens (LRTs). With the launch of 100% Boosted Pools in v3, this established yield-capture advantage will be extended, allowing revenue generation from vanilla, non-yield-bearing tokens by deploying them into yield-generating markets. This approach enables any token with an external yield market to be composed and “transformed” into a yield-bearing asset, unlocking new revenue streams for the DAO \\- **a system that no other DEX in DeFi has**.\n\nAlthough the technology has demonstrated its product-market fit for yield-bearing liquidity, the existing 50% yield-capture fee has faced resistance from LST protocols and liquidity providers, limiting the DAO’s ability to capture this market segment fully. Given the critical role of yield capture in revenue generation, the DAO must reassess the current fee model to remain competitive and dominate this market.\n\nThus, our strategic focus for v3 centers on accelerating the adoption of boosted pools and solidifying the DAO’s position within the LST and LRT market. Additionally, we aim to drive continuous product innovation to continue to unlock unique revenue streams through hooks and custom pool logic.\n\nTo support this, we propose implementing two key changes:\n\n1. Reducing yield fees to 10% to increase adoption of yield-bearing liquidity on Balancer v3  \n2. Strengthening veBAL holder benefits with a simplified fee model[^5]\n\nThe veBAL system and BAL token emissions, being immutably established in Balancer v2, will continue utilizing the core pool framework and gauge system. This ensures alignment between token emissions and performance while maintaining veBAL's long-term relevance. Importantly, veBAL holders will benefit from concurrent revenue streams from both v2 and v3.\n\n**Fee Structure Overview:**\n\n* 10% fees on yield-bearing asset yields  \n* 50% on collected swap fees\n\n**Pool Classifications:**\n\n* Core pools: as per new revised core pool framework  \n* Non-core pools: All other pools\n\n**Fee Distribution:**\n\n* Core pools: 70% voting incentives[^6], 12.5% veBAL, 17.5% DAO  \n* Non-core pools: 82.5% veBAL, 17.5% DAO\n\n \n![bip-734-1.png](ipfs://bafkreia3hmaxolni5kvj5kgryxa7jbaz7xoeqmprpeyq2huqnlktxscyay)\n    \n\nThis model achieves three key objectives:\n\n1. Streamline veBAL holder benefits through an 82.5% total fee share  \n2. Aligns BAL emissions with high-performing pools  \n3. Maintains sustainable DAO SP (service provider) funding and operations at 17.5% fee share.\n\n## Modified Fee Model on Balancer v2\n\nBalancer v2's success as a governance token, and LST / Yield Bearing liquidity hub in 2023-2024 informs our approach to fee model optimization. While preserving the core framework's integrity, we're proposing targeted adjustments to align with v3's launch:\n\n* Maintaining current fee rates: 50% yield fees, 50% swap fees  \n* Updating non-core pool fee distribution:  \n  * Previous: Redirected 50% of fees to voting incentives  \n  * New: 82.5% to veBAL, 17.5% to DAO  \n* Updating core pool fee distribution to be in line with v3:  \n  * 70% as voting incentives, 12.5% to veBAL, 17.5% to DAO\n\nThis modification serves to:\n\n* Sustain momentum in successful core pools  \n* Direct swap volume success to veBAL holders  \n* Encourage v3 migration through lower yield fees (10% on v3 vs 50% on v2)\n\n## Revised Core Pool Framework\n\nFor a pool to be eligible for core pool status, certain criteria must be met. We propose to make it more clear what will be a core pool in the future:\n\n### Composition requirements\n\n* Minimum 50% yield-bearing or boosted tokens for pool types such as weighted or composable stable pools  \n* 80/20 weighted pools that utilize Balancer as their primarily liquidity hub (e.g. RDNT:WETH 80/20 pool on Arbitrum). Protocols need to apply to core pool status for such pool types[^7]  \n* Must maintain a minimum $100k TVL\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n* No yield fee exemption  \n* Fee settings delegated to Balancer governance  \n* If no protocol fee settings are present or managed by another entity, the pool can only become core pool if an alternative protocol fee setting is setup in place[^8]\n\n### Token Requirements\n\n* All tokens must have verified smart contracts  \n* No tokens with transfer restrictions or rebasing mechanics\n\n### Core Pool list maintenance\n\n* Core pool status is evaluated on a bi-weekly basis before fee sweeps by automated checks managed by Balancer Maxis \\[5\\]  \n* New pool types or compositions not described within this framework need governance approval to be added to the core pool list  \n* The DAO shall review this framework and propose adjustments through DAO governance\n\n## \n\n## Impact of Fee Change\n\nBased on the proposed fee changes, we have conducted [backtesting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dx82Hqcw53AwnXOkY3CFSJMshojjT7BzlsKf3zQa-FQ/edit?gid=759201376#gid=759201376) on v2 data and ran simulations to assess the potential impact of v3 adoption.\n\n### Balancer v2\n\nThe revised fee model adjustments to Balancer v2 would result in the following change in fee distribution to key stakeholders:\n\n* veBAL: increase of 46.7% of revenue share compared to the current model  \n* Voting incentives (to veBAL and vlAURA holders): 30.3% decrease  \n* DAO: no change\n\n \n![bip-734-2.png](ipfs://bafkreidvw3kwpd2kuvxti7yagbpfphiauagdgeqbvb7b2vl22r776ns6ji)\n    \n*Monthly fee distribution on v2: actual vs proposed (average of August, September and October 2024\\)*\n\n### Balancer v3\n\nWhile the reduction of yield fees from 50% to 10% in v3 represents a significant change, our analysis \\[1\\] demonstrates how optimized yield fee utilization will maintain robust protocol revenue. We conducted detailed simulations using 5 out of our top 10 pools by TVL, focusing on two key pool categories[^9]:\n\n1. Stable USD vs boosted stable pools on v3  \n2. Composable stable LST/LRT vs Aave or Morpho boosted pools\n\n \n![bip-734-3.png](ipfs://bafkreicxn2ivsa5txihwy7k7voxrj5bpr3wd2pzmlu2ykwz2n3o2d2ualy)\n    \n*Monthly income to liquidity providers comparing Balancer v2 vs v3*\n\n \n![bip-734-4.png](ipfs://bafkreiesnlfsj7gtn2tef44j2xvyaltt6qsvj7o45rfqfwruvkvprnxjse)\n    \n*Monthly yield fees to the fee collector*\n\nKey Findings:\n\n* LPs will experience a 407% increase in income from boosted yield and reduced yield fees  \n* Protocol yield fee revenue maintains 56% of current levels even with reduced yield fees  \n* Enhanced yield capture from new boosted stable pools effectively compensates for most of the yield fee reduction to 10% assuming the same TVL levels\n\nThis analysis shows that while yield fees are decreasing, the protocol's ability to capture and optimize yield fees through new pool types ensures sustainable revenue generation. The 407% increase in LP yield income demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategic shift toward yield optimization.\n\n## Launch timeline\n\nThe proposed Balancer v3 deployment schedule:\n\n* Q4 2024: Initial launch on Mainnet and Gnosis chain with strategic pool selection  \n* Q1 2025: veBAL gauge system activation with new fee model implementation  \n* Q1-Q2 2025: Multi-chain expansion phase\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nA detailed technical specification execution plan will be posted as a separate BIP outlining the modified fee collection mechanism on v2 and the implementation for v3 in early 2025\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe launch of Balancer v3 marks a strategic evolution in the protocol’s development. It brings significant enhancements to custom pool creation and extends the flexibility of proven pool types while preserving the strong foundation and market leadership established with v2.\n\nBy refining the yield fee capture structure and streamlining core functionality, v3 is poised to deepen yield-bearing liquidity, boost returns for liquidity providers, increase benefits for veBAL holders, and foster sustainable long-term growth for the protocol.\n\nThis proposal strikes a balance between innovation and stability, setting the stage for Balancer’s continued leadership in DeFi infrastructure. We invite the community to support these enhancements as we embark on this exciting new chapter in Balancer’s journey.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1\\] [Fee distribution modeling](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dx82Hqcw53AwnXOkY3CFSJMshojjT7BzlsKf3zQa-FQ/edit?gid=759201376#gid=759201376)  \n\\[2\\] [Balancer v2 core pool framework](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/partner-onboarding/balancer-v2/core-pools.html)  \n\\[3\\] [Historical core pool dashboard](https://balancer.defilytica.com/#/corePools)  \n\\[4\\] [Protocol Fee Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/balancer/protocol-fees)  \n\\[5\\] Balancer v2: [Automatic core pool list](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/4cebcb436926c7c0098563f7b562d40f13494b95/outputs/core_pools.json#L2)\n\n[^1]:  As with v2 yield fee can be set to be exempt.

        "body": "## Karpatkey Balancer Treasury CU Proposal\n\n## Background\n\nThis is a proposal to provide limited delegation of the Balancer treasury to [Karpatkey DAO](http://www.karpatkey.com) in a non-custodial, trust-minimised way.\n\nKarpatkey is a DeFi native DAO that has been constantly evolving to maximise capital efficiency, manage risk, increase security and optimise yield by combining industry-leading research with best-in-class tooling to prevent collateral liquidation. \n\nOur operation would be completely transparent at all times, and any member of Balancer DAO would be able to monitor it on-chain and through the weekly reports posted on the Balancer Forum. \\\nAlso, Karpatkey would suggest the creation of a Treasury Core Unit (CU) within Balancer DAO. If Balancer DAO approves this initiative, we would hire full time contributors to work exclusively with Balancer under our guidance and training. The scope of the CU would be determined after the assessment meetings where Karpatkey would find out Balancer’s needs. \\\nKarpatkey has been supporting Balancer since 2020, by being a top liquidity provider of ETH and stablecoins, and participating in governance, successfuly proposing a [GNO-BAL treasury swap](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal/2110).\n\nAs a token of our long term commitment and financial alignment with Balancer, the performance fee (detailed below) would be charged in BAL and vested for 1 year. We intend to _hodl_ the collected BAL, and we would transparently report on our BAL holdings.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn order to focus on its core business, Balancer DAO must secure enough runway to keep developing its market-leading products, regardless of economic junctures. \\\nAn idle fund has a significant opportunity cost (e.g.: circa USD 120,000 a month for a $20M treasury at current market values). Therefore, delegating limited access of the treasury to a specialised DAO such as Karpatkey would optimise its growth through carefully curated and tailored strategies within a risk-controlled framework.\n\nThe chart below shows our past performance managing the treasury of our main user, GnosisDAO, when the main goal was to obtain a sustainable growth of funds with a low exposure to risk, before the focus was shifted to maximising the growth of the Gnosis Chain. As the chart illustrates, the yield obtained by Karpatkey’s strategies was greater than the yield of all the other DAOs in the ecosystem put together.\n\n![Karpatkey Participation Chart.jpg](ipfs://QmYtznUJRj7REvMnV2KgodwEiRTBDNB2b5mwLbgvBVRPgM)\nSource: [Autonolas](https://twitter.com/autonolas/status/1521853164638523397) independent research (link to original report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-3jTC3ycJYr2NzRFWeoQf4kb0EO2uMq/view))\n\n## Core Proposal\n### Trust-Minimised Fund Allocation Strategy\n\nThe process of fund allocation starts by Karpatkey DAO proposing a list of allowed protocols on Balancer DAO Snapshot, which must be approved by the majority of token holders. Once this happens, the target addresses and transactions’ call data associated with such protocols will be allowlisted in a smart contract, so that funds are always under Balancer DAO’s custody. As a result, Balancer DAO will have the power to withdraw or transfer funds without Karpatkey’s intervention.\n\nIf Balancer DAO has a specific need which wasn’t included in the approved strategy, such as incentives/rewards, payments, etc., Karpatkey would post another ad-hoc strategy including the additional services for Balancer DAO to approve. \\\nAn alternative would be to operate with trusted signers from Balancer, using the Safe multisignature wallet. Karpatkey would not hold enough signatures to be able to execute transactions on its own. Therefore, approval from Balancer signers would always be necessary.\n\nWe would put together a periodically reviewed emergency withdrawal protocol to be able to quickly derisk/liquidate/swap all positions in the event of a market crash, hack or any fortuitous event that requires to stop loss.\n\nKarpatkey DAO’s professional treasury development consists of carrying out tailored strategies that vary twice a week, adjusting to the constantly changing DeFi market.\n\n#### Daily Strategy Reevaluation \n\nEach step of the strategies would be designed and monitored daily by our research team, keeping in mind different risks and opportunities. \n\n#### Impermanent/Divergence Loss\n\nTo minimise the risk of Impermanent or Divergence Loss, we carry out the following tasks:\n\n* Identification of profitable and low IL pools (assessment of assets’ correlation evolution)\n* Definition of thresholds for exit strategies\n* Accurate IL tracking*, also considering different variations of deposited volumes  over time.\n\n*The way in which we calculate IL differs across protocols and specific cases within protocols, but it’s primordially based on the formula detailed below, which calculates the IL per LP token for any AMM with constant swap fees. Our Financial Engineering team is currently preparing a paper on  the equations that we use for IL calculation in different cases, encompassing single isolated financial positions and more complex positions including composability.\n\n### \n\n![IL Calculation.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifdeefejl4myrzqld2nzykkhg3yk6q2xrfwprumipk73hnz2r3ztq)\n\nImpermanent loss evolution tracking example:\n \n![IL Evolution.jpg](ipfs://bafkreihklmyqpr7qb72cct2it4jdvb442kvfjrcwd3o36gke33xhewzq5u)\n\n### Treasury Core Unit\n\nAfter reviewing Balancer DAO’s structure, we came to the conclusion that creating a Treasury Core Unit (CU) would increase the efficiency of the overall management of the tokens held in the treasury. If Balancer DAO agrees, this CU would be composed by full time contributors that would be sourced and recruited with Karpatkey DAO’s support. \\\nThe CU members would be trained and assisted by Karpatkey DAO, observing strict security standards. They could be on Karpatkey DAO’s payroll and would be in charge of the following tasks (among others):\n\n\n\n* **Balancer Value Proposition:** Improve the value proposition of Balancer and the Balancer DAO treasury\n* **Availability:** Increase Balancer availability on other networks and markets\n* **Liquidity:** Increasing Balancer liquidity so more traders and investors can acquire it with a lower price impact\n* **Balancer Health Monitoring:** Propose buybacks if we consider Balancer is undervalued\n* **Fund Proposals:** Any proposal involving funding will be comprehensively analysed by the CU to plan how token transfers should take place in a timeline, and ensure that liquidity requirements are met and executed properly\n* **Fund OPEX:** All of Balancer DAO’s operating expenses will be analysed and projected to meet liquidity requirements and make timely transfers if needed\n* **Drafting and Maintenance of an Emergency Token Withdrawal Protocol:** In case of a sudden black swan market event, the team will execute a carefully structured protocol to de-risk all positions and avoid losing funds. This protocol will be periodically updated to ensure it’s ready to be executed at all times\n* **Capital Optimisation:** CDPs will be continuously monitored and managed to prevent liquidation (more details in the Risk Management section below)\n* **Reporting:** Dashboard creation and maintenance to monitor the yield of investments, rewards distribution and overall treasury growth trend, health and diversification\n* **Bridge Monitoring:** analysis of funds allocation to allow the Balancer token to be transferred across networks without friction.\n\n### Yield Strategy\n\nThe yield strategy would vary weekly to keep it within target. It would resort to different combinations of staking derivatives solutions, AMM, same asset leveraged in money markets, carry trade, arbitrages, etc. Given the risk that it entails, we don’t do trading.\n\nIn alignment with Balancer’s treasury allocation policy, the strategy would not extract  value from directly competing protocols. The following protocols would be considered to obtain an adequately diversified yield strategy with low risk and reduced ETH price exposure. This is just a sample list, the final one would follow Balancer DAO’s preferences and risk profile:\n\nAave, Agave, Ankr, Aura, Balancer, Bancor, Compound, Element, Honeyswap, Idle, Lido, Liquity, Maker, Nexus Mutual, QiDAO, Reflexer, Rocket pool, Stakewise, Sushiswap, Swapr, Symmetric, Synthetix, Uniswap, Unit.\n\n### Reporting\n\nKarpatkey DAO will post a weekly treasury development report on the Balancer forum, and support in identifying data elements upon request from the Balancer community. Also, Karpatkey DAO would review data reported and assist in performing analytics and quality reviews to confirm the accuracy of the information.\n\nThe following metrics would be included:\n\n* **Portfolio Summary:** shows the current holdings in USD and ETH equivalent, considering the allocation by blockchain, as well as the allocation of the most relevant assets\n* **Revenues:** shows the performance of the portfolio strategy, displaying the current APR, annual revenues, capital utilisation and past performance\n* **Positions:** shows the complete strategy implemented for the considered time period, explaining the type of investments, protocols, underlying assets, expected APR and expected revenues\n* **Loans Management:** shows the loan strategy to quickly assess the health status of the active loans, considering the borrowed assets and funds, the lent assets and funds, the collateral ratio and the minimum (liquidation) collateral ratio\n* **Portfolio details:** shows the complete composition of the portfolio by type of asset\n* **Improvement Proposals:** shows the list of executed proposals, as well as a summary of the weight of each proposal\n* **Incentives program:** shows the incentives strategy, displaying the amount of assets used on each protocol.\n\n### Fees\n\nKarpatkey DAO will charge the following fees, which have been adjusted to make this proposal self-financing, without burdening Balancer DAO’s growth:\n\n#### Management fee\n\nA yearly management fee (in monthly instalments) of 0.5% of the AUM would be charged to finance fixed costs like hiring full time contributors to Balancer DAO.\n\n#### Performance fee\n\nWe’d charge a monthly performance fee of 20% of the yield obtained during the last month in BAL tokens, and every payment will have a vesting period of 1 year. We intend to hold it long term, as a token of our commitment to Balancer.\n\n### Termination\n\nBalancer may terminate Karpatkey DAO’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of Governance Mechanism. Kapatkey DAO may terminate this agreement upon four week’s notice posted as a new discussion thread in the Balancer forum. In case the termination is requested by Balancer without at least a 4 week notice, Karpatkey DAO will be granted an exit fee equal to the fees collected during the last 2 months, which will be paid in ETH. Regular fees will be collected until the day of termination.\n\n\n### Custody of Funds\n\nKarpatkey DAO is not a custodian of funds. The funds will be in possession of authorised signers of Balancer at all times. Karpatkey DAO will sign transactions using two addresses, which won’t suffice to execute transactions.\n\nKarpatkey DAO is not responsible for the loss of funds caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies with smart contracts or protocols which are not owned by Balancer or Karpatkey DAO.\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion by Balancer and may need to be (re)structured to take account of legal, regulatory, or technical developments as well as governance considerations. This document should not be taken as the basis for making investment decisions, nor be construed as a recommendation to engage in any transactions.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, Karpatkey DAO would post a yield strategy in Balancer’s Snapshot, holding a broad list of protocol options without granular specification of parameters nor exact moment when transactions would be executed. We would then operate within those boundaries, without having to go through a DAO-wide vote on every trade, while ensuring that only transactions approved by Balancer DAO could be carried out by Karpatkey DAO. \\\nAlternatively, at least one trusted signer should be appointed by Balancer to approve each transaction. This could be a member of the Treasury Core Unit.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Risk Management\n\nEvery decision made and action taken weighs in risk exposure. Most large treasury holders have one thing in common: risk aversion. At Karpatkey DAO, we go above and beyond standard risk assessment protocols, and we have developed a multilevel approach to curate yield strategies, assess protocols and carry out transactions safely.\n\n(see the full list of risk factors in the forum post due to max char. limit for Snapshot)",

        "title": "[BIP-362] Restructure the Joint Balancer / Beethoven X Deployment on Optimism",
        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "Authors: Beethoven X contributors (composers and music directors)\n\nThis proposal presents an opportunity to position Balancer and Aura as the leading forces of technology on Optimism. It aims to seize the upcoming launch of Aura to leverage cross-chain Balancer boosts, restructures the network's liquidity, and propel Balancer, Beethoven X, and Aura toward increased market dominance. This proposal seeks to do so by proposing a modified protocol fee structure and core pool framework, similar to other successful Balancer deployments.\n\n**Background and Motivation**\n\nOptimism's bedrock upgrade has transformed the Superchain thesis into reality. With the impending Base Launch and the continuous development of the OP stack, we believe Optimism is poised to attract greater attention and liquidity. With the launch of Aura, these developments present an opportunity to cement the joint Balancer and Beethoven X deployment as a core technology and liquidity host on the network.\n\nSince the approval of the Beethoven X friendly fork of Balancer in November 2021, the partnership between the two protocols has flourished into a truly unique relationship. Nowhere else in DeFi has a fork become an essential SP of the original protocol. For the last year, we have recognized we are stronger when we work together, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve and building a better ecosystem along the way. If we look back, the joint Optimism deployment was the pivotal milestone in the expanding relationship between these two protocols. \n\nSince its launch in July 2022, the joint Balancer and Beethoven X Optimism deployment has demonstrated its innovative prowess, becoming the primary host of LST liquidity, amassing $60 million in TVL in April 2023, and generating approximately $370k in protocol revenue. While these metrics are indeed commendable, there is room for improvement. With the recent emergence of L2 veBAL Boost powered by LayerZero, there is the opportunity to leverage the impending launch of Aura and make considerable improvements to network market share. \n\nThis proposal seeks to optimize the current incentive structure to coincide with Aura's launch. Specifically, it aims to restructure the distribution of protocol fees to bootstrap an enhanced liquidity flywheel on the network and adopt a modified Balancer core pool model per BIP-19, supplemented by Beethoven X’s Optimism grant.\n\n**Current Protocol Fee Distribution**\n\nIn line with other Balancer deployments, the joint Balancer/Beethoven X deployment currently allocates 50% of swap fees and yield capture as protocol fees, with the remaining portion directed towards LPs. Based on initial governance approvals, both DAOs agreed to a [50](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xd281d8cad43c97814b2496270498c4396b16c0f2ce522d5bc554aae9fed4e4d7) / [50](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x2856e059b7bf581ee97ce63b36d79d85c3f27910ec5c79115de3d0d9fadc948c) split of the protocol fees as part of the joint deployment.\n\nBeethovenX's governance adopted an [additional proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x94ca4387a061af6df49ce3fefd9439e7399e7af152c59b56b370a43705eed4c1), where it committed to allocate 50% of its share of the protocol fees, converted to OP, matched with Beethoven X's OP grant, and emitted to pools as liquidity mining or gauge incentives. In certain instances when positive ROI was achieved, these incentives were directed towards Hidden Hand's OP vlAURA gauge market, but have more often been used as direct liquidity incentives.\n\nBeethoven X's grant-matching approach is a sustainable incentive model designed for long-term success. Other partnerships, such as Rocket Pool, have played a pivotal role in bootstrapping liquidity by directing their OP grants toward Optimism pools. However, the joint deployment has faced limitations in competing with the incentives provided by other protocols due to the number of incentives the joint deployment can currently emit based on the portion of protocol revenue flowing to Beethoven X.\n\n**The Value of Optimism Deployment**\n\nFrom January 1 to June 30, 2023, approximately $77.8k in BAL rewards have been emitted to OP pools through veBAL, while Balancer's revenue share directed towards the DAO treasury amounted to approximately $125.5k, resulting in a positive net cash flow. During the same period, Beethoven X incentivized pools with $56.6k worth of BEETS tokens, recycling half ($62.8k) as incentives from its share of protocol fees matched with OP.\n\nWith the anticipated launch of Aura and cross-chain veBAL boosts, Beethoven X, Balancer, and Aura will unlock more efficient means to foster liquidity growth. Historically, Aura has provided the Balancer ecosystem with an additional liquidity layer enabling efficient vote markets. As such, Beethoven X's current OP grant matching program can shift to being deployed as gauge vote incentives to direct BAL and AURA emissions to increase protocol TVL efficiently. If voting market efficiencies reduce, the incentive program can continue to emit direct liquidity mining incentives on pools. Aura has also [proposed an OP grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-28011280168279695) that would direct additional direct LP incentives or match bounties placed on any Aura voting markets with OP.\n\nBy leveraging the cross-chain veBAL boost and providing an efficient liquidity layer, combined with potential OP matching, Aura is a growth catalyst for the Balancer and Beethoven X deployment. With these additional optimizations to our incentive systems, we can ensure that our entire ecosystem substantially increases market share and revenue potential on Optimism.\n\n**Core Pool Framework**\n\nThe Balancer Core Pool Framework implemented through [BIP-19](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc), allows us to designate certain pools as \"core pools.\" Under this framework, protocol fees earned on other Balancer L2 deployments are utilized as gauge incentives for core pools on those networks, accelerating the adoption of L2s within the Balancer Ecosystem. BIP-19 was approved to collect and allocate 65% of the fees of all pools and proportionately direct them as gauge incentives to each L2's core pools to bootstrap their liquidity.\n\nGauge Framework v1, as proposed in [BIP-57](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-57-introduce-gauge-framework-v1/3604), introduced rating criteria for the Balancer community to evaluate all current and future veBAL gauges. This framework incorporates an \"overall\" factor, derived from the \"weight\" factor and \"market cap\" factor, as well as a \"revenue\" factor. It imposes a 2% cap, 10% cap, or no cap to gauges.\n\nBIPs-19 and 57 have also been applied to designate at least two 80/20 pools, Radiant and Alchemix, as uncapped core pools, in lieu of receiving ve80/20 grants\n\nThis proposal aims to adopt these frameworks for the Balancer/Beethoven X deployment on Optimism. However, we propose a modification to the distribution system: Rather than distributing incentives between core pools based on TVL, we propose incentives are distributed based on protocol fees generated by each pool, a calculation that can be efficiently derived using the [Beethoven X dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c).\n\n**Specification**\n\nThis proposal seeks to ensure that we bootstrap the launch of Aura in the most efficient way possible with two changes.\n\n1. Adopting a modified version of Balancer’s protocol fee distribution\n2. Establishing an Optimism core pool framework\n\n**Adopting Modified Version of Balancer’s Protocol Fee Distribution.**\n\nWe propose the joint Beethoven X / Balancer deployment on Optimism adopts the same 65/35 Protocol Fee distribution structure as other Balancer deployments: 65% of the fees used as incentives on the vote market for Optimism pools, and 35% goes to DAOs, with an equal split between Beethoven X and Balancer. \n\nIf approved, this action would take place as soon as possible to capitalize on Aura’s launch on the network. 65% of the fees would be utilized to buy OP and direct OP as voting incentives for core pools. The resulting action would see 65% of all protocol fees paired with OP from the Beethoven-X/Balancer OP grant, meaning a net 130% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives. \n\nThere is also the potential for further matching from Aura’s OP grant request. If Aura’s OP grant is also approved, this would see a net 260% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives for vlAura voters while the grants are active. Voters will see an increase in voting incentives that go towards pools of Optimism with the potential to increase even further with every voting cycle due to the positive flywheel effect.\n\nProtocol fees are currently collected every two weeks with all fees sent to the Beethoven X Treasury on Optimism automatically. Balancer DAOs share is then bridged to the Balancer Treasury on Mainnet. The proposal aims to keep this procedure to streamline the process of OP grant matching, with OP directed towards voting incentives for vlAura voters, or as direct Liquidity mining incentives depending on voting efficiencies. \n\n**Adapting the Core Pool Framework for Optimism**\n\nThe Optimism deployment will adhere to the Balancer Core Pool Framework that is in place for all other chains. However, we propose to add a slight change to the distribution mechanism: Instead of distributing the voting incentives based on the TVL of the pools, we propose to distribute incentives based on fees (yield and swap fees) generated over the previous two weeks. Beethoven-X has developed a [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c) that details a pool's contribution to fees and the resulting incentive distribution those pools will receive. While distributing incentives based on TVL is a good approximation, using fees as the underlying data is more accurate.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following existing pools would be designated as core pools:\n\n* Rocket Fuel (reth/eth metastable)\n* Shanghai Shakedown (wsteth/eth metastable)\n* Tri-Sonne Harmonic Crescendo (bb-so-wbtc/bb-so-wsteth/bb-so-usdc weighted pool)\n* Gyroscope ECLP (wstETH/WETH)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n* For this BIP to become active, Aura must launch on Optimism, which is planned very soon.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nVia redirecting a portion of Balancer's protocol fees to voting incentives for veBAL / vlAURA voters, the net percentage of protocol fees flowing to the Balancer DAO treasury as well as Beethoven X DAO treasury will be reduced to 17.5%.\n\nWhile this reduces potential future treasury runway, it also has the potential to bootstrap the TVL of pools that contribute considerably to revenue. Paired with a cross-chain Balancer boost, Aura’s Liquidity mining boost, incentives, possible Aura OP matching, and potentially positive ROI on voting markets, yield-bearing core pools will have the potential to see a considerable increase in TVL. To add to this, these pools are unique in that an increase in TVL directly correlates to the revenue generated.",
