        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/537\n\n**Summary:**\n> We propose the introduction of an 80/20 weighted gauge for $OVN on Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base with the pairing as OVN/wUSD+. This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDiscord: overnight-fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time. Our token has a cross-chain functionality with the help of Axelar.\n>\n>\n> Launch Price: $20\n> Presale Price: $20\n> OVN Tokenomics: [Overnight Tokenomics ($OVN)](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/overnight-tokenomics)\n> Presale Information: [Overnight Presale Information](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/ovn-presale)\n> 25% of OVN from Private Presale unlocked on Oct 2. and the remaining 75 will be linearly vested for 4 weeks.\n>\n>  Additional Information:\n> - We cancelled public presale and just used the money raised from private presale to bootstrap liquidity on DEXes. \n> - We have launched at 20m FDV.\n> - We are already live on Aerodrome and Velodrome Finance. We also incentivized huge amount of bribes on Aerodrome (7400$) and Velodrome ($5,700) (For Sept. 28 - Oct. 5)\n> - We have also provided 22.5k OP for our Beefy Boost Program that will be distributed in over 2 weeks.\n> \n> - The rate providers was also reviewed by the integrations team and deemed safe.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n> \n> We aim to create a competitive environment that rewards participation and ensures the most efficient allocation of resources. We believe that veBAL voters are sophisticated and discerning and they will prioritize the community’s best interest. Complexity is often a byproduct of innovation. Our past experiences teach us valuable lessons, enabling us to build more robust systems.\n> \n> While 80/20 pools have been associated with locking, the beauty of the DeFi space is its adaptability. Our objective is to leverage the pool structure for its inherent benefits, not merely conform to traditional use-cases. The goal is to amplify liquidity and ensure stability, rather than exploit emissions. We’re using the pool to its fullest potential to cater to the evolving needs of the market. As also noted, the proposed bribe per week represents a significant boost in Aura’s bribe market, should all bribes be channeled in here.\n> \n> The absence of a defined market cap or trading history doesn’t undermine the intrinsic value of the coin or its future adoption potential. The proposed gauge allocation, especially the 2% caps, is informed by a forward-looking strategy, ensuring that it aligns with the expected bribes and accrued yield.\n> \n> The gauge allocation is in recognition of the potential this new coin brings. Traditional metrics, like trading history, might not fully capture the inherent value and projected adoption. We’re operating in a rapidly evolving landscape; hence, a forward-looking approach is crucial. Coingecko’s preview status doesn’t reflect the groundwork and strategic partnerships that underscore this project.\n> \n> The proposal aims to push the boundaries, capitalize on new opportunities, and ensure the best outcome for the community. We trust the veBAL voters to recognize the merit and long-term vision of this initiative.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1071\n\n**Service Provider Name:** Beethoven X DAO\n\n **Leader(s):** Jedi, Naly, Vee\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** \n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):**\n\n### Introduction & Domains of Operation\n\n---\n\nOver the past six months, the Beethoven X Marketing SP has strived to play an impactful role in supporting the Balancer DAO's mission to be recognized as a leader in AMM innovation.\n\nOur efforts have been multifaceted, focusing on producing high-quality educational content, strengthening community engagement through social media, collaborating with key partners, and refining brand development and visual creativity. We have also supported core growth strategies and laid the groundwork for the successful launch of Balancer v3 in Q4 this year.\n\nAs we near the completion and release of the v3 codebase to the public, Balancer v3 offers a golden opportunity to redefine our position as a driving force in AMM innovation. Inspired by much of what was expressed in Fernando's recent [vision post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801), we remain highly optimistic about Balancer's future and are fully committed to supporting the ecosystem to the best of our abilities.\n\nAs the current funding period under [BIP-519](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-519-funding-proposal-for-the-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-sp-jan-jun-24/5406) draws to a close, this proposal seeks an extension of funding for the continuation of marketing services from July 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\nThe following sections will discuss some of the key initiatives behind our efforts over the past six months as well as highlight future goals for the next half.\n\n### Key Initiatives & Success Metrics\n\n---\n\n### Education & Content\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\nDriving awareness of Balancer’s core value propositions is the cornerstone of our content creation strategy. As such, we have continued to focus on educational content to enhance the understanding and adoption of Balancer’s core product market fit (PMFs).\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. **Yield Bearing Hub**\n    - With innovations in Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), yield-bearing stablecoins, and Liquid Restaked Tokens (LRTs), Balancer's technology has been crucial in optimizing liquidity for yield-bearing assets. We have focused on developing articles and educational resources to illustrate the benefits of Balancer’s technology in this area.\n\n**Key Content:**\n\nYield Bearing Asset Thesis:\n\nhttps://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-the-yield-bearing-asset-thesis-f44489ba2deb\n\nBalancer showcasing it’s PMF with the Liquid Re-staking Narrative: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749779120450601256\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1759582409526521859\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1760673085131518220\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1768623354532253908\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1780991371966607684\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1788705818814394807\n\nBrought the first Yield Bearing SOL asset to the Ethereum Ecosystem: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785028800797175858\n\nShowcasing innovative solutions for staked stablecoins:\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1786391170194821623\n\n2. **8020**\n\n- The 8020 initiative continues to drive significant value for the Balancer ecosystem. We have continued to develop educational resources to demonstrate the benefits of this model as well as collaborated closely with various projects to co-market and highlight their success stories.\n\n**Key Content:**\n\nve8020 notion pack for partners:\n[The ve8020 Initiative](https://www.notion.so/The-ve8020-Initiative-f13e066945d44d95846d9eb8163180c9?pvs=21) \n\nContinued the ve8020 narrative on X:\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749001706430718356\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1749930025384853982\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1767500752740835777\n\n3. **Building on Balancer**\n\n- Balancer distinguishes itself as a platform enabling true AMM experimentation and innovation. We have strived to bring awareness to this by showcasing Balancer’s unique product-market fit (PMF) and highlighting the various AMMs built on Balancer by external teams\n\n**Key content:**\n\nExplaining the cold start problem: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1790455748016668699\n\nShowcasing custom AMM adoption across DeFi: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1798414505325871318\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1801322082698961038\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1784942600925196680\n\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1796228354850570732\n\nBreaking down new custom pools: \nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785747336049930252\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1785748797340979451\nhttps://x.com/Balancer/status/1793264880226640373\n\n### Partnerships & Strategy\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nBalancer’s long-term success is intrinsically linked to the success of the protocols and products built on our platform. As such we have strived to build stronger relationships with key partners to amplify our ecosystem's reach, enhance Balancer’s product offerings, and drive collaboration.\n\n**Focus:**\nBy closely collaborating with partners to co-develop marketing campaigns, curate educational content, and ideate on community initiatives we have actively strengthened existing foundations and forged new connections within our broader ecosystem.\n\n**Case Studies:**\n\n1. **Gyroscope:**\n    - The integration of Gyroscope’s E-CLP invariant into Balancer’s platform has been a significant milestone. This collaboration has facilitated over $1.1 billion in volume, demonstrating enhanced capital efficiency and validating Gyroscope’s innovative AMM model within Balancer’s ecosystem. Gyroscope has been a testament to the power of Balancer’s infrastructure, setting a solid foundation for other projects to follow.\n    \n    https://x.com/Balancer/status/1795891066626789774\n\n1. **Aura:**\n    - Aura plays a crucial role in the Balancer ecosystem by aggregating and boosting yield for liquidity providers who stake their BPTs. Building a stronger relationship with Aura's marketing team has been a priority over recent months, especially after the disbandment of Orb. Our collaborative marketing efforts with Aura aim to significantly strengthen our users understanding of the broader Balancer x Aura ecosystem, drive community engagement, and showcase the synergistic potential of working together in DeFi.\n    \n    https://blog.aura.finance/what-is-balancer\n2. **CowSwap:**\n    - CowSwap plays a crucial role in the evolution of AMMs by focusing on minimizing MEV and optimizing trade execution. Collaborating with CowSwap is an essential strategy for Balancer, with the potential to propel Balancer to the forefront of AMM innovation with a successful new product. Over the past few months, we have worked closely with the CowSwap team to create educational material regarding LVR (Loss Versus Rebalancing) mitigation strategies for AMMs as well as to develop a Go-To-Market campaign for the upcoming launch of CoW AMM on Balancer.\n    \n    https://x.com/Balancer/status/1793264880226640373\n\n### Design\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\n\nTo enhance the Balancer brand by creating a cohesive and visually compelling identity that resonates with our target audience, supports our strategic goals, and reinforces Balancer’s position as a leader in DeFi innovation.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. **Brand Development:**\n    - With v3 almost ready for release, we have worked closely with Pon to help evolve the Balancer visual identity for the upcoming  UI release and Z3N rebrand. This collaboration includes the development of a comprehensive brand style guide and asset library to be used across various content verticals, supporting contributors and partners, and ensuring a cohesive and impactful visual presence for Balancer's upcoming initiatives.\n    \n2. **v3 Landing Page:**\n    - As part of the upcoming launch for v3, we have assisted with curating and developing content for the v3 landing page. This effort ensures the page effectively communicates Balancer's core value propositions and embodies Balancer's distinctive style.\n    \n3. **Visual Content Creation:**\n    - Alongside the v3 launch, we have consistently supported marketing-related content with visual imagery. This effort complements the broader marketing strategy and helps to explain content in a more visually engaging way.\n\n \n![image.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicoowhteavye2iknmgmzad3q2nre64dmmi7vrcryj7xbxzmkcxhqy)\n    \n\n\n### v3\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nAs we finalize and prepare to release the v3 codebase, the launch of Balancer v3 presents a prime opportunity to reassert our leadership in AMM innovation. Our primary objective is to present Balancer v3 in the most favorable light, offering thorough education on its key features, executing a comprehensive marketing campaign, and ensuring alignment with business development, design, and strategic partnerships.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n1. v**3 strategy** \n- Our primary objective has been to ensure that all key elements behind Balancer v3 are aligned for maximum effectiveness. This includes defining [Balancer’s value proposition](https://www.notion.so/bfca24480c4f4470ac70b1d5ebba9fff?pvs=21) for developers building custom AMMs, creating a framework for developer onboarding, and prioritizing critical focus areas. Key initiatives included crafting a compelling landing page with marketing and Pon, developing an informative pitch deck with Lipman, and formulating custom AMM liquidity strategies by Mike B and Tritium. By synchronizing these efforts, we aim to showcase Balancer v3’s unique strengths and drive its successful launch and adoption.\n\n![plan.jpg](ipfs://bafybeicmbobqirvldd5k277huy4btcsgkyp7ksvdyxy5xlnn4pxl6gpwre)\n    \n1. **Go-to-Market (G2M) Strategy:**\n- Our Go-to-Market (G2M) strategy for the v3 launch has been coordinated to build anticipation and ensure a smooth rollout. This includes a phased approach beginning with the release of Fernando's vision article and the codebase reveal, followed by the unveiling of the new UI and Zen rebrand. The strategy will leverage deep dive articles, press releases, partnerships, and teaser campaigns to maximize engagement. We will work closely with key partners like Gyroscope, CowSwap, and Aura to help amplify our efforts. Additionally, our design team is working to ensure all visual elements are cohesive and compelling, further highlighting Balancer v3’s innovative features. This G2M plan aims to effectively showcase Balancer v3's features and foster a successful market entry.\n1. **Content Creation:**\n    - Our content creation strategy for Balancer v3 is focused on developing a series of comprehensive educational materials that will guide users and developers through the new capabilities of v3. This includes a range of articles, tutorials, and explainer videos designed to provide in-depth understanding and practical insights into Balancer v3’s functionalities.  By leveraging a mix of written and visual content, we strive to make the learning process engaging and accessible for all users, with the aim to drive adoption and engagement for Balancer v3.\n    \n2. **Key Partnerships:**\n    - Collaborating with strategic partners is essential to promoting Balancer v3. We are working closely with projects like Aura, CowSwap, and Gyroscope to ensure seamless integration and co-develop promotional strategies that highlight the synergies between our technologies. Looking ahead, we also plan to collaborate on future projects like QuantAMM and host events such as AMAs to showcase the advantages of v3 and its integration with partner technologies.\n\n### Future Goals\n\n---\n\n**Objective:**\nTo continue driving innovation and growth within the Balancer ecosystem through strategic educational initiatives, creative design projects, strengthened partnerships, in-depth content creation, and live events.\n\n**Focus:**\n\n**1. Balancer University:**\n\nWe aim to establish a comprehensive educational resource designed to guide new users from a basic understanding to an advanced grasp of Balancer technology. Balancer University will cover a range of topics, including beginner's guides to AMMs, the power of 8020s, Boosted Pools, E-CLPs, and a detailed guide on entering the Balancer ecosystem. Additionally, we will develop and deliver tutorials covering various aspects of Balancer, from basic functionalities to advanced custom AMM strategies, ensuring users are well-equipped to navigate and leverage the platform's full potential.\n\n**2. Creative Design Initiatives:**\n\nOur goal is to produce high-quality visuals and infographics that explain complex concepts and highlight the key features of Balancer v3. These visuals will focus on areas such as the AMM design space on Balancer, the broader Balancer ecosystem, hooks, CoW AMM, and comparisons of AMM development on Balancer versus other platforms. \n\n**3. Partnership Focus for v3:**\n\nBuilding and strengthening strategic partnerships is crucial for mutual growth. We plan to forge new relationships and reinforce existing ones with projects like Gyroscope, CowSwap, QuantAMM and Aura. These collaborations will include joint marketing campaigns, co-branded events, and collaborative product development. \n\n**4. Deep Dive Articles:**\n\nWe will publish a series of in-depth articles that explore the technical and economic aspects of Balancer v3. These articles will highlight real-world use cases, success stories, and innovative applications built on Balancer. By providing thought leadership content on the future of DeFi, liquidity provision, and AMM advancements, we aim to position Balancer as a leading voice in the industry.\n\n**5. Community Engagement:**\n\nFostering a vibrant and engaged community is essential for our continued success. We plan to achieve this through interactive initiatives and continuous engagement. We have begun to seed a culture based around the Balancer Buffalos and plan to expand on this foundation in the near future. \n\n**6. Live Events:**\nParticipating in industry conferences and events is a key strategy for showcasing Balancer’s innovations and expanding our reach. These events improve brand visibility, establish thought leadership, and offer unique opportunities for networking and community engagement. For the launch of Balancer v3, attending live events will demonstrate our new features, build strategic partnerships, and deepen community connections through workshops, hackathons, and social meet-ups.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n---\n\nAs we approach the completion and release of Balancer v3, we are poised for a transformative period that will redefine our position in AMM innovation. While v3 is on the horizon and will receive significant focus, we remain dedicated to the ongoing development and progression of v2. Our marketing efforts will continue to coordinate closely with the Maxis, BD, and Design teams to ensure comprehensive coverage and support for all initiatives, ensuring Balancer’s continued success across both platforms. \n\n### Length of Engagement & Budget\n\n---\n\nWe are requesting an extension of the current funding outlined in BIP-519, amounting to $30K USDC per month, for marketing-related services from July 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\nThe requested funds will exclusively cover contributor salaries. Our team consists of 2 full-time contributors, Jedi and Naly, who manage marketing strategy, content curation, and social media. Additionally, part-time contributions are provided by Vee (brand development and design) and Josey (social science studies and related content).\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

        "body": "### PR with Payloads\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/882\n\n## Service Provider Name\n\nWonderland (defi.sucks)\n\n## Overview\n\nWe're a group of developers, researchers, and data scientists with one thing in common: we all love building cool sh*t. [DeFi sucks](https://defi.sucks/), but we are here to make it better.\n\nOur mission is to discover, partner with, and empower innovators to create open, permissionless, decentralized financial solutions. We pledge to stand by our partners, working with and supporting them in every way possible.\n\nWe’re partners with some of the most relevant and successful protocols in web3, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext, Yearn, Reflexer, and more.\n\nWe think of Balancer as the leader in AMM innovation, with a history of building features that many other protocols adapt later down the road.\n\n## Leader(s)\n\nWonderland comprises a team of 30+ experienced developers and researchers, with [Matias Nisenson](https://twitter.com/MatiasNisenson) as CEO and [0xGorilla](https://twitter.com/0xGorillaDev) as CTO. Find the whole team here: https://defi.sucks/squad\n\n## **Adhere to [[BIP-372]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009) and the SP standards:**\n\nYes\n\n## **Domains of Operation:**\n\nWonderland is a proficient web3-first development team with a lot of experience in cross-chain, automation, oracles, and DeFi, with a strong focus on smart contracts, front ends, and system design. We’re the team behind:\n\n- [Connext optimistic roots](https://github.com/connext?q=&type=all&language=&sort=): saving gas costs by 90% on the merkle tree.\n- [xERC20](https://github.com/defi-wonderland/xERC20): a standard for bridged tokens.\n- [Keep3r Network redesign](https://github.com/keep3r-network/keep3r-network-v2): we helped completely remove liquidity management devops costs.\n- [Hai Stablecoin](https://github.com/hai-on-op): the money-god mandate is to be everywhere, so we made a highly complex protocol as developer-friendly as possible for others to build on top of it and fork it.\n- [Price](https://github.com/price-oracle): a permissionless and reliable oracle that provides safe token price quotes, showcasing what can be built on AMMs.\n\nOur initial focus is on smart contract development for v3. We’ll bring every bit of the experience above to the table, helping Balancer lower its gas consumption and maintenance costs while having the best developer experience possible for those building on top of v3.\n\nWe understand Balancer has a mature ecosystem with multiple service providers and stakeholders committed to its success; we’d be more than happy to engage and collaborate with any of them in any aspect of the protocol where we can help.\n\n## **Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n**Development of Balancer v3:**\n\nFor the past month, we’ve been working with Balancer Labs, getting to know the codebase and supporting some current developments around the upcoming v3 release. Some of the things we’ve done so far are:\n\n- Optimizing current design for gas efficiency.\n- Researching designs to support emerging token standards like the ERC4626.\n- Improving the test suite to provide a test-oriented approach.\n- Security patterns and helping reduce trust assumptions.\n- Providing feedback on upcoming peripheral products.\n\nWe believe code is art; you want every line to have a *raison d'être*, which can make it more gas-efficient and helps security auditors, or even users, to go through it and have a sense of what’s happening quickly, among other things.\n\n**Balancer as the tip of the spear in innovation:**\n\nWe believe there’s a lot of innovation going on in the AMM space, like with the recent boom of hooks after Uni v4, research around Loss-Versus-Rebalancing, or the increasing relevance of aggregators. This is all in the spirit of having the best and most efficient experience for the liquidity provider and the end-user.\n\nWe want to help Balancer stay at the forefront of innovation and experimentation as a customizable and advanced AMM.\n\nKeep in mind that as our collaboration with Balancer extends over time, our goals will evolve to focus on what's most crucial for the success of the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n## What our current partners have to say\n\n*Don’t trust, verify*. These are quotes from a few of our partners and founders who have worked with us for extended periods and can attest to our quality and commitment.\n\n“*Wonderland was wonderful to work with. They aren't cheap but they do excellent work. They went above and beyond their assignment and even found & fixed a bug in a related system, following our communication guidelines for risk mitigation at every step. 10/10 would recommend*.”\n\n**Ameen, founder @Reflexer**\n\n\"*Wonderland is an incredibly talented technical team that takes a radically different approach to how they work with protocols. They are a close partner & core contributor to the Connext ecosystem, taking a proactive leadership role in not only building, but also helping determine what the future of the network will look like. I strongly recommend them to anyone looking for a high integrity, high quality partner*.\"\n\n**Arjun, founder @ Connext**\n\n“*The Wonderland team has been instrumental in helping us push the design space for Aztec and think better about the types of contracts that can be built on Aztec.  They are knowledgeable, motivated, and efficient in their work.*”\n\n**Joe, founder  @Aztec**\n\n\"*Great working together, if I could, I would have them run the protocol full time, complete trust*”\n\n**Andre Cronje**\n\n“*I always enjoy collaborating with Wonderland. They have a wide understanding of the defi space, its needs and problems, and they have right skills to solve them. They've developed one of the most widely used plugins for Hardhat and are always willing to help the defi/Ethereum space.*”\n\n**Patricio, founder @Nomic Labs**\n\n## **Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nWe’re proposing a 4-year long engagement, starting March 14, 2024, with the following structure:\n\n- $30,000/month in USDC.\n- An allocation of 275,000 BAL tokens vested linearly over four years starting February 14.\n- A call option with no expiry for 175,000 BAL with a 30-day TWAP strike price at the time of approval of this proposal, vested linearly over four years.\n- Entity to exercise call options: OpCo / Foundation multi-sig at `0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693`.\n- Specific terms and conditions apply as per real-world contract which will be drafted by the foundation.\n- Quarterly updates under this thread for the duration of the engagement.\n\nThere will be a team of 4 full time developers working on Balancer, with additional support from Wonderland’s research team and the rest of the company.\n\nSince our main expertise lies in code, that's where we shine brightest. However, our incentives are perfectly aligned, and we're fully committed to supporting in every way possible, including business development, communications, or security, whenever we have the capacity and it aligns with our capabilities. Rest assured, we're about going the extra mile for our partners, always ready to contribute beyond our core if we can.\n\n**Termination terms**\n\nBoth parties may terminate this agreement at any time effective immediately upon 15-days prior written notice to the other party due to any failure of either party’s obligations under what’s stated in this proposal. In this case, Wonderland would receive a partial payout of the monthly USDC transfer, and the DAO would execute a clawback on the BAL vested, starting from the effective date of termination.\n\n## **ETH Address to Receive Funds:**\n\n0x74fea3fb0ed030e9228026e7f413d66186d3d107\n\n## **Link to SLA (if going through the Foundation/Opco):**\nN/A.\n\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\n### Monthly USDC Transfer\n\n**Description:** The Balancer DAO will do a monthly 30k USDC transfer to Wonderland.\n\n**Transactions:**\n\n```\nto: 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48 (USDC)\nfunction: transfer(address to, uint256 value)\nargs:\n\tto: 0x74fea3fb0ed030e9228026e7f413d66186d3d107 (Wonderland)\n\tvalue: 30000000000 (30,000e6)\n```\n\n### BAL Vesting\n\n**Description:** The Balancer DAO will create a 4 year vesting of 275k BAL to Wonderland using Yearn's Vesting Escrow.\n\n**Transactions:**\n\n- First tx: Approve tokens to the Yearn Vesting Escrow Factory\n    ```\n    to: 0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d (BAL)\n    function: approve(address spender, uint256 amount)\n    args:\n    \tspender: 0x200C92Dd85730872Ab6A1e7d5E40A067066257cF (Yearn Vesting Escrow Factory)\n    \tamount: 275000000000000000000000 (275,000e18)\n    ```\n    \n- Second tx: Deploy Vesting Contract\n    \n    ```\n    to: 0x200C92Dd85730872Ab6A1e7d5E40A067066257cF (Yearn Vesting Escrow Factory)\n    function: deploy_vesting_contract(address token, address recipient, uint256 amount, uint256 vesting_duration, uint256 vesting_start, uint256 cliff_length, bool open_claim, uint256 support_vyper)\n    args:\n    \ttoken: 0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d (BAL)\n    \trecipient: 0x74fea3fb0ed030e9228026e7f413d66186d3d107 (Wonderland)\n    \tamount: 275000000000000000000000 (275,000e18)\n    \tvesting_duration: 126144000 (4 years)\n    \tvesting_start: 1707868800 (February 14th, 2024)\n    \tcliff_length: 0\n    \topen_claim: 0 (Only Wonderland can trigger the claim)\n    \tsupport_vyper: 0\n    ```\n**Transaction for claw back execution:**\n\n```yaml\nto: <Address of the deployed vesting contract>\nfunction: revoke()\n```\n**Tenderly Simulation:** https://dashboard.tenderly.co/explorer/fork/e8ea44be-0261-4e2b-8a5f-994c023f81b1/transactions\n\n### BAL Call Option\nThe call option is a real-world contract which will be drafted by the foundation.",

    "summary": "The proposal requests support for the DUCATA initiative to join Balancer's Partnership Program with a licensing fee to use Balancer V2 code, aiming to provide protocol-owned liquidity and promote financial innovation. Forum sentiment shows cautious optimism with some calls for clearer terms. Historical similar proposals that passed also aimed to fund development and operations, contributing positively despite minor market dips. Market impacts show some price and TVL decline post-event, which should be carefully considered. Overall, the timeline metrics and vote progression strongly favor the proposal, supporting a positive decision to change.",
