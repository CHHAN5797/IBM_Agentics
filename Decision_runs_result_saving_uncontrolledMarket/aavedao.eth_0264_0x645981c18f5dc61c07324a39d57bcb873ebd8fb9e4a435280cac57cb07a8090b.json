This deployment aims to enhance the growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities, providing new opportunities for both ecosystems.\n\n## **Motivation**:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain presents potential benefits for both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and potential additional revenue. In return, BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**:\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with the following assets for collateral: CAKE, BNB, BTCB, WETH, USDC, and USDT. The table below provides the suggested risk parameters for each asset.\n\n|Risk Parameter|CAKE|BNB|BTCB|WETH|USDC|USDT|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|YES|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|NO|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|NO|NO|NO|NO|YES|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|YES|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|55.00%|70.00%|70.00%|80.00%|77.50%|75.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|61.00%|75.00%|75.00%|82.50%|80.00%|80.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|5.00%|5.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|20.00%|20.00%|15.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,800,000|42,000|115|3,300.00|20,000,000*|20,000,000*|\n|Supply Cap|5,300,000|46,000|210|6,000.00|50,000,000*|50,000,000*|\n|Debt Ceiling|$10,000,000|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|\n|Stable Borrowing|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|NO|\n|uOptimal|45%|45%|45%|80%|90%|80%|\n|Base|0%|0%|0%|1%|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|7%|7%|3.80%|4%|4%|\n|Slope2|300%|300%|300%|80%|60%|75%|\n\n## **Deployment Checklist:**\n\n- Risk service providers feedback ✔\n- BGD Labs [Infrastructure/technical evaluation Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bnb-chain-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/13752)  ✔ \n- Oracle recommendation ✔ ([Chainlink](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=bnb-chain))\n- The graph support ✔\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance  ✔ \n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~70$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Integrate BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 BNB.\n\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "Author: [@Michigan_Blockchain](https://governance.aave.com/u/michigan_blockchain) - Michigan Blockchain, [@Isha](https://governance.aave.com/u/isha) - Isha Varshney (Celo Foundation)\n\nDate: 2023-08-14\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check aims to provide general background information on the Celo blockchain and seeks the community’s input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Celo, an emerging [L2 on Ethereum 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109).\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs detailed in the Background section below, the Celo ecosystem offers a unique value proposition featuring real-world usage and ReFi. As Aave will be given a prominent role on Celo, this deployment offers Aave differentiated expansion and revenue opportunities.\n\n1. A deployment on Celo expands AAVE’s utility and user base to a unique population of Celo’s mobile-first community which has [grown significantly](https://dune.com/springzhang/celo-blockchain-overview) over the past few months led by key launches that have brought in returning real-world users in emerging markets.\n2. Aave will be heavily utilized for real-world DeFi and ReFi use cases, particularly in emerging markets given Celo’s growing presence in these regions led by protocols like GoodDollar and Grassroots Economics.\n3. **The Celo Foundation will allocated 0.5% of CELO circulating supply as an incentive for Aave users to support the adoption and bootstrap growth on Celo.** This deployment will bring new users to the Aave platform and reach more users from the Celo community. The Celo Foundation can also support Aave DAO in setting up a verified node for the Celo network (subject to technical requirements being met and voting by the community) for which Celo can provide a grant.\n4. The [Mento protocol](https://www.mento.org/) on Celo proposed returning 120M CELO to the Celo Community Fund, which the Celo community has expressed interest in placing in Aave to boost on-chain liquidity for CELO (pending a governance process). More details [here](https://forum.celo.org/t/mento-reserve-returning-celo/5236). Additionally, they proposed a $10M CELO / wETH pool on Uniswap which is expected to pass through Celo governance.\n5. In the long-term, this Celo x AAVE deployment has the potential opportunity to expand into natural capital-backed assets such as tokenized carbon credit and other ReFi assets (conditional upon rigorous liquidity and credit assessments by Chaos Labs and others).\n\n## Background\n\nCelo is an open-source, mobile-first EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain, on a mission to foster an inclusive financial system for everyone. With an ecosystem thriving on [9.4M addresses, around 1M daily transactions](https://celoscan.io/)[~500,000 monthly active wallets](https://explorer.celo.org/mainnet/stats),[and over 234M transactions](https://celoscan.io/) since inception, Celo sets the stage for real-world applications from day one. Celo has been one of the fastest-growing blockchains over the past few months.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiba5l3pstp4vgvs5b5brdkg3omz6w5otp7gepzh5ycqdxrspbxv6m)\n\n**Source: Nansen**\n\n### **Key Features:**\n\n**Mobile Accessibility**: Utilizes a decentralized phone verification protocol and SNARK-based light clients such as Plumo 1 for mobile-friendly operations.\n\n**Flexible Assets**: Celo offers native stablecoins in the form of Mento stable assets (cUSD, cEUR, cREAL), which are eligible for transaction fees. CELO itself natively supports the ERC20 interface, eliminating the need for wrapped versions.\n\n**Regenerative Finance**: Committed to regenerative finance, Celo is carbon-negative, offsetting over eight times its carbon footprint. An upcoming proposal, the [Ultragreen Money](https://www.ultragreen.money/), looks to further push Celo’s green initiatives.\n\n**Real World Usage:** CELO TVL continues to grow and is at [193M CELO](https://defillama.com/chain/Celo?currency=CELO) showing continued locking of assets into Celo DeFi protocols. Additionally, Celo has been chosen by [Kickstarter](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/kickstarter-to-start-blockchain-based-crowdfunding-project-report/) for its upcoming decentralized product (to date, Kickstarter has successfully supported over [214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats)) and [Deutsche Telekom](https://blog.celo.org/celo-deutsche-telekoms-partnership-strengthens-with-the-global-launch-of-t-challenge-bd102f07b572) which will attract new users to the ecosystem.\n\nThe Celo ecosystem emphasizes real-world applications—real-world usage has been the core focus since day 1 of the blockchain. Several of the many solutions actively being used by people around the world on the Celo blockchain include the following:\n\n- UBI: GoodDollar has over [130,000 monthly beneficiaries 1](https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/celo?period=month) around the world.\n- Community Currency: Grassroots Economics has [over 20,000 active users](https://viz.sarafu.network/) across Kenya and South Africa\n- Digital Microwork: The Celo Foundation initially piloted digital microwork with [Mercy Corps Ventures](https://www.mercycorps.org/research-resources/potential-cryptocurrency-kenya-youth) and today Jumptask has over [40,000 users](https://celoscan.io/token/0x1d18d0386f51ab03e7e84e71bda1681eba865f1f) on Celo\n- Climate action: [Plastiks](https://plastiks.io/) recently partnered with FC Barcelona on a [climate-focused NFT launch](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/club/news/3505122/fc-barcelona-launches-its-first-nft-collection-in-association-with-plastiks) and [Ecosapiens](https://www.ecosapiens.xyz/) debuted their new [enterprise climate collectible](https://nftnow.com/news/exclusive-ecosapiens-debuts-corporate-climate-collectibles-on-celo/) on Celo. [Toucan](https://toucan.earth/) protocol, [Carbonpath](https://www.carbonpath.io/), and [CarbonTerra](https://carbonterra.com/) offer on chain carbon credit retirements. Additionally, the [Climate Collective](https://climatecollective.org/) continues to remain a leader in the industry driving web3 solutions for solving the climate crisis.\n- Real-world lending: [EthicHub](https://www.ethichub.com/en/) supports 21 smallholder farming communities in Mexico, Brazil, and Honduras for uncollateralized lending. The [Credit Collective](https://forum.celo.org/t/credit-collective-hello-world/5789) is currently seeding liquidity into new impact-driven lending and RWA protocols on Celo with members including [impactMarket 1](https://www.impactmarket.com/), [Flowcarbon](https://www.flowcarbon.com/), [Huma Finance 1](https://huma.finance/), and [Canza Finance](https://canza.io/).\n- Native mobile offramps: Through [FiatConnect 1](https://fiatconnect.org/), an API standard for web3 wallets to integrate with cash-in/cash-out providers, Celo users will be able to natively onramp and offramp through mobile wallets. In its initial activation, [Valora](https://valoraapp.com/) wallet users across 20 countries can now leverage this technology.\n- Social impact and mobile gaming: The Celo Foundation partnered with [Animoca](https://www.animocabrands.com/animoca-brands-joins-celo-ecosystem-to-accelerate-web3-adoption) on mobile-first and social impact gaming. Engagements include Animoca serving as a validator and [climate education](https://twitter.com/TinyTapAB/status/1684485236200026112) with [TinyTap](https://www.start.tinytap.com/publisher-nft).\n\n**Integration with Ethereum**: cLabs recently [proposed 3](https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109) that Celo return home to Ethereum by transitioning from an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain to an Ethereum Layer 2. Following months of research by the cLabs team as well as initial discussions among core Celo and Ethereum community members, the cLabs team detailed an architecture in which the Celo blockchain becomes an Ethereum L2, with key differentiators including\n\n- Decentralized sequencer powered by Celo’s existing validator set running Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus.\n- Off-chain data availability layer, powered by EigenLayer and EigenDA, operated by Ethereum node operators, and protected by restaked ETH. EigenDA brings the design of danksharding to Ethereum early, enabling Celo to maintain its low fees.\n- A design that retains Celo’s 1-block finality.\n\nThis proposal was [overwhelmingly approved](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/116) by the Celo ecosystem in a temperature check to continue this work.\n\n**Security**: The chain consensus is Proof of Stake with validators taking delegation. There is no multisignature contract that can change the network. On-chain governance proposals and hard-forks are the only ways to make changes to the network. The Smart Contract was audited by [OpenZeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/celo-contracts-audit/) and a Security Audit was conducted by [Trailofbits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PEjoN_wn--OWwzOcolAUGimBjqFjEecNSSQwL6i0y3Q/edit). There is also a formal verification of Celo governance protocols by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CeloMay2020.pdf).\n\n**Native Mobile Solutions**: [FiatConnect 1](https://fiatconnect.org/) allows Celo users to natively handle onramps and offramps through mobile wallets in multiple countries.\n\nEmphasizing global utility, Celo has been a touchstone for decentralized solutions worldwide. From UBI, community currencies, and digital microwork, to climate action, Celo propels web3 solutions with a real-world impact.\n\nFor a detailed dive, head over to https://docs.celo.org/.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Risk Parameters\n\nChaos Labs advised us on initial parameter recommendations, given the current liquidity levels on Celo. **Please note that these recommendations would be updated closer to launch.** We encourage other risk managers for updated analyses post temperature check. Crucially, the metrics below **do not** include a [governance proposal 1](https://celo.stake.id/#/proposal/121) in which $10M of liquidity is proposed by the Celo ecosystem for a CELO / wETH pool on Uniswap.\n\nBased on current liquidity levels, **we believe a Metis-type of initial deployment would be most suitable—the emphasis here being the Celo blockchain’s real-world and social impact use cases**. Over time, we expect we can continue to increase caps as the Celo blockchain grows through the development of more real-world use cases and the transition to an L2 on Ethereum.\n\n| Risk Parameters | WETH | USDC | CELO | cUSD |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | YES |\n| Enable Borrow | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | NO | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 75% | N/A | 70% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 80% | N/A | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% | 5% | N/A | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 10% | 15% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | 110 | 880,000 | 60,000 | 3,400,000 |\n| Supply Cap | 140 | 1,100,000 | 80,000 | 4,300,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | TBD |\n| uOptimal | 80% | 80% | 45% | 75% |\n| Base | 1% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 3.8% | 4% | 7% | 7% |\n| Slope2 | 80% | 60% | 300% | 75% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled | Disabled |\n| Stable Slope1 | 13.00% | 13.00% | 13.00% | 13.00% |\n| Stable Slope2 | 300.00% | 300.00% | 300.00% | 300.00% |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset | 3.00% | 3.00% | 3.00% | 3.00% |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset | 5.00% | 5.00% | 5.00% | 5.00% |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio | 20.00% | 20.00% | 20.00% | 20.00% |\n| Flashloanable | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Siloed Borrowing | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | NO | YES | NO | NO |\n\n**Oracle:** Chainlink recently deployed on Celo as part of the Chainlink SCALE Program.\n\n**Cross-chain Interactions**: Celo has integrations with token bridges like [Portal (Wormhole)](https://www.portalbridge.com/#/transfer), [Allbridge](https://allbridge.io/classic/), and [Squid](https://www.squidrouter.com/)–along with cross-chain messaging partners including [Wormhole](https://wormholenetwork.com/), [Hyperlane](https://www.hyperlane.xyz/), [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/), and [Axelar](https://axelar.network/).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe information provided above about Celo is from public sources and Michigan Blockchain cannot guarantee that it is or will stay accurate.\n\nThe Celo Foundation has been collaborating with Michigan Blockchain to work through the details of this proposed deployment and communicate the merits to the broader Aave community.

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Aave V3 Deployment on GnosisChain\nAuthor: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\nDate: 2023-08-31\n---\n\n## **Summary**:\n\nThis ARFC proposes the deployment of Aave V3 on the GnosisChain. Following the positive feedback from the TEMP CHECK, the assets considered for this deployment include wETH, wstETH, GNO, USDC, wxDAI, and EURe.\n\n## **Motivation**:\n\nThe GnosisChain, with its historical significance in the ecosystem and its roots in the POA network, presents a valuable opportunity for Aave. The friendly fork RMM Market with RealT on the GnosisChain has already showcased the potential synergies between Aave's codebase and GnosisChain. This ARFC seeks to further these synergies, providing mutual benefits for both ecosystems.\n\n## **Specification**:\n\nThe ARFC suggests deploying Aave V3 on the GnosisChain with the following assets and risk parameters:\n\n| Risk Parameter          | wETH  | wstETH | GNO | USDC | wxDAI | EURe |\n|-------------------------|-------|--------|-----|------|-------|------|\n| Isolation Mode          | NO    | NO     | YES | NO   | NO    | NO   |\n| Borrowable in Isolation           | NO  | NO   | NO  | YES  | YES   | NO  |\n| Stable Borrow         | NO    | NO     | NO | NO   | NO    | NO   |\n| Enable Borrow           | YES   | YES    | NO  | YES  | YES   | YES  |\n| Enable Collateral       | YES   | YES    | YES | YES  | YES   | NO   |\n| Loan To Value           | 80.5% | 71%    | 31% | 77%  | 77%   | N/A  |\n| Liquidation Threshold   | 83%   | 76%    | 36% | 80%  | 80%   | N/A  |\n| Liquidation Bonus       | 6%    | 6%     | 10% | 5% | 5%  | N/A  |\n| Reserve Factor          | 15%   | 15%    | N/A | 10%  | 10%   | 15%  |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee| 10%   | 10%    | 10% | 20%  | 20%   | 10%  |\n| Supply Cap              | 4000 wETH | 4000 wsETH | 30000 | 1M USDC | 1.5M xDAI | 1.5M EURe |\n| Borrow Cap              | 3500 wETH | 400 wstETH | N/A | 1M USDC | 1.5M xDAI | 1.5M EURe |\n| Debt Ceiling            | N/A   | N/A    | 5M$ | N/A  | N/A   | N/A  |\n| uOptimal                | 80%   | 45%    | N/A | 90%  | 90%   | 90%  |\n| Base                    | 0%    | 0%     | N/A | 0%   | 0%    | 0%   |\n| Slope1                  | 3.3%  | 7%   | N/A | 4% | 4%    | 4%   |\n| Slope2                  | 80%   | 300%    | N/A | 75%  | 75%   | 75%  |\n\nFurthermore, we recommend the following parameters for the ETH eMode pool:\n\n|Parameter|ETH eMode Pool|\n| --- | --- |\n|Liquidation Threshold (LT)|93%|\n|Loan-To-Value (LTV)|90%|\n|Liquidation Bonus (LB)|1%|\n\nEven if both assets currently lack the maturity to be considered, the ACI is supportive mid-term of onboarding both wGHO and sDAI onboarding in the GnosisChain V3 pool.\n\n## **Deployment Checklist**:\n\n- Risk service providers feedback ✅\n- GnosisChain [Infrastructure/technical evaluation Report](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-gnosischain-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/14915) ✅\n- Oracle support ✅\n- The graph support ✅\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance ❓\n\n## **Disclaimer**:\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Gnosis or any affiliated entities for creating this ARFC proposal.

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
