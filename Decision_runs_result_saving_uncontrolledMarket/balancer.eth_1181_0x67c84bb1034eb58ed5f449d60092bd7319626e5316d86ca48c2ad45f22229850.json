Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRedacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:**\n\nRedacted’s governance is currently off-chain using [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/redactedcartel.eth). The multisig address is: 0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e. Decisions relating to inflation, liquidity, partnership or DAO treasury go through a DAO vote, and then are executed by the multisig. On-chain governance will come at a later stage.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nLink to all audits can be found [here](https://dineroismoney.com/docs/security).\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n4/7 multisig (0xA52Fd396891E7A74b641a2Cb1A6999Fcf56B077e) controls the pushing of validators public keys to the contract.\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\nThe pxETH/ETH pool has not yet been seeded. As explained above, pxETH has redemption mechanisms which allow the peg to be maintained/ arbitraged. Since launch on 2023/12/13, the main liquidity for pxETH is on Maverick (in anticipation of a gauge on Balancer).\n\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nWith a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xdee29b7b6dF3576280bFBbC088ee9eBAA767C0Bd`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n* The pool shall has a swap fee of 4 basis points, i.e., 0.04% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n# References/Useful links\n\n* [Slidedeck on E-CLPs ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n* [Website ](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github ](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> pxETH is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol. pxETH is built on top of the Redacted DAO’s Pirex platform and forms an integral part of Redacted’s Dinero protocol, a protocol which aims to vertically integrate ETH staking, block proposal and building, a RPC, leverage, and yield stripping into one synergistic ecosystem comprising pxETH, the Redacted Relayer RPC, and the DINERO stablecoin. pxETH provides users with a liquid and fungible tokenized staked ETH which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards.

With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\nBy using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\n* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\nSeveral E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins.

For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n## Oracles\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n## Audits\n\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n## Centralization vectors\n\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n## Market History\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains.

E-CLPs are custom pools from Gyroscope built on top of Balancer’s pool architecture. They enable trading along the curve of an ellipse. This pool type is ideally suited for stablecoins and liquid staking tokens; it is typically more capital efficient and could thus generate significant trading volume.\n* The pool shall has a swap fee of 4 basis points, i.e., 0.04% at pool inception. The fee split is as follows: 50% of all collected fees will go to liquidity providers, while the remaining 50% will go towards Balancer. At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n# References/Useful links\n\n* [Slidedeck on E-CLPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16Qt-8PaLJ_1FkaNnI4rocEYUDrG1ktW3u4R6yeSwY68/edit#slide=id.g208e5b00ffd_0_95)\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps#description-of-e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> pxETH is a liquid and fungible receipt token for ETH deposited into the Dinero protocol. pxETH is built on top of the Redacted DAO's Pirex platform and forms an integral part of Redacted’s Dinero protocol, a protocol which aims to vertically integrate ETH staking, block proposal and building, a RPC, leverage, and yield stripping into one synergistic ecosystem comprising pxETH, the Redacted Relayer RPC, and the DINERO stablecoin. pxETH provides users with a liquid and fungible tokenized staked ETH which benefits from Ethereum staking rewards and other revenue forms such as MEV tips and block rewards. Future pxETH yield and pxETH withdrawals can be tokenized and used within DeFi. Further details about pxETH can be found in the whitepaper [here](https://github.com/redacted-cartel/pirex-eth-whitepaper/blob/master/pxETH_whitepaper.pdf).\n\nIn addition to the DEX liquidity for pxETH incentivized by Redacted DAO, the Dinero protocol has additional mechanisms to improve pxETH liquidity and support the pxETH:ETH peg in both normal and adverse market conditions allowing for greater pxETH DeFi composability.\n\npxETH can be redeemed for ETH from the Dinero protocol either instantaneously for ETH which has yet to be staked or via ETH which is unstaked from validators. In the future a novel incentivized withdrawal pool will facilitate quicker pxETH withdrawals when there is an ETH unstaking queue and/or adverse market conditions.\n\nThe governance token for pxETH is BTRFLY.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Redacted has a long and close relationship with Balancer and Aura. Because of this close relationship and Redacted’s vlAURA governance power, we want to have Balancer as the one of our primary venues for crucial pxETH liquidity.\n\nAn LST is only as good as its peg. Therefore for pxETH to be successful, significant liquidity is required. With a gauge, Redacted plans to use its governance power and bribes to direct emissions to the gauge and incentivize crucial pxETH liquidity on Balancer, allowing for higher volumes in the LP and also generating fees for veBAL holders.\n\nBy using E-CLPs a comparably small amount of initial capital can provide a disproportionately deep market for GYD. The E-CLP’s efficiency gains are possible due to:\n\n* Customizable liquidity profiles: Using the curve of an ellipse enables highly customizable liquidity profiles. E-CLPs can be calibrated to approximate most trading curves that would be desired. E-CLP curves can be tailored to have certain regions of low price impact and other regions of high price impact.\n\n* Price bounds: The E-CLP concentrates liquidity within price-bounds that enable the E-CLP to be highly capital-efficient. Functionally, this works by enabling arbitrary truncation of liquidity profiles from a given trading curve. In effect, the capital efficiency comes from bounding the trading curve to an expected trading range of the assets.\n\nSeveral E-CLPs have already been deployed to provide custom tailored liquidity profiles for LSTs and stablecoins. For an overview of previously deployed E-CLPs consult: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps 1\n\n# Specifications\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n## Oracles\n\nNo oracles are currently used.\n\n## Audits\n\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n## Centralization vectors\n\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n## Market History\n\nThe Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available[ here 1](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n\n## Value\n\nAs per “Motivation”.\n\n## Contracts\n\n* [pxETH/frxETH E-CLP](https://etherscan.io/address/0x767cb26e38bebddfd857d4ad426d8ff5bc0fac2f)\n* Ethereum [gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x21693d09df79D4297A1ED9622Fb1D2E4Eeec5BC5)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x21693d09df79D4297A1ED9622Fb1D2E4Eeec5BC5`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

We plan to provide bribe incentives to veBAL holders once the gauge is active, which will bring in both TVL & trading volumes for the balancer/beets.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n* Governance: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n  * Current governance structure: https://docs.ib.xyz/governance\n  * Admin multisig: https://gnosis-safe.io/app/oeth:0xfB9423283EB7F65210B9aB545ecC212B5AE52b3A/\n\n* Oracles: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n  * Yes - https://docs.ib.xyz/lending-market/price-oracle\n\n* Audits: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n  * The audit is done by MixBytes and can be found here https://github.com/mixbytes/audits_public/tree/master/Iron%20Bank\n* Centralization vectors: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n  * On IB Optimism, treasury functions and smart contract proxy updates are controlled through a 3/5 multisig\n\n* Market History: Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool’s gauge.\n  * The pool has been active since 9/2, 2022 and we’ve directed IB emission to bootstrap the liquidity of this pool.\n  * Currently it has $162K TVL generating over $27K in volume\n  * Link to the pool: https://op.beets.fi/pool/0x785f08fb77ec934c01736e30546f87b4daccbe50000200000000000000000041\n  * Link to the capped gauge: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78F50cF01a2Fd78f04da1D9ACF14a51487eC0347#code\n\n* Value: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n  * Yes, this is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for IB.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/402\n\n**Summary:**\n\nEnable gauge for a boosted MAI-DOLA LP on Arbitrum. MAI to be boosted via Aave V3.\n\n**Protocol Descriptions:**\n\nMAI\n\nMAI is the most crosschain decentralized stablecoin. It is overcollateralized by decentralized collaterals. A detailed list of collaterals and risk profiles can be found here. \n\nMAI has a long history of supporting Balancer, through collateral integrations and direct emissions. MAI is currently incentivizing Aura voting for MAI-GHO on Ethereum with WETH.\n\nDOLA\n\nDOLA is a CDP stablecoin based primarily on Ethereum. It has a long track record in DeFi and a strong player in the L2 liquidity mining space.\n\n**Motivation**:\n\nWith the decline of certain DEXs on Arbitrum, both DOLA and MAI are looking for consistent liquidity base on Arbitrum. Both projects have committed to incentivizing the voting for this gauge with voting incentives. MAI will directly use protocol revenue from Arbitrum (denominated in WETH) for this purpose.\n\n**Specifications**:\n\n**Governance**: Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.\n\nBoth protocols are DAOs and are governed by their communities.\n\n**Oracles**: Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\nBoth protocols use Chainlink oracles for pricing collaterals.\n\n**Audits**: Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\nMAI: The protocol has been audited twice. Audits can be found here: https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security\n\nDOLA: Seen the audit for DOLA here: https://docs.inverse.finance/inverse-finance/technical/audits\n\n**Centralization vectors**: Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\nMAI: The protocol runs on decentralized systems such as competitive liquidations, and vote-based collateral onboarding. No single person has admin controls over the protocol. The treasury and some part of the protocol are secured by a multisig of doxxed team members. The Aave Guardians standard is currently being implemented at QiDao, with full implementation expected by the end of August.\n\nDOLA: The protocol runs on a decentralized infrastructure, as it is a community-run DAO. Multisigs used within DOLA are disclosed on their site and their holdings are listed.\n\n**Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool’s gauge.\n\nMAI and DOLA have existed for several years, being some of the earliest decentralized stablecoins that are still active. Both stablecoins have experienced short periods of volatility in the past, but have been able to recover promptly.\n\n**Value**: Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\nThis pool will add to Balancer’s market growth within Arbitrum. MAI and DOLA are popular stablecoins in the L2 space and therefore can bring significant activity,\n\nThis move will also increase the amount of voting incentives being received by Balancer DAO.\n\nLink to pool: [0xA50f89e9f439Fde2a6Fe05883721a00475da3C45](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xa50f89e9f439fde2a6fe05883721a00475da3c45#code)\nLink to gauge: [0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72#readContract)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xa06893ee34F65039a7153A824A1eF399933cBB72`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
