With a TVL of approximately $5 billion, BNB Chain is the third-largest chain by TVL. The chain has a diverse array of DeFi offerings, including prominent projects like PancakeSwap, Venus, and several others. Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain has the potential to benefit both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and the potential for additional revenue. BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. Suggested risk parameters for each asset are provided in the table below. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\n| Risk Parameter | BNB | WBTC | BETH | WETH | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 65% | 70% | 60% | 80% | 82.5% | 70% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 75% | 70% | 82.5% | 85% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10% | 10% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 8.5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 15% | 15% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | N/A | 80.000 | 20,000,000 | 20.000.000 |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 | 5,000 | 20,000 | 100,000 | 50,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 75% | 45% | 45% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 6.1% | 7% | 7% | 4.8% | 4% | 4% |\n| Slope2 | 100% | 300% | 300% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~75$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nTemperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain.\n\nARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\nAIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] - Aave V1 Offboarding Plan\n\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative\n\nDate: 2023-03-17\n\n## **Simple Summary**\n\nThis Temperature Check proposes the offboarding of Aave V1 by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on the platform, encouraging users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3.\n\n## **Background**\n\nAave V1 has been frozen since December 2022, and users have been given ample time to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3. As sufficient time has passed, it is now appropriate to move forward with the offboarding process for Aave V1.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAave V1 has served as a pioneering platform in the DeFi ecosystem. However, with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is essential to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. By offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions, we can ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1.\n\n### **New Rate Strategies**\n\nFor each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented:\n\n1. uOptimal: 20%\n2. reserveFactor: 99.9%\n3. base rate: 3%\n4. slope 1: 7%\n5. slope 2: 200%\n\nThese changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to the newer platforms.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal.\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion and finalization of the proposal.\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

The timeline vote analysis shows strong early and consistent support for keeping the $ARB, with a stable lead and no significant vote shifts.
