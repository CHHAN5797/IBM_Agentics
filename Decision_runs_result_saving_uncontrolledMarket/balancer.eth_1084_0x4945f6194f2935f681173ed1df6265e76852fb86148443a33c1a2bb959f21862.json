The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Base: 0x99aC4484e8a1dbd6A185380B3A811913Ac884D87\n\nsDAI / aUSDC Base pool on Gyro: https://app.gyro.finance/pools/base/e-clp/0x821afe819450a359e29a5209c48f2fa3321c8ad2/\n\nChild chain gauge: [https://basescan.org/address/0x6A3F93bB18fbdDea76169D3D94d03371E9e0DdC4#code]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1\n\ngaugeType(string): Base",

As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.\n> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implements the agreed-upon changes to the platform.

As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.\n> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system.

USD.AI is backed by T-bills from M^0 and from loans issued against hardware (at first it will be GPUs). \n\nThe protocol’s architecture combines delta-neutral strategies with on-chain Treasury Bill exposure, creating a synthetic dollar that maintains price stability while producing sustainable yield. This dual approach ensures that USD.AI remains pegged to $1 through arbitrage mechanisms and dynamic rebalancing, even under volatile market conditions.\n\nUSD.AI is fully non-custodial and transparent, leveraging smart contracts to manage collateral, yield generation, and redemptions. Additionally, it plans to integrate cross-chain capabilities using LayerZero technology, enabling seamless liquidity and composability across multiple blockchain ecosystems.\n\nFor more details, see the [USD.AI Documentation](https://docs.usd.ai/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nDeploying a Balancer v3 Aave Boosted pool for USD.AI/aGHO will significantly enhance capital efficiency and yield opportunities for liquidity providers. The integration of aGHO, which earns native yield from Aave, reduces the overall incentive cost and offers a stacked yield opportunity when paired with USD.AI.\n\nThe new **USD.AI/aGHO** pool will serve as the primary liquidity venue for USD.AI, promoting integrations with DeFi protocols that utilize aGHO. The higher amplification factor in the Composable Stable pool is expected to improve liquidity depth and trading efficiency, benefiting users seeking both yield and low-slippage stable swaps.\n\nA gauge is essential to bootstrap TVL, strengthen liquidity depth, and support broader DeFi integrations for USD.AI, solidifying its role within the evolving RWA-backed stablecoin landscape.\n\n## Specifications\n\n### 1. Governance\n\nUSD.AI operates within the control of the core team at the moment as there is no governance token issued yet.\n\n### 2. Oracles\n\nUSD.AI utilizes the oracle\n\n### 3. Audits\n\nUSD.AI’s smart contracts have undergone multiple security audits to ensure the safety of user funds and protocol operations. Audit reports are publicly available in the [USD.AI Documentation](https://docs.usd.ai/technical-overview/audits).\n\n### 4. Centralization Vectors\n\nUSD.AI is designed to minimize centralization risks. The protocol is fully on-chain and non-custodial, and collateral management occurs transparently via smart contracts. Governance mechanisms and decentralized oracles further reduce the risk of central points of failure.\n\n### 5. Market History\n\nUSD.AI is a newer protocol, with initial traction on Arbitrum and a TVL of approximately $30 million. Integrating USD.AI into Balancer v3 on Arbitrum represents an opportunity to expand its liquidity footprint and establish a prominent position as an RWA-backed stablecoin.\n\n\n\n### 6. Value\n\nThe **USD.AI/aGHO** pool will serve as the main liquidity hub for USD.AI on arbitrum.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Enable Gauges\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\n- Pool address: `0xA8b7683936DfF9E2F35404e61A875A76676a07B6` \n- Child gauge: `0x82FAeb834FDc9F2E3dde36C7d29cEAa2bBE24166`\n- Root gauge: `0xDB7981655Db66Aa9BD489c76323B88bD1545C7aB`\n- GaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "title": "[BIP-595] Enable Gauge for sDAI / aUSDC pool on Optimism",
        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/918\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Optimism, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Optimism: 0x2218a117083f5B482B0bB821d27056Ba9c04b1D3\n\nsDAI/aUSDC Optimism pool on Gyro: [Gyroscope Protocol](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/optimism/e-clp/0x876e0a21626c33bdab879330505eccc6091aa607/)\n\nChild chain gauge: [[Vyper_contract | Address 0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340 | OP Mainnet Etherscan ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340)]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf\n\ngaugeType(string): Optimism",
