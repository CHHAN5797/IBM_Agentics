The final proposal will reflect the discussion on the governance forum.\n\ntitle: ARC - Consolidate Aave V1, V2 & AMM Reserve Factors, Purchase CVX and Deploy to Earn Yield\nauthor: Llama Community @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon \ncreated: 03/01/2022\n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThe Aave V1, V2, and AMM market Reserve Factors (RF) on the Ethereum network hold a combined value of over [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). The Llama Community proposes consolidating the RF into the V2 RF and deploying the capital with the intention of retaining TVL and earning additional yield. The yield generated comes with the added benefit of acquiring governance tokens of other DeFi protocols and increasing Aave’s metagovernance influence.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe Llama Community recommends implementing several yield generating strategies spanning Balancer, Curve, and Convex and subsequently participating in the respective communities' tokenomic constructs. Aave will earn yield in the form of swap fee income, aToken yield derived from Aave V2, and governance token incentives in the form of BAL, CRV, CVX, stkAAVE and LDO.\n\nThe first investment theme is deploying capital into the Balancer Boosted Pool and BTC Stable Pool to earn a vAPY of around 13.4% and 4.6% respectively. The Balancer Boosted Pool invests around 80% or more of the deposited liquidity into Aave V2 to earn yield whilst also generating swap fees, stkAAVE, and BAL rewards. The Stable Pool generates income via swap fees and BAL rewards, with the latter making up the majority of the incentives on both strategies.\n\nThe second investment theme is more complex. It involves acquiring both CVX and veCRV to participate in gauge weight voting on Curve in order to influence a portion of the CRV inflation schedules to be distributed to aToken pool Liquidity Providers (LPs). Aave will deploy stables and ETH from the RF to earn additional CRV and CVX rewards, which will be used to further boost the incentive allocation to the aToken pools.\n\nThe data presented here is accurate as of the end of December 2021 data.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Part A - Consolidation\n\nThe legacy V1 market continues to generate mostly flash loan fee revenue and this has slowed down in recent times. There is only ~[$219M](https://app-v1.aave.com/home) of TVL remaining in the V1 market, and at the rate of which revenue is generated is expected to continue declining as more and more users move to V2 or V3 over time.\n\n![|602x232](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Kqln89Od7cLnxfnd5sEq4gn6xMD2yrAocqa8nJOaXQoyjQ4GlNkgfw8pQ7E2skefYXPdtiqSLwWL_KtYcNiO6Qjciy0I296Q7eiz0R9_NEO1nhZSPJtMqR-eDXg4N7SOqTj-zsEC)\n\nThis proposal recommends consolidating the Aave V1, V2, and AMM market revenue into a single location before deploying the capital to earn additional yield. The V1 RF holds around ~[$821K](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3d9988f676457123c5fd01297605efdd0cba1ae) of assets at the time of writing, whereas the Ethereum V2 + AMM market holds [$27.45M](https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) of assets. Consolidating the RF balance would increase the mainnet treasury to around [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60). A summary of the main assets held in the V1 RF are shown below:\n\n![|602x232](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/947026c5031f95dbb5c76d9939f772d746867d90.png)\n\n## Part B - Retain TVL & Increase Returns\n\nWhilst holding aTokens is arguably one of the lowest risk yield opportunities in DeFi and something Llama Community encourages most, if not all, treasuries to hold. The Aave DAO is fortunate since it receives income in the form of aTokens. Thus, Llama recommends firstly making all unproductive stable coins productive and then optimizing further by earning additional yield and metagovernance influence.\n\nThe two main high level strategies proposed in this ARC share three common goals:\n\n* Retain TVL within Aave\n* Exceed aToken returns\n* Accumulate metagovernance influence\n\nIn addition to these three goals, the Convex / Curve strategies have the added benefit of improving the extrinsic use cases for aTokens. aToken holders will be able to deposit liquidity into the Curve aToken pools and then deposit the Liquidity Provider (LP) token into either Curve or Convex to earn additional yield.\n\nThe Compound pool on Curve has [$174.5M](https://curve.fi/compound/) of TVL relative to the Aave pool which has [$55.3M](https://curve.fi/aave/) of TVL.This is most likely due to the higher incentive APR that the Compound pool, 10.13% vAPY, relative to the Aave pool earning 7.58% vAPY on Convex.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Overview\n\nLlama proposes diversifying $26,67M (94.36%) of the combined Ethereum RFs across three protocols: Convex, Curve and Balancer. The combined Aave V1, AMM, and V2 market RF totals [$28.27M](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) at the time of writing. A detailed breakdown of the consolidated constituents can be found on the [Aave Treasury Finances by Llama Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=60) and a high-level overview is shown in the figure below.\n\n**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bst-8FdWe_RfGSXcDYeItuso4X58wWylaIo06XSnRjax0JJ7UfnjUPM7p-5bGYdu6QrdtGkkUzbzyu5kLe-4a17tLCFY5WD5Wj6gPD7YSuoHfjVfsqNfy2nlM47NQNmZPp7GeQKH \"Chart\")**\n\nThe table below shows the assets that will be deployed within this proposal. Note this is only 94.4% of the assets and 5.6% of the assets are to remain unchanged within the Aave V2 RF.**\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/c/c10a19f49f9edbbd241d7a280d0a0541e2bf9316.png)\n\n\nThe table above includes the following stablecoins, DAI, USDC, USDT, TUSD, BUSD and sUSD from the Aave V1 and V2 markets. The AMM markets holdings have not been included as they only total $119.3K at the time of writing.\n\nThe table below shows asset allocation per each strategy:\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/33eaba04a8080fdd0c5b6496090155a98965bab4.png)\n\nThe balance within the Aave V2 RF, not deployed in one of the above strategies is shown as Other (Longtailed Assets) in the figure below. The percentages reflect the overall composition of the RF, noting that 94.4% of the consolidated RF is deployed into one of the strabled detailed in the above table.\n\n**![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DLtTpPMVMYL0mhKSaCrroYwwD4r3-3uRDgwUjLIeZjrmMwnQ8i7-PSfgrwnHJLJnd5b4GfeTIhVuaW1emtWc12o-YFyQTqgVMOMyPni023sKbTxZFpyneBVCGu_eV3u-UuvOcsLc \"Chart\")**\n\nThe actual implementation of this proposal is likely to be spread across several AIPs. This is to reduce the implementation complexity and allow the several positions to be swapped / redeemed before being deployed into a bonding curve whilst we await the Chainlink CVX oracle being released and getting the Aave V2 RF whitelisted to deposit into the CRV locking contract to attain veCRV.\n\nThe subsequent sections provide further insight into each strategy and how they are to be funded.\n\n## Convex / Curve Strategy\n\n### Convex Allocation\n\nThe Convex (CVX) allocation is to be funded by the assets mentioned in the table below:\n\n**![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/468f451db851df2f8c4ec9f3bc28fd81647492da.png)**\n\nIn order to fund the initial $2M purchase of CVX, all of the AMPL, BUSD and TUSD will be used ($842.2K) and the balance, $1,16M, will be funded with USDC. This is the initial purchase of CVX and with a unit price of $43.20 is equivalent to about 46,300 CVX tokens.\n\nWe expect to make additional CVX purchases in order to meet the minimum voting hurdle required to influence how Convex’s veCRV holding is deployed on Curve gauges. Based upon this [snapshot](https://vote.convexfinance.com/#/proposal/QmRgsaGswSgzuzaiiH385StTGsv5TVdhAA1LWBGWR3yyLp) and the [Voting Rules and Information](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/voting-and-gauge-weights) section of Convex’s documentation, we estimate around 70,000 CVX votes are needed to clear the hurdle rate. This is expected to cost a further $1.02M to what is proposed above and represents less than 1 months revenue. We intend to fund this through future revenue and have a sufficient buffer to the hurdle rate based upon voter participation on Convex’s snapshot.\n\nThe assets are to be converted to ETH and then used to purchase CVX via a Bonding Curve with a 50 bps premium that utilizes a Chainlink oracle price feed. Alternative methods can be discussed in the comments. However, we opt for a solution that can be implemented entirely through the AIP governance process and does not include manual trading.\n\nAMPL is the most illiquid of the mentioned tokens and this position will need to be converted to ETH over a series of transactions. Trades are to be routed through an aggregator with MEV protection like CowSwap. The most liquid AMPL pools are on Uniswap V2 and Sushiswap. Wherever possible, aTokens will be swapped rather than redeemed in an attempt to retain TVL in the Aave V2 market.\n\nThe newly acquired CVX will be locked for 16 weeks with voting rights delegated to Llama in order to vote on both Aave and sAave gauges via Convex’s snapshot to increase the amount of CRV rewards received on the Curve pools. Voting occurs every 2 weeks via Snapshot and thus the need for a delegate.\n\nThe locked CVX also receives a portion of the protocol fee income and votes on how Convex’s veCRV are distributed across Curve’s gauges. Llama Community acting as the delegate will vote to boost CRV rewards on the Aave pool as a priority and sAave once sufficient voting influence has been attained.\n\n### 4 Year Locked Curve (veCRV) Allocation\n\nThe aCRV tokens that have accumulated within Aave V2 are to be redeemed for CRV and then locked for 4 years on Curve to receive an equal amount of veCRV. This strategy is subject to Aave’s V2 RF being approved and whitelisted via Curve’s governance process.\n\n![|602x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/21477469e7d025cafd72614e98c3e6cd4e3236cf.png)\n\nThe veCRV position will then be used to vote for CRV incentives to be allocated to the Aave and sAave pools via the respective gauges. Based on the CVX strategy discussed prior, these veCRV votes are likely to be allocated to the sAave gauge.\n\nSubject to the timeline and attaining the whitelist permission to deposit into Curve’s veCRV contract, the alternative strategy is to convert CRV to cvxCRV, then stake to earn CRV, CVX and 3crv, pulse any airdrops that go to veCRV holders. This is expected to generate 47.35% vAPY, see snippet below.\n\n**![|602x244](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v6jyNfHVIrr7ovNveVCupxypxFTzoZfLAP3_aGSwRHVcNezLxZIPvmmLHitPMI7TzrFRm9G-SRpimpcuJqnZLX-OvJ5SUai1_2jStwPxr02Uyge60q2WDCx0dS4eU4GnwAblDACD)**\n\nThe earned CRV will be converted to cvxCRV and this will compound over time. The earned CVX will be locked to increase Aave’s voting influence and the 3crv will be exchanged for CRV, then converted to cvxCRV to further compound the strategies returns over time.\n\n### Productive aToken Stable Strategy\n\nThe sAave and Aave strategies include depositing capital into a Curve pool and then staking the LP token on Convex to earn stkAAVE, CVX and CRV rewards. The two strategies are expected to generate around 4.07% vAPY and 6.19% vAPY before Aave’s CRV and CVX voting influences the CRV incentive derived yield.\n\nThe table below shows the allocation, how each strategy is funded, and which pool those funds are to be deposited into.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/03ca5c3d9bf70c960c6769e35b6a630d64b6ce18.png)\n\n### Productive ETH Strategy\n\nAfter transferring the ETH from Aave V1 RF to Aave V2 RF, the awETH is to be redeemed for ETH and the combined ETH deposited into the Curve stETH pool. The LP token steCRV is to then be deposited and staked in Convex to earn CRV, CVX and LDO incentives. The expected yield is around 6.65% vAPY.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/3d101f6f395bb1310f0d58031136da366e6ee838.png)\n\nNo vlCVX or veCRV voting rights will be used to attract CRV incentives on this pool as the pool does not contain any aTokens.\n\n## Balancer Strategy\n\n### Balancer Boosted Pool Strategy\n\nBalancer has recently launched the first [Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe?utm_source=website&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=aaveboostedpools) on Wednesday 16th December and liquidity mining incentives have already commenced generating around 13.4% vAPY at the time of writing. Using the [Stable Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42000000000000000000000063) as a guide, we expect Balancer to grow the Boosted Pool with the use of Liquidity Mining (LM) and even replace the Stable Pool in time.\n\nThe Balancer Boosted Pools earn swap fee income, LM incentives, and a new type of yield derived from unproductive capital being deposited into Aave V2 to earn yield. Llama expects the yield of the Boosted pool to exceed the Stable Pool in order to entice users to move across. Llama expects LM incentives to be the mechanism for achieving an elevated return while the pool is in its bootstrapping phase.\n\nThe strategy for Aave is to deposit an equal amount of DAI, USDC and USDT into the Boosted Pool. All BAL rewards are to be retained to accumulate governance influence.\n\n![|602x244](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/57b902e46f625cfea122142b56fd0d0ccbe75579.png)\n\nPost is to long.\n\nsee: https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token\nstatus: WIP\nauthor: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham\ncreated: 21-03-2022\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nAcquire 200,000 BAL tokens via a combination of performing a BAL for AAVE token swap. The BAL tokens are to be complemented with ETH and deposited into the 80/20 BAL/ETH pool. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year. The veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nPerform a token swap with Balancer by exchanging AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve for 200,000 BAL tokens. The exchange rate to be used is the 90-day moving average price when the votes pass on both sides. \n\nAll 200,000 BAL tokens plus the aBAL tokens in the Reserve Factor (redeemed for BAL) are to be paired with sufficient ETH and deposited into the Balancer V2 BAL:ETH (80:20) pool. The veBAL holding will then participate in Balancer's revised tokenomics that commenced on the 28th March. \n\nInitially, the veBAL will be used to vote BAL rewards to pools which support aTokens that create TVL for Aave and/or AAVE liquidity pools.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave and Balance have a long history of working together. The AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool BPT is accepted within the Aave Safe Module and the newly created Balancer Boosted Pools drive TVL to Aave markets, [2].\n\nWhen the AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V1 pool is moved to Balancer V2 and integrated into Aave’s Safety Module, the veBAL tokens can be used to vote BAL rewards to the newly created AAVE : ETH (80/20) Balancer V2 pool.\n\nIn addition, the veBAL can be used to vote BAL rewards to Balancer Boosted Pools which utilise Aave markets in the background to create yield for passively held liquidity, [3]. There are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using veBAL to vote for BAL rewards to pools that strengthen Aave is a strategic advantage of deploying the BAL tokens into the BAL:ETH pool.\n\nBy exchanging AAVE for BAL, the tokenswap reflects the ongoing collaboration and shared vision through governance in each other’s community. The token exchange, plus additional acquisition, is significant enough for Aave to become just outside of the Top 50 BAL tokens holder, based on etherscan BAL holder rankings, [4]. Balancer will become a Top 80 AAVE holder, [5]. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to collaborate.\n\nAave will likely be one of the first movers in the upcoming BAL wars and will gain a strategic advantage to bootstrap new Balancer Boosted Pools which lead to tokens being deposited in Aave markets to earn yield. This has the benefit of creating TVL and Revenue for Aave.\n\nThe initial sizing to acquire 200,000 BAL was something that was reached via discussions with the Balancer community and happens to be the same size as the recent Tribe DAO and Balancer token swap, [6].\n\nThe initial sizing was also determined by the ability to influence how the BAL emissions are to be distributed. If all BPT from the BAL : ETH pool are converted to veBAL, Aave will receive 3.3% of the 14,500 BAL emission schedule which is equivalent to 478 BAL weekly, or $8,126/week at $17/BAL or $422,552/year. If 100% of the current BPT were deposited into the veBAL contract, the yield is very close to 10%. Other deployments from the Reserve Factor will also earn BAL rewards over time, [7].\n\nWith 3.3% of veBAL supply, Aave will determine where 2,680 of the 81,200 BAL tokens are to be distributed each week via the Ethereum mainnet pool gauge. This is equivalent to 5% APR on a $47.40M pool without any compounding or other yield sources like swap fees or yield from Aave markets. This is sufficient to support bootstrapping new liquidity pools that support growing TVL for the Aave community. Given the size of the Aave community investment in the Balancer community, it is reasonable to think that Liquidity Mining Committee may also be voting to allocate a portion of there 14,500 weekly BAL emission to support Balancer Boosted Pools which drive TVL to Aave markets.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe token swap is to be performed by both Balancer and Aave by depositing tokens into a contract like how Tribe DAO swapped TRIBE for INDEX, [8].\n\nThe aBAL holding in the Reserve Factor, 1,890 aBAL at the time of writing which will be redeemed for BAL and deployed along with the 200,000 BAL tokens attained via the proposed swap, [9].\n\nOnce the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor from there the BAL and matching amount of ETH will be deployed into the BAL : ETH pool on Balancer V2. The BPT token is deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year.\n\nThe veBAL holding is then used to direct incentives to new aToken Boosted Pools\n\n# References:\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512\n[2] https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xc697051d1c6296c24ae3bcef39aca743861d9a81/\n[3] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[4] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[5] https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9#balances\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-33-swap-between-balancer-dao-and-fei-dao/3555\n[7] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797\n[8] [https://github.com/fei-protocol/fei-protocol-core/blob/develop/contracts/utils/OtcEscrow.sol](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffei-protocol%2Ffei-protocol-core%2Fblob%2Fdevelop%2Fcontracts%2Futils%2FOtcEscrow.sol&data=04%7C01%7Cmatthew.graham2%40technipfmc.com%7Cfcf199dfb3f64bb3b4ca08da0b1a125b%7C0804c95193a0405d80e4fa87c7551d6a%7C0%7C0%7C637834504350429866%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&sdata=wnFuy5LgP7IJ2G7A4%2B1x%2FBMp1k1bbqw9%2Bk6jkuimd0E%3D&reserved=0)\n[9] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The final proposal will reflect the discussion on the governance forum.\n\naip: TBA\ntitle: ARC - Continue Liquidity Mining Program on Aave V2 Ethereum market and Initiate Liquidity Mining on Aave ARC market\nstatus: Proposal\nauthor: @MatthewGraham, @3SE_Holdings, @4lex.eth\ncreated: 03.02.2022\nDiscussion: https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-aave-v2-ethereum-market-and-aave-arc-market/7189\n\n----\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis ARC presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives on Aave V2 Ethereum market for an additional 90 days from when [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) finishes at a further 30% reduced rate.\n\nIn addition to tapering incentives on the Aave V2 market, the ARC proposes introducing incentives on the Aave ARC market. 10% of the 30% reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 ethereum market are to be applied to incentivising AUM on the Aave ARC Ethereum market.\n\n# Abstract\n\nLiquidity mining incentives were introduced to Aave V2 on the 26th April 2021 via [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG), renewed by [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) and then incentives were reduced by 30% with the implementation of [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH) which expires on the 20th February 2022. A summary is shown below.\n\n* [AIP-16](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th Apr 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-32](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): [2,200 stkAAVE per day](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E) from 24th Aug 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* [AIP-47](https://app.aave.com/#/governance/47-QmRTKqSJCMKysQonSHdxkawei78NmHe1aq6yAjDmWUPgqH): 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd Nov 2021 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 1,078 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* AIP-X: 46.2 stkAAVE per day from 21st Feb 2022 on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n\nContinuing on from AIP-47, incentives on low vol assets are to be split 1:2 in favour of borrowers over lenders. This logic will be applied to both Aave V2 and ARC markets. High vol assets will only receive lending incentives and this is skewed to favour more recently listed assets and communities that have a strategic relationship with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal continues on from AIP-47 with a further 30% tapering of incentives which was directionally communicated in the prior [ARC](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946) and shall last for another proposed 90 day period. We will continue with the same rationale for how incentives are distributed across the Aave V2 Ethereum market.\n\nThe incentive APR will fall, even though TVL has reduced with market conditions so has AAVE’s token price.\n\nIn addition to incentivising Aave V2 Ethereum market, I would like to present to the community an opportunity to commence distributing stkAAVE incentives on the Aave ARC market with the intention of achieving the following:\n\n1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)\n2. Increase liquidity\n3. Attractive (low) borrow rates\n4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor\n5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform\n\nWithin this proposal we will present two options for the Aave ARC markets, Option 2) will reflect a Total Value Locked in Aave ARC of $250M. This represents a 12.6x increase in TVL from what is a low base. The next iteration of liquidity mining will likely see an increased allocation to Aave ARC as we continue to encourage users to interact with the market. The initial target here is to grow Aave ARV to over $250M within the next 90 days and then pivot as required to support continual growth of the market.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below section outlines the proposed liquidity mining incentives to be applied from 21.02.2021 up to and including 20.05.2022.\n\nKey changes from the previous liquidity mining campaign:\n\n* 30% reduction in incentives to 1,078 stkAAVE per day on Aave V2 Ethereum market\n* Introduction of 26.2 stkAAVE per day on Aave ARC Ethereum market\n* Distribution of stkAAVE is pro rata based upon deposit dollar value\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave V2 Ethereum market asset listings. In estimating the Borrowing vAPR, a 75% utilisation of the deposited assets was assumed. This was based on the current DAI utilisation.\n\n![|464x287](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/d/d2ff417f056b6dd50b32d389b8167c92d86a39d4_2_1380x984.png \"Chart\")\nNote: TVL per token is as per the 3rd February 2022.\n\nThe table below shows the intend stkAAVE distribution across the Aave ARC market asset listings.\n\nOption 1) Same Methodology as above allocating 10% of the reduction in Aave V2 Ethereum Market stkAAVE incentives.

[Link here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe previous LM campaign indicated the ongoing tapering on the Aave V2 Ethereum market that is presented within this proposal. The introduction of incentives on Aave ARC reflects a desire to grow this mainnet market. Incentivising the Aave ARC market is funded from the reduction in incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The net incentive spend over the next 90 day period is reduced down from 1,540 to 1,124.2 stkAAVE per day.\n\nAarve ARC Option 1) we show what impact allocating 10% of the savings from the reduced Aave V2 Ethereum market would look like following a similar allocation strategy to the Aave V2 Ethereum market. The mathematics assumes 75% utilisation of lending pools capital is borrowed which reflects the current utilisation of the DAI pool on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. With zero wBTC deposited in the market, and still very low capital being deposited, this approach is heavily skewed towards USDC and mis represents what is expected with time.\n\nAave ARC Option 2) we elected to view the incentives in line with $250M and assumed a distribution across the pools. The distribution is an assumption and is quite different to the existing distribution on the Aave V2 Ethereum market. We can easily change these parameters and are happy to do so. The high level logic is to anticipate capital being deposited and then estimating what the vAPR from incentives would equate to. For this we assumed $250M which is arbitrarily chosen as a nice round target, it represents over 10x growth in the market TVL.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe previous LM proposal provides a lot of the context and rationale to how the stkAAVE incentives are distributed across the various assets on both markets. Link [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v2-liquidity-mining-program-90-days-at-30-reduced-rate/5946). Something of interest on the Aave V2 Ethereum market, large holders currently can turn a 336 bps and 344 bps profit based on the existing emission schedule across the DAI and USDC pools by recursive borrowing. (Lending vAPY, - borrowing vAPR, + Borrowing Incentives vAPR, + Lending vAPY)\n\nWith the newly proposed emission schedule this 336 bps return minus gas becomes a 289 bps and 292 bps profit before gas. Time in the pool is also a huge factor, and those already invested in this type of strategy may continue to do so. However, it would be a lot less appealing to deploy this strategy now. Tapering the incentives reduces the profitability of recursive borrowing but not sufficiently so to support unwinding the positions. The opportunity cost becomes more something to consider.\n\nWith the introduction of incentives on Aave ARC, even with around $250M deposited 60% in USDC, the strategy would be profitable with a 75% utilisation rate. This risks assets currently deposited in the Aave V2 Ethereum market being reallocated to the Aave ARC market. If this was to occur the vAPR from incentives on the Aave V2 Ethereum market would increase. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on the value deposited in each pool. Pending how the market reacts to these proposed changes, we can always revisit this and propose an amendment to the distribution schedule across both markets.\n\n## Economics\n\n* Aave V2 Ethereum markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $44.5K per day during late January 2022. Daily aToken interest is around $1.9K per day.\n* Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $168,630 per day assuming 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Down from $231,000 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $150 per token. Note, previous LM was budgeted using a stkAAVE price of $320.\n* Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $296.89M with an AAVE price of $150.\n* 90 days at 1,124.2 stkAAVE at $150 per token is $15.18M or around 5.11% of the Ecosystem Reserve.\n* The Net spend is $122K per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE/day Safety Module incentives\n* Daily Reserve Revenue has reduced significantly during January and the chart below shows the image of the recent market conditions. Not the economics above only takes into consideration Aave V1 and V2 market revenue.\n\nFurther details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/llama/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community. Please note, each query will need to be run separately.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: ARC - Strategic Partnership with Balancer Part #2\nstatus: Discussion\nauthor: Llama Community - @MatthewGraham\ncreated: 03-05-2022\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nAcquire 100,000 BAL tokens by deploying a Bonding Curve contract. The BAL tokens are to be held in the Reserve Factor until further details relating to Aura emerges and then the Aave community can determine if to deploy BAL to receive veBAL or auraBAL, [1].\n\n# Abstract\n\nDeploy a Bonding Curve to acquire an additional 100,000 BAL tokens on market at the chainlink oracle price +50 bps, for a cost $1,708,500 assuming a BAL price of $17. This is an additional purchase to the 200,000 BAL token swap being considered.\n\nAave will become one of eight token holders with 300,000 BAL tokens. All 100,000 BAL tokens are to be retained in the Reserve Factor until such time as further information on auraBAL emerges.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe original motivation for performing a token swap with Balancer can be found on the ARC - Strategic Investment BAL Token, [2].\n\nWith the additional 100,000 BAL acquisition, Aave would transition from just outside the Top 50 BAL holder to inside the Top 30 holders, [3]. If an additional 75,000 BAL was acquired, totalling 375,000 BAL, then Aave would become a Top 20 holder and this includes three community wallets, one Polygon bridge pool and the main BAL liquidity pool. So really it would be more like the Top 15 holders if another 75,000 BAL was acquired.\n\nWith 300,000 BAL tokens, Aave would have the largest BAL holding of any strategic partner Balancer has partnered with. The largest strategic partnership holding to date is the 270,000 BAL position held by Tribe DAO, [4,5]. Having a larger BAL holding relative to Tribe DAO may become a competitive advantage as Tribe DAO seeks to direct TVL to Rari Fuse pools with the use of the new ERC-4626 vault, [6].\n\nWith the emergence of ERC-4626, a new type of vault, whereby Liquidity Providers (LP) can deposit their stakes BPT tokens into lending pools and earn BAL rewards whilst using staked BPT as collateral, [7]. This is particularly appealing for staked BPT holdings which have minimal Impermanent loss risk. An example would be to use the staked BPT token for the stable coin Balancer Boosted Pool which uses Aave V2 to generate yield and receives BAL rewards, [8]. Based upon the success of wstETH being listed on Aave V2, this may lead to significant Total Value Locked (TVL) growth for Aave which makes up more than 13% of Aave’s mainnet V2 market TVL, [9].\n\nHaving not yet entered in the Curve / Convex tokenomics play, Aave has an opportunity to be an early leader in the veBAL wars. With the emergence of Aura, the Aave community has a choice to determine if the 100,000 BAL to be acquired are to be deployed for veBAL or auraBAL. If Aura is like Convex, then being early and building an Aura holding is worth considering. The first step in both strategies is to acquire a sizable BAL position and as the initial 200,000 BAL is proposed to be deposited into the veBAL contract and locked for 1 year, the 100,000 BAL detailed within this proposal can be deployed into either veBAL or auraBAL contracts.\n\nThere are likely to be many more Balancer Boosted Pools that utilise aTokens in the future and the veBAL votes can be used to help bootstrap these pools by directing BAL rewards to those pools. Using either veBAL or auraBAL to vote for BAL rewards towards pools that create TVL for Aave is a strategic advantage. If Aura evolves like Convex did, then the voter locked AURA token will have more voting influence over BAL rewards than one veBAL token. Being prepared and ready for the Aura token launch is going to position Aave to maximise the upside from its investments as rewards often favour early movers.\n\n# Implementation\n\nA Bonding Curve deployment utilising Chainlink’s BAL/USD oracle feed with a 50 bps incentive for arbitrage trades to acquire BAL on market and deposit into the contract. Aave will provide USDC to fund the Bonding Curve contract. An example of this type of transaction occurred when Tribe purchased $10M of DPI on market, [10].\n\nThe 50 bps fee is to provide an economic incentive for arbitrage traders to attain BAL on market and deposit BAL into the contract profitably by more than offsetting gas costs. This mechanism enables everyone within defi to participate and essentially crowdsources the BAL tokens on Aave’s behalf. Once the BAL has been received it will be transferred to the Reserve Factor.\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allowlist-aura-finance-in-balancer-votingescrow/2708\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-strategic-partnership-with-balancer/7617/15\n[3] https://etherscan.io/token/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d#balances\n[4] https://forum.balancer.fi/t/proposal-allow-tribe-dao-to-lock-vebal/2888\n[5] https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x7972e1700ac30495ad936038b66055b1e6420c3de5ed1fec963abe5faa2d16a3\n[6] https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-90-fuse-boosted-usd-balancer-pool-bb-f-usd/4023\n[7] https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626\n[8] https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x7b50775383d3d6f0215a8f290f2c9e2eebbeceb20000000000000000000000fe\n[9] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&marketName=proto_mainnet\n[10] https://etherscan.io/address/0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Repay Excess CRV Debt on Ethereum v2\nAuthor: @llamaxyz - @MatthewGraham \nDated: 2022-12-08\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis publication proposes sourcing CRV for the purpose of repaying the excess debt in the CRV Reserve on the Ethereum v2 liquidity pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThere are approximately 2,656,335 units of CRV of excessive debt in the Ethereum v2 CRV Reserve. At 66.35 cents per unit, a total of 1,762,478.27 USD, in the form of CRV tokens, is required to recapitalise the protocol. \n\nTo recapitalise the protocol, Llama proposes acquiring the full amount of CRV required to repay the excess debt from the existing USDC and aUSDC holdings.\n\nAave currently holds 6M units of aUSDC and 358.7k units of USDC in the Ethereum Collector Contract.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDecide on a path forward to repay the excess debt in the CRV market (currently ~$1.76M USD, dependent on CRV's token price). Llama proposes using funds held in the Aave v2 Collector Contract to repay the excess debt. As the excess debt must be paid in CRV tokens, Aave is required to acquire 2,152,041 units of CRV.\n\nThere is currently an active proposal whereby Gauntlet's insolvency fund (valued at around $280k) is to be transferred to the Economic Reserve. The insolvency fund only offsets a portion of the total cost incurred by Aave. There has been no indication of support from the community for using AAVE held within the Safety Module or from the Ecosystem Reserve to recapitalise the protocol. If Aave was to sell AAVE or stkAAVE to fund the CRV acquisition, there are two non exclusive ways of doing this:\n\n1) Auction via the shortfall event\n2) Swap contract where anyone can swap AAVE or stkAAVE for CRV\n\nOption 2 eliminates the need for negotiating any terms with a counterparty, or any counterparty needing to review contracts prior to interacting with a whitelisted contract. It is worth noting the Collector Contract holds insufficient AAVE or stkAAVE to support using AAVE <> CRV swaps. Any swap contract of this nature requires using the Economic Reserve. General discussion to date has indicated little appetite to sell AAVE to fund excessive debt.  \n\nThere has been some interest from the community to use the aCRV holding, currently 504,294 units, in the Ethereum Collector Contract to partially recapitalise the protocol. This is a partial solution  that is equivalent to just 18.98% ($334.6k) of the required CRV size needed. If the community was to use the aCRV position, a further 1,647,747 units of CRV are to be acquired.\n\nWith the launch of a new aToken, expected soon, Curve liquidity tokens can be deposited into Aave and still receive CRV rewards from the Curve gauges. Aave has the option to deploy the aCRV holding to veCRV and direct rewards towards Curve gauges that benefit the Aave ecosystem. This has the potential to become a meaningful income stream for Aave.\n\nIf Aave was to incur a delay in creating veCRV, historically this is one of the highest yielding reserves which is why CRV is the largest earning asset outside of the major stable coins. In more normal environments, over a 150 to 200 day period, the CRV reserve would generate sufficient yield to repay the excessive debt. This revenue source , CRV yield, would be lost if aCRV was used to fund repaying the excessive debt. Due to the potential upside, this publication supports retaining the aCRV holding.\n\nAs part of a broader consolidation of the Ethereum Collector Contract, approximately [$434.6k of assets](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-collector-contract-consolidation/10909) are to be swapped for USDC. This represents 24.7% of the funds required to recapitalise the protocol.\n\n### Holdings Summary\n\n| Holding          | $ Value     | % of Excessive Debt |\n| --------------   | -----------          | ------------------- |\n| aUSDC            | 6,002,226.07|              340.56      |\n| USDC             | 358,701.07  |                20.35      |\n| v2 Consolidation | 434,570.98  |           24.70      |\n| aCRV             | 330,834.02  |                18.98     |\n| Excessive Debt   | 1,762,478.27|          100       |\n\nThe table shows there is in total 385.61% more USDC relative to the excessive debt value. Do note this is only the USDC portion of the Collector Contract. There is also large DAI ($4,684,700.46) and USDT ($3,915,311.69) holdings.\n\nDue to the relative size of the USDC and the upside potential to the new aToken developed by Aave Companies, Llama suggests the community utilise the USDC and aUSDC holdings to acquire the full amount of CRV needed to recapitalise the protocol.\n\n# Specification\n\nDeploy a swap contract exchanging USDC and aUSDC for CRV. \n\nThe exchange rate is the Chainlink CRV/USD Oracle + 10 bps.\n\nCRV/USD Oracle: `0xCd627aA160A6fA45Eb793D19Ef54f5062F20f33f`\n\nEstimated Premium: 1,762,478.27 * 0.0010 = $1,762.48\nA $15,000 swap via ParaSwap at 14 gwei + depositing into the swap contract is estimated to cost $12 - $15, 10 bps is $15.\n\nA cap of $2M will be placed on swap contract. This is a defined ceiling which limits the amount of funds allocated for acquiring CRV on market. This essentially creates an upper price bound on the CRV price of 75.29 cents, which is a 13% above the current spot price, 66.35 cents. \n\nThe actor interacting with the swap contract will have the ability to select USDC and aUSDC by choosing true or false respectively.\n\nTo repay the excess debt, the repay function will be used. This function requires CRV as an input and the address the bad debt has accumulated within.\n\npool.repay(crv, total bad debt, variableInterest, Address)\n\nCRV: `ethereum:0xD533a949740bb3306d119CC777fa900bA034cd52`\nTotal Excessive Debt: 2,656,335 units of CRV\nAddress: `0x57e04786e231af3343562c062e0d058f25dace9e`\n\n# Next Steps\n\nDiscuss in the comment section the above proposal. A Snapshot will be presented for the two most popular options. At the time of writing, these appear to be:\n\nOption 1) Use USDC to acquire CRV\nOption 2) Use aCRV + USDC to acquire CRV\nOption 3) Do Not Recapitalise Protocol\n\nOption 3 gives the community the ability to not recapitalise the protocol.\n\nIf the Community was to prefer to sell AAVE, the preferred mechanism is a swap contract at the AAVE/CRV composite oracle rate. ie: AAVE/USD x USD/CRV >> AAVE/CRV There would be no premium offered such a swap. Let us know what you think in the comments.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
