As sufficient time has passed, it is now appropriate to move forward with the offboarding process for Aave V1.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAave V1 has served as a pioneering platform in the DeFi ecosystem. However, with the release of Aave V2 and Aave V3, it is essential to shift users and resources towards these more advanced and efficient platforms. By offboarding Aave V1 and encouraging migration to newer versions, we can ensure a more streamlined user experience and concentrate resources on continued development and improvements in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe offboarding plan will be executed by implementing new rate strategies for all assets listed on Aave V1. These rate strategies aim to incentivize users to migrate their assets to Aave V2 or Aave V3 by making borrowing and supplying less attractive on Aave V1. The new rate strategies will be applied to all assets listed on Aave V1.\n\n### **New Rate Strategies**\n\nFor each asset listed on Aave V1, new proposed values for the following parameters will be implemented:\n\n1. uOptimal: 20%\n2. reserveFactor: 99.9%\n3. base rate: 3%\n4. slope 1: 7%\n5. slope 2: 200%\n\nThese changes will make borrowing and supplying assets on Aave V1 less attractive compared to Aave V2 or Aave V3, encouraging users to migrate their assets to the newer platforms.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal.\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion and finalization of the proposal.\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Summary\nThis Snapshot aims to officially capture the community's agreement on adopting Chainlink Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to initiate the GHO cross-chain strategy. The details of the rollout plan and the configuration of risk parameters remain subjects for future governance discussions.\n\n## Motivation\nThe current limitation of GHO, which is primarily accessible only via minting on the Ethereum mainnet or through secondary markets, represents a significant constraint in its potential reach and utility across DeFi. We believe the future of GHO is to become a multichain asset where users can interact across various networks using GHO. Moving cross-chain increases the accessibility and liquidity of GHO for a larger spectrum of users.\n\nThe current moment is ideal for GHO to venture into new frontiers, and to facilitate this, it is essential to employ a solution that empowers users and stimulates growth. CCIP stands out for its high-speed and cost-effective token bridging, extensible compatibility to both EVM and non-EVM networks, ease of integration, and robust risk mechanisms. Aave Labs suggests implementing a canonical, unified cross-chain strategy for GHO using Chainlink's CCIP.\n\n## Specification\nAave Labs proposes using Chainlink [CCIP infrastructure](https://docs.chain.link/ccip) to move GHO across blockchain networks. This will allow the seamless transfer of the GHO token between source and destination networks. CCIP transfers tokens by locking/burning on the source chain and then releasing/minting on the destination network. Cross-chain GHO uses a combination of lock/release and mint/burn models, backing the aggregated liquidity across chains with locked GHO on Ethereum. Every destination chain will have a canonical version of the GHO token and an Aave Governance controlled facilitator with a specific bucket capacity.\n- Transferring GHO from Ethereum to another chain: GHO tokens get locked in a vault contract on Ethereum, GHO tokens get minted via Facilitator on the destination chain.\n- Transferring GHO from another chain to Ethereum: GHO tokens get burned via Facilitator on the other chain, GHO tokens get released from the vault contract on Ethereum.\n- Transfering GHO from one chain to another (none of them are Ethereum): GHO tokens get burned via Facilitator on source chain, minted via Facilitator on destination chain.\n\n![examples-ccip.png](ipfs://bafkreih46kvo7rrl4ylyobxyiqxis2kvplo7tqd223fje5zm2nooeut3eu)\n\nEach network will have a canonical version of GHO and a facilitator, controlled by Aave Governance, that will manage facilitator buckets and onboard GHO liquidity from Ethereum. The liquidity on each network will depend on the bucket capacity of the Facilitator and CCIP configuration (e.g. [rate limit](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/architecture#token-pool-rate-limit)). The total amount of liquidity across chains is always less than or equal to the amount of GHO tokens locked on Ethereum.\n\n## Next Steps\nOnce the community signals its consent for the implementation of CCIP to initiate the cross-chain strategy for GHO, the subsequent actions will be undertaken:\n- Initiate technical implementation process\n- Perform a thorough technical review to select the optimal networks for deployment.\n- Formulate a strategic rollout plan for the GHO cross-chain approach, in partnership with Risk Providers.",

        "body": "---\n## **Title: [ARFC]** Reset Aave v3 Deployment Pipeline\n\n## **Author: ACI - Aave Chan Initiative**\n\n## **Date: 2024-03-18**\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes that the DAO reset the current Aave v3 deployment pipeline and institute new ARFC votes for chains where Aave v3 is not yet deployed. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Aave v3 Deployment Pipeline is in need of a reset. The DAO has been overly lenient in approving new networks, and some of these approvals do not fit the current market environment.\n\nA reset will place the DAO in a better negotiating position and allow for a more efficient focus of our limited resources. This implies that all approved but not yet deployed networks will need to go through the ARFC process once more.\n\nIt is important to note that anything still in the temporary check phase will not be affected - this only applies to projects that have passed the ARFC snapshot. This reset is a necessary step in ensuring that all future deployments align with our strategic objectives and market conditions.\n\n# Specifications\n\nAll new Aave v3 deployment progress will be reset to the ARFC discussion phase. Chains that have previously passed an ARFC snapshot will be expected to resubmit a new ARFC following the [chain deployment framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-new-chain-deployment-framework/15694). Chains will be expected to justify the risk/return profile of a new deployment to the DAO and the expected return on time spent by DAO resources.\n\n# **Next Steps**\n\n1. **Community Engagement:** Engage with the Aave community to gather feedback on this ARFC.\n2. **ARFC Snapshot:** If community sentiment is favorable, initiate an ARFC snapshot to gauge official support for this proposal.\n3. **ARFC Snapshot:** If ARFC passes, the ARFC becomes cannon and new deployments will be expected to go through a revote.\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal. This ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nThis Snapshot aims to solidify the community’s preference around GHO’s starting parameters for the V3 Ethereum facilitator. \n\n## Voting Options\n\nGiven there is still some discussion around trade-offs between scalability and managing risk in terms of how aggressive the initial parameters should be, we believe it is best to take two options to Snapshot, option A as proposed by the ACI in consort with Chaos Labs, and option B as proposed initially by Aave Companies. The DAO’s preference can then be expressed clearly. \n\nFor option A, the following parameters are proposed in line with the ACI and Chaos Labs’ recommendations: \n\n|      **Parameter**     |           **Value**           |\n|:----------------------:|:-----------------------------:|\n|      Borrow Rate       |             1.5%              |\n|    Bucket Capacity     |             $100M             |\n| stkAAVE Discount Rate  |              30%              |\n|    Discount Limit      | 25% of total GHO bucket size  |\n\nFor option B, as proposed by Aave Companies, the following parameters are proposed: \n\n|      **Parameter**     |            **Value**            |\n|:----------------------:|:-------------------------------:|\n|      Borrow Rate       |                2%               |\n|    Bucket Capacity     |               $50M              |\n| stkAAVE Discount Rate  |                25%              |\n|    Discount Limit      |   25% of total GHO bucket size  |\n\nTo renew discussion at the Temp Check phase there is also an option to abstain. \n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce a community preference is expressed for GHO’s initial parameters on Aave V3 Ethereum via this temp Check, there will be a separate proposal, requesting approval for a Flashminter Facilitator with initial parameters, which will go through the Temp Check process. \n \nOnce both the V3 Ethereum Parameters and the FlashMinter Parameters are agreed upon via Snapshot both will be combined for a final ARFC.
