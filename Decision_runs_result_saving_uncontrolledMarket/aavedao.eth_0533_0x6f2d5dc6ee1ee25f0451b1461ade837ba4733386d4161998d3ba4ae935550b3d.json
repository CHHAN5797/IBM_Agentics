Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

With a TVL of approximately $5 billion, BNB Chain is the third-largest chain by TVL. The chain has a diverse array of DeFi offerings, including prominent projects like PancakeSwap, Venus, and several others. Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain has the potential to benefit both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and the potential for additional revenue. BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. Suggested risk parameters for each asset are provided in the table below. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\n| Risk Parameter | BNB | WBTC | BETH | WETH | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 65% | 70% | 60% | 80% | 82.5% | 70% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 75% | 70% | 82.5% | 85% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10% | 10% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 8.5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 15% | 15% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | N/A | 80.000 | 20,000,000 | 20.000.000 |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 | 5,000 | 20,000 | 100,000 | 50,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 75% | 45% | 45% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 6.1% | 7% | 7% | 4.8% | 4% | 4% |\n| Slope2 | 100% | 300% | 300% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~75$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nTemperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain.\n\nARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\nAIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",

Rocket Pools is expanding its support for rETH across the L2 ecosystem, first Optimism, now Arbitrum and soon Polygon. There are currently only Chainlink Oracles for Arbitrum and Ethereum. Thus, this publication presents listing rETH on Arbitrum ahead of Optimism.\n\nA new rETH liquidity pool and gauge has been created on Balancer v2 Arbitrum for rETH/bb-a-wETH. This pool will deposit wETH into Aave v3 on Arbitrum. Incentives are expected to follow soon. This publication is early and provides risk service providers adequate time to review the asset listing parameters whilst liquidity continues to grow.\n\nLST collateral types drive material borrowing revenue to Aave as users deposit the LST and borrow the corresponding network token. This is most evident on Ethereum where the LST- and wETH-yield-maximising loop is the source of the vast majority of wETH borrowing demand.\n\nBy providing LST diversification, Aave presents itself as a neutral platform offering users the choice between various LSTs. An added benefit of offering a variety of LSTs is the respective communities may elect to compete for user acquisition via Aave through offering incentives. This is currently happening on Aave v3 Polygon and Aave’s TVL has meaningfully increased from a relatively small base.\n\nRocket Pool offers Aave v3 users on Arbitrum an alternative to wstETH.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?**\n\nLlama does not receive any payments from Rocket Pool.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token ?**\n\nRocket Pool strives to embody the core ethos of Ethereum and DeFi, specifically the non-custodial, trustless nature that allows self-sovereignty to truly thrive. This leads to reduced Counter Party risk relative to other LST providers.\n\nRocket Pool stakers deposit ETH into the deposit pool, enabling a node operator to create a new Ethereum Network validator. You can stake as little as 0.01 ETH.\n\nIn doing so, users are given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH is deposited, and when the user deposited it. The ratio includes rewards that Rocket Pool node operators earn from:\n\n* The Ethereum network itself\n* Priority fees from block proposals\n* MEV rewards from block proposals\n\nrETH is a staked, interest earning wrapper of ETH that can be exchanged at any time. rETH is not a rebasing token and therefore represents a straight forward integration prospect for Aave.\n\nSince the Beacon Chain rewards, priority fees, and MEV rewards will constantly accumulate, this means that rETH's value effectively always increases relative to ETH. The rETH/ETH exchange rate is updated approximately every 24 hours based on the Ethereum network rewards earned by Rocket Pool node operators.\n\n![|602x436](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sMlYJ-qPHfY2tYHe1Mhs1wJksUHoMuahfUR_vD-nFYn3vVC34buszhgTZv8oSjGQVTKUsGLm1jzBlkLCoR1bN_gGG6QWZyxiXkHFeFvxympIK7fw8zOjmGqI-Qsw-ErQBhruZk_eby90o8WwKgescPc)\n\nFor details on how to stake ETH with Rocket Pool, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/). For those readers keen to learn more about rETH taxation implications, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token).\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nBy listing rETH as collateral, users benefit from staking rewards whilst taking out a loan.\n\nSimilar to other LSTs, there are a range of yield maximising strategies and lower carry cost leveraged trading strategies that users could deploy. Given the typically low borrowing cost for LSTs, users are able to borrow the LST and participate in yield strategies beyond the Aave protocol.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nRocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH development.\n\nRocket Pool is designed to cater to two main user groups; those that wish to participate in [tokenised staking using rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-2-5-tokenised-staking-48601d52d924#92b0) using as little as 0.01 ETH and those that wish to stake ETH and run a node in the network to help generate a higher return on investment than staking outside of the protocol due to commissions earned.\n\nFor more information on these two groups that make up the protocol, we'd highly recommend [reading article one in our explainer series](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd) that goes into great detail on how users can participate, be it via tokenised staking or running a node in the protocol.\n\nThe core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party. This is a principle directly linked to Ethereum and ETH itself, and a mindset used at every stage of the process as Rocket Pool has evolved.\n\n![|602x216](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fqwfASEawOZPpIGTuda282owPW_7OJNQ2sK-XLi1Bq4Y09EpnHnfcehIr7n-3jHDqu02Iw676wV8RwPq0KcoUn9V1wtRRXGDF-wCRDdRO5_atRmJ2x2UjjkDRlv9zbOV2hcV1-hcevUGvulZOzLIGJI)\n\n**5. How is the rETH token currently used ?**\n\nThe distribution of rETH is spread thinning across many addresses. According to Arbiscan, the largest holding is only 3.13% of supply on Arbitrum.\n\nrETH is new to Arbitrum and because of this, there are only a few extrinsic use cases. Providing liquidity on DEXs is one of the main use cases to date on mainnet and we expect this to be mirrored on Arbitrum. The new rETH/bb-a-wETH pool will soon receive incentives and will bootstrap a second liquidity pool complementing the existing Uniswap v3 pool.\n\nWith supporting liquidity and an oracle derived from DEX and CEX liquidity across several networks, Aave is positioned to be the dominant rETH lending/borrowing liquidity pool on Arbitrum. For reference, there is currently [$20.03M](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) of rETH deposits on Aave v3 Ethereum.\n\nFor further insights into how rETH is integrated across the ecosystem, please refer to this Rocket Pool community-maintained Defi Opportunities publication.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. rETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\n* The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities\n\n**8.

This testnet deployment was done for testing purposes by the @AaveCompanies team.\n\nSince ZkEVM is EVM-equivalent, deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work.\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative supports L2 diversity as part of its governance platform.\n\nThis minimal Aave V3 deployment, with strictly limited assets onboarding (”MVP V3”), can be an opportunity to establish a strategic Aave presence early in this new network while staying conservative in terms of risk.\n\nThis ARFC proposal should be considered as a \"temperature check\" that would allow development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the zkEVM network.\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to “temp check” the deployment of a MVP version of Aave V3 on the ZkEVM L2.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe proposal to deploy Aave V3.0.1 on the ZkEVM L2 network, also known as \"MVP V3,\" presents an opportunity for Aave Governance to establish a strategic presence on this new network early on. Aave has a history of pioneering in new frontiers, starting with the Polygon & Avalanche V2 deployment in 2021.\n\nZkEVM is an L2 solution developed by the Polygon team that is EVM-equivalent. Deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work. However, to reduce risk, the proposal suggests limiting asset onboarding and setting conservative risk parameters. This will enable development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the ZkEVM network. The proposal recommends onboarding only three collaterals (WETH, WMATIC & USDC) and one borrowable asset (USDC) to reduce risk exposure.\n\nIt is important to note that the presented risk parameters should be considered as suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\nThis proposal also lays the groundwork for an \"MVP\" L2 GHO facilitator if governance considers this option in the future.\n\nOverall, this proposal has the potential to expand Aave's reach in the DeFi space by allowing it to expand to new \"frontier\" networks.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy an “MVP V3” of Aave V3.0.1 with only three collaterals: WETH, WMATIC & USDC, and only one borrowable asset: USDC.\n\n| Risk Parameter | WETH | MATIC | USDC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES |\n| Stable borrowing | N/A | N/A | NO |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 65% | 82.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 70% | 85% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 10% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | 20,000,000 |\n| Supply Cap | 25,000 | 15,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 7% | 6.1% | 4% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% | 75% | 90% |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 100% | 60% |\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by Polygon for publishing this AFRC.\n\nHowever, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, is a compensated DeFi strategy advisor for the Polygon Foundation. Although this AFRC is not specifically part of his role, it could be interpreted as such.\n\nAs part of its delegate platform, the ACI promotes L2 diversity.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Marc Zeller holds MATIC, the native asset of the Polygon protocol, and MaticX, a LSD of MATIC, as well as significant holdings on the Polygon POS blockchain, worth approximately $250k.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",

        "body": "### Sentence Rational\n \nThe BiLira team would like to submit a proposal to onboard TRYB. The purpose of this AIP is to list BiLira (TRYB), the only and 1:1 Turkish Lira-backed stablecoin, on AAVE V3, Avalanche Network, Isolation Mode.\n\n### References:\n\nLink to:\n[Project](https://www.bilira.co/en/home).\n[Whitepaper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fb683a258cbdf70262c0b77/6023c066d244a79a1c000761_Whitepaper-(EN-1.0).pdf).\nToken Contracts: [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2c537e5624e4af88a7ae4060c022609376c8d0eb).[Avalanche](https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x564a341df6c126f90cf3ecb92120fd7190acb401).[Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4fb71290ac171e1d144f7221d882becac7196eb5).[Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/A94X2fRy3wydNShU4dRaDyap2UuoeWJGWyATtyp61WZf).[BNB](https://bscscan.com/address/0xC1fdbed7Dac39caE2CcC0748f7a80dC446F6a594).\n[Dune Analytics Dashboard](https://dune.com/memoshi/tryb-bilira).\n\n### Paragraph Summary:\nThe BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is available on 6 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards. As emerging technologies continue to expand across the globe, the concept of open internet has allowed individuals all around the globe to instantly, securely and effortlessly share value and this created a need for non-USD stablecoins. We want to add TRYB to AAVE V3.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nBiLira offers every Turkish citizen a seamless connection to the decentralized internet. As emerging technologies continue to expand across the globe, the concept of the open internet - a fundamental network of information that is free and accessible to everyone regardless of financial motives - has allowed individuals all around the globe to instantly, securely, and effortlessly share information. The contributions to this advancement are immense and its impact is still unraveling around the world. \nToday, crypto assets and blockchain technology provide the means to transfer assets globally, securely, and at a low cost. Establishing an open internet based on value exchange can pave the way for a seamless, borderless and integrated world, which can eliminate barriers that enable the development of a global marketplace that is both economical and inclusive of everyone. \n\n\n### Specifications:\n\n### 1.What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nBiLira Team is the author of the AIP and the Asset.\n\n### 2.Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nThe BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on 6 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards\nBiLira goes through regular audits performed by independent 3rd parties which can be found [here](https://www.bilira.co/en/audit-reports).\n\n### **BiLira (TRYB)**\n\nTRYB is a Turkish Lira backed stablecoin. BiLira aims to bridge the gap between web 2.0 (monetized by fiat) and web 3.0 (fueled by crypto assets), to offer a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance.  \nThe legacy financial system is dependent on private organizations and third-party services which makes it challenging for individuals to connect to the open internet and transact with one another. The current infrastructure does not support a transition from Web 2.0 banking system to the Web 3.0 crypto-based native web currencies. Since mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are volatile, the public is looking for a better way that is more stable and safe to interact with digital assets and cryptocurrencies \n\n\nJust as information flows freely between web browsers, BiLira aims to make transferring value between wallets effortless, instant, and borderless for everyone.\n\n### 3.Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nTRYB (BiLira) is a great fit both as a borrow and collateral asset for the Aave ecosystem. \nAAVE will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community by listing the reliable and only Turkish Lira backed stablecoin, TRYB (BiLira). Turkey was the world’s fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020 and became the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East in 2021. By enabling this user base to be able to use their currency as collateral, Aave will welcome a lot of new users to enter into DeFi.\nThere are also multiple institutional and retail players that want to borrow TRYB to market make in Turkish Lira denominated crypto markets.\n\n### 4.Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?) products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe stablecoin TRYB(BiLira) was released in early 2020.\nAs it is a 1:1 fiat backed stablecoin doesn’t have any pegging issues due to its nature.\n\n### 5.How is the asset currently used?\n\n###### Advanced fiat on/off-ramp:\nBiLira offers a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high price volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance. BiLira builds a fiat <> crypto on/off ramp for users to interact with global exchanges and DEXs as it is the only Turkish Lira backed stablecoin. \n\n###### Global coverage: \nIt will allow Turkish Users to participate on Aave with only a domestic bank transfer.  Aave will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community. Turkey was the world’s fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020 and became the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East in 2021. Turkey topped a million trades a day by the end of 2021. With over 40 exchanges operating in Turkey, the Middle East’s largest economy and home to around 85mn people, the adoption of cryptocurrencies is ever expanding. Turkish residents using cryptocurrencies were recorded at 16% to 20% between 2020 and 2022. Latest surveys show there are over 5 to 6 million Turkish people with cryptocurrency accounts. A cryptocurrency exchange in the country reported nearly 5 million users and had a trading volume of $203.5 million. \n\n###### Towards Decentralization:\nTurkish crypto users generally start their crypto journey through the local exchanges because they do not have to deal with the complexities of the blockchain technicalities, such as use of wallets and addresses. The BiLira team believes in the future of the Web3 decentralized ecosystem, where users control their assets via their own wallets, removing intermediaries and interacting with DeFi.\n\n### 6.Emission schedule\nBiLira is always fully collateralized and backed 1:1 by TRY fiat reserves.\n\n### 7.Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nTRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves, BiLira (1 TRYB) is always supported by one unit of the reserve currency (1 TRY). There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRYB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount of TRYB. \n\n-MasterMinter - adds and removes minters and increases their minting allowance (2 out of 3)\n-Minters - create and destroy tokens (2 out of 3)\n-Pauser - pause the contract, which prevents all transfers, minting, and burning (2 out of 3)\n-Blacklister - prevent all transfers to or from a particular address, and prevents that address from minting or burning (2 out of 3)\n-Owner - re-assign any of the roles except for admin (2 out of 3)\n-Admin - upgrade the contract, and re-assign itself (2 out of 3)\n \nThe signers of the Multisig are the cofounders of the BiLira Company\n \n### 8.Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nDaily trading volume, market capitalization, and other relevant analytics\n-Total Issuance: 3,782,105,670 TRY\n-Total Redemption: 3,642,521,623 TRY\n-TRYB AUM: 139,584,047 TRY\n-Fiat Reserves: 139,584,047 TRY\n-Total on-chain transfer volume:  30,002,670,196 TRYB\n-Listed on FTX, MEXC, Bitget, Bittrex, Liquid, Pangolin and DFX\n-Oracle data for TRYB is available on Chainlink\n\n### 9.Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BiLira_Official).\n[Telegram](https://t.me/BiLira_Official).\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bilira/mycompany/).\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPNEFF7BjAcEd_JcwklbKQ).\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bilira_official/?hl=en).\n[News: Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bilira).\n[News: Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/search?query=tryb).\n[Conferences: Converge22](https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1549682084599455744).\n\n\nThe total size of the media community is over 50,000+ users across all social media platforms\n\n## Risk Parameters\n### V3 Isolation mode: \n-Loan-to-Value (LTV): 0%\n-Liquidation Threshold: 70% \n-Liquidation Bonus: 10% \n-Reserve Factor: 10%\n\n$10 Mil USD Debt Ceiling (Equivalent to 185 Mil TRY Debt Ceiling)\n\n### 10.

BiLira has been audited by the Central Bank of Turkey. Users need to go through the KYC and AML process.\n-There haven’t been any hacks or vulnerabilities on the project\n-The contract is verified on the explorers mentioned above in market statistics\n-The project can’t be considered a security as TRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves, BiLira (1 TRYB) is always supported by one unit of the reserve currency (1 TRY). There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRYB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount of TRYB.\n\n### Voting Options\nYES - add TRYB on Aave V3\nNO - do not add TRYB on Aave V3\n",
