        "body": "---\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Further Aave v1 deprecation strategy\n\nAuthor: BGD Labs @bgdlabs\n\nDate: 2024-01-09\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nApprove further steps of Aave v1 off-boarding, to reduce operational overhead on deprecated Aave instances.\n\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave protocol v1 was released in January 2020 and eventually superseded by Aave protocol v2 in December on the same year.\n\nWhile Aave v1 has been deprecated for a long time, some liquidity is still stuck on the protocol 1. Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.\n\nThis creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.\n\nFor the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.\n\n\n## Specification\nTo achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:\n\n- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.\n- All assets have to be withdrawn.\n\nTo minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.\n\n### Phase 1\nIn a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:\n\n- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).\n- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.\n- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).\n- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.\n- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.\n\nThe exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.\n\n### Phase 3\nOnce the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.\n\nIt is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.\n\n---\n\nAfter all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.\n\nFinally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",

        "body": "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings\n\nAuthor: @Dydymoon\n\nDate: 2023-08-29\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Proposal resubmitted as the last vote didn't reached the quorum.*\n\n# Summary\nExplain AIP-42 proposal & gauge the community thoughts to update the strategic assets from veBAL to an alternative solution increasing the emission power considering current metrics.\n\n# Background\nIn March 2022, Llama proposed a strategic partnership with Balancer (Part I & Part II). The DAO used the BAL to buy B-80BAL-20WETH LP tokens, that would be locked for veBAL. This position was meant to be used for its emission power, enabling rewards redirection on AAVE & GHO gauges.\n\nThis estimated veBAL position & market metrics at the time were taken into account for the SM upgrade proposals (which includes migrating the current LPs to Balancer V2, implement new categories & slashing parameters, define the smBPT gauges, updates incentives management, create a strategic asset management framework, and further considerations.)\n\nConsidering that veBAL was likely to be needed before the SM upgrade implementation, Llama introduced the StrategicAssetsManager contract, creating a base framework to manage assets from Goverance or with a committee. The TEMP check vote ended mid July, and the contract was submitted to BGD for review after.\n\nFrom Llama’s side, the code supporting veBAL position is already implemented via the StrategicAssetManager contract and can be deployed pending community feedback. However, an external proposal from Aura drastically impacted the veBAL strategy early August.\n\n# Motivation\nOn July 28th, a proposal (AIP-42) was submitted 4 on the Aura governance forum, with the goal of improving $AURA distribution efficiency especially on L2s and alignment of parties receiving Aura rewards.\n\nWhile there are benefits for Aura and vlAURA holders, this proposal also directly impacts veBAL holders in several ways, which is why the Aave DAO should be aware of it.\n\nThe proposal (approved on August 6th) considerably impacts the $AURA emissions by reducing the base distribution by 60%, which is compensated by $AURA distributed from the treasury, but only to vlAURA voters according to their voting weight on gauges.\n\nAs a reminder, there are min & max APR on Balancer, depending on veBAL holdings/boost acquired, while Aura is using its share of the veBAL supply to boost LPs & add AURA rewards in return of a fee on BAL rewards, making it more efficient for most LPs to deposit.\n\nFor this reason, the value of incentives generated per 1$ of bribes can take into account BAL + AURA emissions, which was equivalent before AIP-42 (i.e you’d get the same emission power by farming on Aura & voting with veBAL or with vlAURA)\n\n*Post AIP-42 this changes, because:*\n\n* veBAL emission power is limited to BAL + base Aura rewards (reduced by 60%)\n* vlAURA emission power is increased with BAL + base AURA + additional AURA rewards from Treasury\n\nAura will keep boosting LPs with its veBAL share, and should keep a higher APR than Balancer for depositors.\n\nConsidering that emissions changes took effect on August 24th on Aura, it’s still early to draw conclusions and it might take time for the market to react & adapt. While some changes can already be observed, it might take at least 1-2 extra rounds (2-4 weeks) for the market to normalize.\n\n## Potential impacts of AIP-42 related to Aave utilization:\n\n### veBAL emission power reduced:\n\nAs only vlAURA can redirect extra rewards from the treasury, 1 veBAL will have less emission power than the equivalent vote in vlAURA.\n\n### veBAL holders migration to vlAURA:\n\nAssuming that veBAL holders are considering to switch to vlAURA, it could have several sub impacts:\n\n* veBAL holders choosing to let their position decay to exit (increased BAL emission per veBAL: temporary if ppl then migrate to auraBAL or another wrapper effectively relocking veBAL, but not if assets are sold for AURA and locked.)\n\n* If veBAL holders sell their BPT for AURA on market, the AURA price would increase because of the limited liquidity. It could also impact BAL price and B-80BAL-20WETH liquidity.\n\n* If the veBAL accumulation by Aura protocol is not following this potential migration, it would lead to a dilution of the veBAL underlying vote per vlAURA (a small decrease was already visible over the past days, to 0,1587 veBAL/vlAURA currently)\n\n### veBAL/vlAURA bribe cost update by the market:\n\nSome changes are already visible on bribe marketplaces, but we should expect more updates to happen in the coming weeks: Since veBAL has less emission power, the bribe cost should also decrease. On the other side, since the overall AURA emission is lower, so the bribe cost also seem to decrease, but the value / veBAL vote should increase, creating a decorrelation in the pricing depending on which asset is bribed. Another aspect to take in consideration post AIP-42 is the proportion of vlAURA votes / total votes bribed.\n\nBefore Aura proposal, the emissions were equivalent, but now, whether the split is 20% veBAL 80% vlAURA or the opposite considerably changes the results, so it’s most likely to see vlAURA bribed first.\n\n### Pros of switching to vlAURA:\n\n* Max emission power on DAO owned strategic assets\n* 4 months lock (compared to veBAL lock time is 1 year)\n* No decay on vlAURA, meaning no need to relock weekly\n* Voting are calculated in round (2 weeks) so less votes to cast\n\n### Cons of switching to vlAURA:\n\n* Liquidity is small so it can be an issue if Aave DAO wants to acquire AURA on market but OTC deals can be considered\n* Risk of efficiency reduction if the Aura protocol BAL accumulation doesn’t follow the vlAURA supply increase.\n* No veBoost on vlAURA (but Aura deposits are boosted with their veBAL share)\n\nvlAURA allows for more agile management. Considering that Aave DAO voted to lock veBAL but didn’t lock it yet, it makes sense to consider an update of the strategic assets allocation.\n\n# Other Considerations:\n\n* Long-standing strategic relationship between Aave and Balancer\n* Cost of selling B-80BAL-20WETH BPT\n* Cost of acquiring vlAURA via OTC deals\n* Understanding any potential security and ecosystem risks involved\n* Dev resources to add vlAURA support to current StrategicAssetManager\n* Review time by BGD of the vlAURA implementation\n\n# Specifications:\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to consider an update of the Balancer ecosystem holdings (B-80BAL-20WETH) for an alternative solution. This would mean dedicating part (or all) of the current B-80BAL-20WETH holdings to acquiring vlAURA in order to retain the max emission capacity of the voting power held by the DAO.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, ARFCs will be published:\n\n* To add vlAURA support to the StrategicAssetManager contract (Llama)\n* To share options considered for AURA tokens acquisition (TokenLogic)\n\n# Disclaimer:\nCurrently contributing to TokenLogic & Llama as a strategist, I participated in the Llama proposals mentioned above and am currently working on SM strategy, as well as on the GHO liquidity strategy with TokenLogic.\n\nThe analysis can be useful for both purposes above but is published on my own initiative, so this proposal is not requesting compensation from any third party. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared to facilitate understanding & community discussion.\n\n# Next Steps:\nTEMP CHECK: Gather community feedback and sentiment towards the proposal of updating Balancer ecosystem holdings for a more efficient solution with the following voting options:\n\n- YAE (Update the strategy)\n- NAY (Use veBAL as intially voted)\n- ABSTAIN\n\nARFCs: If the TEMP CHECK Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\nAIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",

        "body": "Introduction\n\nThis snapshot temp check asks the AaveDAO to approve a bug bounty program hosted on Immunefi. Immunefi proposes to engage with community contributors, the Aave Companies and BGD Labs, who would support the bug bounty program as technical experts in terms of receiving and evaluating bug reports as well as providing their view on what should and shouldn’t be covered under the program, pending DAO approval.\n\n\nMotivation\n\nCurrently, the Aave Protocol boasts a TVL of over USD 5 billion. A key reason why the protocol has managed to amass such impressive liquidity is due to the DAOs security-focused culture. Users of the protocol feel safe when using Aave.\n\nAs the Protocol continues to develop thanks to impressive work done by DAO contributors, with some notable innovations being V3 and GHO, it continues to be incredibly important that as much care is taken to ensure that users feel safe when using the protocol.\n\nOne great way to further protect user funds is to enact an effective and standardized bug bounty program. A bug bounty program encourages security researchers to continuously look through our codebase and responsibly disclose any bugs that they find, especially as new types of vulnerabilities are being discovered. Additionally, it provides a last option for blackhat hackers who find a bug to disclose it instead of exploiting it and get rewarded with clean funds.\n\n\nAbout Immunefi\n\nImmunefi is the leading bug bounty and security services platform for Web3, featuring the world’s largest Web3 security community and bug bounty programs. Immunefi guards many billions in users’ funds across projects like Wormhole, MakerDAO, Polygon, Chainlink, Lido, Stacks, Optimism, and many more. The company has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities that put tens of billions of dollars at risk across hundreds of projects.\n\n\nImplementation\n\nImmunefi proposes to work together with two other community contributors, Aave Companies and BGD Labs, in order to ensure that the bug bounty program is written and maintained to an optimal level, ranging from the assets that are covered by the program, SLAs with regards to response times, rewards for valid bug reports, as well as points of clarification within the program. The terms of implementation in this section is thus not set in stone but will be the starting point for the program.\n\nThe assets considered as in-scope of the bug bounty program will be those that are identified as critical to the operation of the Protocol. However, in order to ensure maximum safety for Aave users, a bug report would be considered as in-scope regardless of the asset being listed or not as long as it is a Critical-level smart contract report with funds being directly at risk.\n\nAll rewards for bug reports will utilize the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System. If Immunefi develops a new classification system, the one implemented into the Aave bug bounty program may be changed to reflect these changes, and would request a review from both Aave Companies and BGD Labs. \n\nFor the Aave bug bounty program, we will begin with covering Low to Critical vulnerabilities for smart contract assets. Additional severity levels will be considered shortly after its launch.\n\nThe reward amounts will be as follows:\n\nSmart Contracts\nCritical - Up to USD 1 000 000\nHigh - Up to USD 100 000\nMedium - Up to USD 5 000\nLow -Up to USD 1 000\n\nFinal amounts will be decided after the scoping stage. \n\nCritical smart contract vulnerabilities will be further capped at 10% of direct funds at risk. In cases of repeatable attacks, only the first attack is considered unless the smart contract cannot be upgraded or paused. If the attack impacts a smart contract directly holding funds that cannot be upgraded or paused, the amount of funds at risk will be calculated with the first attack being at 100% of the funds that could be stolen and then a reduction of 25% from the amount of the first attack for every 300 blocks the attack needs for subsequent attacks from the first attack, rounded down. For avoidance of doubt, if a second attack would happen at 600 blocks and then a third at 900 blocks, the funds at risk would be counted at 50% and 25% from the first attack, respectively.\nHowever, there will be a minimum reward such that the reward amount is above that of High in order to prevent hackers from sitting on a bug report while potential economic damage increases.\n\nRewards over USD 150 000 will be paid out in batches of up to USD 150 000 until the full reward amount is paid out. The first batch will be paid out within the SLA period for resolving a bug report and the monthly payout starts in the succeeding calendar month if the first Monday falls 15 days after the first payout.\nHigh smart contract vulnerabilities will be further capped at up to 100% of the funds affected. In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles for every additional 5 blocks that the funds could be temporarily frozen, rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5, up to a maximum hard cap of the maximum High reward. This is implemented in order to account for the increased relative impact based on the duration of the freezing of funds. There will be, however, a minimum reward for High smart contract vulnerabilities.\n\nIn addition to the standard bug report information requested by Immunefi in its bug submission page, a runnable proof of concept (PoC) will be required for all smart contract bug reports. Exceptions may be made in cases where the vulnerability is objectively evident from simply mentioning the vulnerability and where it exists.\n\nAll bug report submitters must comply with the Immunefi rules. Employees and team members of the community contributor teams (including Aave Companies and BGD Labs in case the DAO supports that they are nominated to assist Immunefi), including those who held this status within 12 calendar months of a bug report date, are not eligible for any reward.\n\nPayments will be made in stablecoins that are held in the treasury as well as AAVE from the Ecosystem Reserve.\n\n\nImmunefi Fee\n\nAs its standard fee, Immunefi will charge the DAO a performance fee based on the reward paid out to the bug bounty hunter, charged on top of the reward. This standard fee is 10%. Effectively this means that if a bug bounty hunter receives a reward of USD 1 000, Immunefi would be paid an additional fee of USD 100.\nImmunefi will charge no onboarding or maintenance fees for hosting and assisting with the bug bounty program. Any add-on services will be dealt separately, if ever additional services are desired in the future.\n\n\nEngagement with the DAO\n\nAs part of the above-mentioned program, it is required that there are entities directly in contact with Immunefi who can work on behalf of the DAO to review submissions and engage with security researchers along with other tasks. \nNaturally, as part of the bug bounty program extremely sensitive information could be shared.\n\nIf this program and our engagement with it is approved by the DAO, the responsibility of both companies will be the following:\n\n-Engage with Immunefi in defining and launching the bug bounty program.\n\n-Review all bug bounty submissions and assign a level of severity.\n\n-Respond and engage with the security researcher to resolve and patch any vulnerabilities, though it is understood that the security researcher’s responsibility ends at providing information about the bug and not providing work for fixing.\n\n-Any other stated responsibility as set out by the Immunefi statement of work.\n\n-Update the DAO on important information regarding the program.\n\nBGD Labs and Aave Companies in their capacity in supporting Immunefi would also seek to comply with the necessary SLAs wherever it is not restricted by governance systems within the Protocol, such as payments. This would be to ensure that security researchers can expect the same level of responsiveness that they do with other bug bounty programs on Immunefi.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis snapshot temp check proposes an Immunefi bug bounty program for the AaveDAO. The intention of this program is to properly incentivise white hats to test the security of the protocol and report recognised vulnerabilities. If approved, Aave Companies and BGD Labs would engage with Immunefi on behalf of the DAO.\n\n\n",

        "body": "---\n\n**Title**: *[ARFC] BGD. Security budget request - December 2023*\n\n**Author**: *BGD Labs (@bgdlabs)*\n\n**Date**: *2023-12-8*\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nRequest for a budget of $121’200 for 2 security review procedures on Aave, together with a refund of $30’000 to BGD for the Aave Governance v3 extra voting tokens audit.A\n\n\n**Amounting a grand total of $151'200**.\n\n\n## Motivation\nPart of [our scope Aave <> BGD Phase II](https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-bored-ghosts-developing-phase-2/14484#scope-6) is the planning, engagement, and coordination with security partners of the DAO.\n\nDuring the previous year and a half, Aave was in a pretty intensive delivery phase (Aave v3 improvements, GHO, Aave Governance v3, a.DI), and we thought it was appropriate to have continuous engagement with 2 security firms like Certora and SigmaPrime.\n\nEven if this worked well, and [we still think that Certora should stay with a continuous engagement](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-continuous-security-proposal-aave-certora/15732/4), we also think that there is room for optimisation, and it is a good idea to do more ad-hoc requests for the security budget, depending on the needs.\n\nThis ARFC is an initial request, for budget required in the short term on item part of our development services scope, together with another more general we consider pretty important.\n\n## Specification\nThis request has 3 components, which we want to explain to the community:\n\n---\n\n**1. Compensation for Mixbytes review of Governance v3 tokens**\n\nDuring the activation of Aave Governance v3 on October 17th, we detected a problem with the voting assets, which required the cancellation of the proposal, the development of a fix, and re-apply security procedures.\n\nGiven that it was already audited code, we also decided to do an extra security review by another security firm, Mixbytes.\n\nFor the sake of speed and reducing bureaucratic blockers, **BGD paid for the cost of said security review of $30’000, and now we will include on this proposal a refund request for that amount**.\n\n---\n\n**2. Compensation for security review on a feature of Aave 3.1**\n\nAlso part of our Phase 2 scope is to do a series of improvements to Aave v3, in order to reach a 3.1 version, from the current 3.0.2.\n\nGenerally, we are confident with Certora reviewing all the planned items until now, but there is one exception (an specific feature) to which we thought an extra review was required, and we engaged Emanuele Ricci (@StErMi), a top-level security researcher with knowledge of Aave to do it.\nWe will be publishing soon everything to be included into v3.1.\n\nSame as with Mixbytes, BGD has paid the cost of said security review of $12’000, and now we include the refund request on this proposal.\n\n---\n\n**3. Engagement with Spearbit for Aave v3 ad-hoc review**\n\nAave v2/v3 is a production system with billions of dollars in size, and one of the most evaluated protocols security-wise.\nHowever, security is a continuous process, and always worth it to improve whenever it feels necessary.\n\nDuring the last 1-2 months, we have noticed different security exploits in the space following similar patterns. None of them affected Aave, but apart from our continuous analysis of the system security-wise, we think it is necessary to do an extra round of review in critical parts of Aave, for additional assurance.\n\nWe have coordinated an engagement for this review scope with Spearbit, one of the leading security firms in the space, that will involve 3 of their top researchers checking in-depth different components that we identify as critical on Aave.\n\nThis engagement is scheduled to start in the second part of December, and different from the others, the payment requested in the proposal will be direct to Spearbit, for an amount of $109’200.\n\n---\n\nFrom a technical perspective:\n- The proposal will send $42'000 to BGD as compensation for the expenses of part 1) and 2).\n- $109'200 will be sent to a Spearbit wallet, to compensate for the services to be provided on part 3).\n\n*The final addresses and stablecoins of the treasury to use will be included in the AIP stage, previous coordination about the last with contributors to the financial area of the Aave DAO*",

        "body": "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings\n\nAuthor: @Dydymoon\n\nDate: 2023-09-26\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Summary\nFollowing the approval of this TEMP CHECK explaining AIP-42 potential impacts, this proposal will evaluate options to update holdings to maintain maximum emission power by acquiring AURA tokens to keep being exposed to the Balancer ecosystem while optimizing the voting power.\n\n# Context\n\nAIP-42 leads to a decorrelation of the incentives amounts generated on veBAL & vlAURA, as veBAL emission power is limited to BAL + base Aura rewards, while vlAURA receives additional AURA rewards allocated by the DAO treasury.\n\nLooking at the vote incentives market a few weeks after the update went live, we can observe that the majority of cost paid per vote decreased on both layers. However, it’s common to still see projects overpaying so it might take more time for the full market to understand these changes.\n\nFor more context, some veBAL holders voted for the GHO gauges over the past two months without receiving bribes, enabling to generate ~ $300k of incentives on GHO gauges.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to propose several options to update the Balancer ecosystem holdings of the DAO by acquiring AURA to increase its maximum emission power.\n\n*Current data (September 30th)*\nAURA price: 0,84$\nveBAL/vlAURA ratio: 0,1598\nveBAL value acquired per 1$ of vlAURA bought: 1,88$.\n\n## Initial Est. veBAL position\n\nAave DAO acquisition of 157K B-80BAL_20WETH was executed on this proposal 2. If the full amount was locked, the weekly emissions value would be ~ $7,7K per week.\n\n## Current DAO holdings\n\nShortly after this proposal 4 was submitted, TokenLogic submitted two proposals: a first time sensitive one to acquire 443k AURA OTC from Olympus DAO with DAI 1, executed on this AIP, and another to sell the corresponding value in BPT for GHO 2, approved on the following TEMP CHECK.\n\nThe table below shows the Olympus OTC deal data & impact on Aave treasury once executed using current GHO & BPT prices.\n\nIf the DAO was to lock its remaining BPT & AURA holdings now, the weekly emissions value generated would be ~ $10,8K / week.\n\n## Improvement scenarios\n\nWhile an increase can be observed (7,7k to10,8k/week), the maximum emissions can still be improved, either by optimizing or increasing and diversifying the exposure. The tables below show an emission power overview post AIP-42 for both cases.\n\nThe current situation would also require to vote on both layers, which complexifies the management, however this option will be possible as Llama’s SAM contract upgrade ARFC to support both veBAL & vlAURA, and propose to grant the asset manager role to the committee will be published in the coming days (code currently in review by BGD).\n\nAs described in both options above, the goal of this ARFC is to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA units, either with BPT or with stables. The Option 3 proposed in the comments aims to find a compromise for all stakeholders by acquiring ~ 950K AURA units and staking BPT holdings.\n\n### 1) Convert to remaining BPT to AURA\n\nThis option considers optimizing the current holding by selling the remaining BPT for AURA, which will improve the gauge power owned without spending more funds to increase the exposure value.\n\nDespite proposing to convert BPT, Balancer remains a strategic partner and this acquisition will actually enable the DAO to grow more liquidity on Balancer, and partially support the SM strategy once live, creating an important amount of bribes for veBAL holders.\n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA, the weekly emissions value would currently be ~ $20,1K / week (almost twice the current situation including votes on both layers).\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Maximal emission power (Full vlAURA)\n- No extra investment (BPT conversion)\n- Simple management (Vote on one layer only)\n- Less locking restrictions (No decay & 4 months lock)\n- Will enable to grow more liqudity on Balancer\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Sell BPT acquired to lock veBAL according to the partnership (limited price impact)\n- Can be considered as unfair for veBAL holders who supported GHO at launch\n- Balancer DAO might sell the AAVE acquired during the TokenSwap\n\n### 2) Keep remaining BPT & acquire AURA to lock both\n\nAfter receiving some feedback including concerns about selling BPT (initially acquired before AIP-42 at the Balancer partnership to lock for veBAL), this option considers to retain the BPT for veBAL and acquire additional ~ 1,3M AURA to lock for vlAURA with stables from the treasury which increases both the emission power & the exposure value.\n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 1,3M AURA with stables and lock the remaining BPT holdings, the weekly emissions value generated would be ~ $25,7K / week.\n\nWhile this improves weekly emissions by $5,6K, this strategy is less efficient compared to the above as it would complexify the management with the need to vote on both layers (one on-chain, one off-chain), relock the veBAL holdings, manage the two voting periods (weeks/rounds), and cost an extra $1M in stables from the DAO treasury.\n\n#### Pros:\n- Increased overall emission power of the Aave DAO (veBAL + vlAURA)\n- Favor good relations with Balancer by following the initial partnership proposal.\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- $1M extra investment (AURA acquisition with stables)\n- More complex management (Vote on two different layers)\n- Includes veBAL restrictions (Voting power decay & up to 1 year lock)\n- Emission power not fully optimized\n\n*(Despite its maximal estimated efficiency, there isn’t an option to convert both BPT holdings + $1M for AURA as this amount would be complex to acquire with the current liquidity available)*\n\n### 3) Mint auraBAL & use BAL, use USDC/AAVE rewards for bribes & lock AURA rewards + Acquire $800K of AURA\n\nThis was initially suggested by Karpatkey in the comments, and updated to this revised option which aims to find a good compromise for all stakeholders.  \n\nThe major update is the consideration of the classic auraBAL staking to allocate BPT instead of converting it to AURA. This strategy earns 18% APR in BAL + AUR, which can be used to create bribes & compensate for the reduced acquisition. \n\nAURA can be accumulated to be locked for vlAURA, and the amount can be replaced with USDC/AAVE to maintain the rewards value which will be used for bribes with the BAL. \n\nThis also reduces the AURA market buy from $1M stables (in Option 1 & 2) to 800K$ in the Option 3: \n- $400K on market (400K USDC) \n- $200K token swap with the Aura DAO (2950 AAVE)\n- $200K OTC Deal with AEF & Contributors (200K USDC)\n\n* Emission power with vlAURA to be acquired: \n\nIf the DAO was to acquire ~ 950K AURA as described above, in addition to 440K acquired from Olympus, the weekly emissions value would be ~ $16,2K / week.\n\n* Emission power with auraBAL staking rewards used for bribes: \n\nIf the DAO was to stake all the auraBAL minted with BPT in the classic staking, the weekly rewards would be ~ $5,4K / week. Assuming a weekly vlAURA bribe cost of $0,007 / week,  ~ $8,9K / week can be obtained in emissions. \n\nOption 3 Total weekly emissions: $16,2K + $8,9K =  $25,2K / week\n\n#### Pros:\n\n- Mint & stake auraBAL instead of selling BPTs\n- Very good emission power (vlAURA votes & bribes)\n- Simple management (Vote & bribe on one layer only)\n- Less locking restrictions (No veBAL decay & 4 months lock)\n- Reduce AURA amount to acquire on market ($400K vs $1,1M)\n- AURA long term accumulation (rewards replaced for bribes)\n- Increase veBAL/vlAURA ratio\n- 1,4M vlAURA locked & 157k BPT staked ( good for Aura)\n\n#### Cons:\n\n- Complexify the strategy implementation (where to stake auraBAL to be defined)\n- Complexify rewards management (AURA to be lock, BAL + equiv USDC for bribes)\n- Requires a $800K extra investment (including $200K in AAVE & $600K in USDC)\n- Low liquidity & trading volume on auraBAL\n\nIn terms of emission value, the revised Option 3 proposed is similar to Option 2, which was the highest amount proposed ($25,7K vs $25,2K weekly).\n\n# Acquisition details\n\nRegardless of which option above is voted on the ARFC, the proposal is to acquire AURA with USDC on market to reduce the price impact. If anyone reading this is interested in selling AURA OTC, feel free to comment.\n\nSome Aura contributors & the Aura Ecosystem Fund Committee proposed a 200k AURA OTC deal for USDC (available on September 29th), using a TWAP price from the ARFC forum (posted on September 26th with Snapshot vote starting on September 29th) until snapshot vote ended if approved (October 4th).\n\nOverview of the AEF deal using the current AURA price to facilitate estimations but may vary depending on the TWAP price:\n\nThe optimal way to execute these market transactions seems to be using the TWAP orders from Cowswap to split the trades into several orders.\n\nWhile the price impact of selling the remaining BPT for USDC in one transaction is limited (3,5%), this can be reduced to 2,2% with a split of 5 orders. For AURA, the price impact if acquired in one transaction is quite important (42%), but this can also be reduced to 5,7% with a split of 10 orders.\n\n# Specifications\n\nOTC acquisition: If the Aura contributors & AEF deal is approved, the 200k OTC can be implemented using a similar contract to the one used for the Olympus deal (only difference being the price defined with a TWAP). This AIP execution should fall under ACI’s Skyward program scope.\n\nMarket acquisition: As AURA are likely to be mostly bought on market using TWAP orders which can be used with a Safe, the AURA buy and potential BPT sell can be executed by the GHO liquidity committee using the multisig once live (require a fallback handler on it). \n\nThis should simplify the acquisition compared to creating new contracts for this purpose. More information on TWAP orders can be found here.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf Option 1:\n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for AEF OTC deal\n- (AIP) Transfer all BPT from the collector to the committee multisig\n- Committee start TWAP orders BPT for USDC\n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer back USDC equivalent for OTC deal on the Collector\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\nIf Option 2:\n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for Aura deal\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to the committee multisig\n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\nIf Option 3: \n\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to OTC contract for AEF deal\n- (AIP) Transfer AAVE from the ecosystem reserve to tokenswap contract for Aura deal\n- (AIP) Transfer USDC from the collector to the committee multisig for market buy \n- Committee start TWAP orders USDC for AURA\n- Committee transfer AURA on the SAM contract to lock once deployed\n\n## Voting Options TLDR \n\n- YAE (Option 1): Convert BPT for AURA to lock vlAURA \n- YAE (Option 2): Lock BPT for veBAL + buy AURA ($1M in USDC) to lock vlAURA\n- YAE (Option 3): Mint auraBAL with BPT & use rewards for bribes + buy AURA ($800k in USDC & AAVE) to lock vlAURA \n- NAY: Do nothing \n- ABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\nThis ARFC can be useful to pending proposals from SPs but is published on my own initiative and is not receiving any compensation.
