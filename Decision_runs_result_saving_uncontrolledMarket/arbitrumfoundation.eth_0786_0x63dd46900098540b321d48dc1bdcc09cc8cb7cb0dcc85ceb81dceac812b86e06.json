This DAO elected council will be made of experienced members to join a collaborative brain trust that advises and oversees the GCP. \n\nCouncil members will leverage their deep DAO governance experience, industry knowledge and financial expertise to guide the programâ€™s strategic direction and ensure the utmost transparency to the Arbitrum DAO. \n\nPlease see the [candidate thread](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/gcp-council-nominations/25093/24) for details associated with each candidate nomination.\n\nWe strive to be thoughtful during the voting processes to ensure that a range of skills and expertise are represented on the GCP Council. To that end, all Nominees should be evaluated based on their ability to contribute to a well-balanced council.\n\n#### Please note:\n* This election is for **three open** seats on the GCP Council.\n* All applicants were asked to specify a single domain for the election. For instance, a DAO member with both venture capital and technology experience should choose the domain that best represents their primary focus for the election. \n* Domains are additional information for the DAO to select a well balanced council and are not requirements to be represented in the overall council. (the DAO can vote for two members of one domain, and/or no members for another domain)\n* Applicants are grouped by domain to encourage well-balanced voting and to ensure the council has a diverse set of skills.\n* We have [two](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/nominated-gaming-venture-council-members/25075/3) Council Members chosen by the GCP working group with deep experience in games oriented venture capital and business development that will be going through a re-confirmation vote later this year.\n\nThis election structure is weighted, meaning delegates may allocate their voting power to several candidates.\n\n#### Meet your GCP Council Nominees:\n\n#### Domain: Governance Expert\n* Immutable Lawyer [Gov Exp]\n* CoinflipCanada [Gov Exp]\n* C.J. Bzdewka [Gov Exp]\n* Mona El Isa [Gov Exp]\n* Devansh Mehta [Gov Exp]\n* Kristoffer DW [Gov Exp]\n\n#### Domain: Growth / BD Expert\n* David Bolger [Growth / BD Exp]\n* John Kennedy [Growth / BD Exp]\n* Rich Cabrera [Growth / BD Exp]\n* Ali Husain [Growth / BD Exp]\n* Amar Bedi [Growth / BD Exp]\n\n#### Domain: Player Engagement Expert\n* Enric Pedro [Player Eng Exp]\n\n####  Domain: Operations / Games Expert\n* Greg Canessa [Ops Exp]\n* David Plisek [Ops Exp]\n\n#### Domain: Venture / Games Expert\n* Sam Saliba [Venture Exp]\n* Adam Dawson [Venture Exp]\n* Karthik Raju [Venture Exp]",
