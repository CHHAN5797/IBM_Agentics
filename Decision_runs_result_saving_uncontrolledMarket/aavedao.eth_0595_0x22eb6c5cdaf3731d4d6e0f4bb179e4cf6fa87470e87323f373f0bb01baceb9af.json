Key focus areas include asset onboarding, additional money markets, new risk management features, and supporting community initiatives.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave protocol is evolving rapidly with new features, integrations, assets, and markets. Aave users and token holders rely on the protocol to operate securely and safeguard the funds deposited in Aave markets and the safety module. Committed professional analysis will help governance and the community mitigate risk and take advantage of new opportunities with greater confidence. \n\nThe Risk DAO will initially focus on the following areas:\nReviewing proposed new assets for technical and market risks\nFacilitating community discussions through biweekly risk calls\nBuilding dashboards and tooling to help increase understanding of Aave protocol risk factors\nEvaluating markets for cross chain deployments or new asset types\nCommenting on community led initiatives that affect protocol risk\n\nRefer to the [Aave governance forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-aave-risk-dao/4729) for additional details on Risk DAO scope and priorities.\n\nThe Risk DAO will seek to work collaboratively with Gauntlet Network, which recently received [approval](https://app.aave.com/governance/25-QmcbpNrBCbJcQiyEgHpeE1D9PajYd9D8iCwbAt7mFGngmS) for dynamic risk parameter management of the primary Aave v2 money market on Ethereum mainnet. Gauntlet’s engagement will allow the Risk DAO to focus on other important priorities for Aave risk management. We will remain open to opportunities for collaboration with Gauntlet and other Aave contributors including the Aave Grants DAO.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe Aave Risk DAO will be funded for an initial operating period of 3 months (12 weeks). At the conclusion of this period, the community can review performance and determine next steps for extending the program. \n\n### Initial contributors: \n\n**Project management and governance**\nmonet-supply\n\n**Market risk and analytics**\nThomas\nJack\nRoberto\nJeremy\n\n**Technical risk**\nMateusz\n\n**Real world asset risk**\nWill\n\n**Student contributors**\nMembers of Blockchain at Berkeley\n\nMembers will post short introductions below. Additional contributors may be onboarded to the Risk DAO as needed with mutual agreement of existing members, with any new contributors providing introduction details and falling under the existing Risk DAO budget outlined below.\n\n### Budget\n\n**Contributor Payments**\n\nTechnical Risk - 10 hours per week at $225/hour\nMarket Risk and Analytics - 30 hours per week at $200/hour\nReal World Asset Risk - 10 hours per week at $225/hour\nProject Management and Governance - 10 hours per week at $100/hour\nStudent Contributors - 15 hours per week at $100/hour\n\nTotal: $156,000 over 3 months ($13,000 per week)\n\n**Miscellaneous Expenses**\n\nThis budget category includes spending on software, infrastructure, and other miscellaneous expenses. The Risk DAO will submit an invoice detailing itemized costs and descriptions for any miscellaneous expenses on a monthly basis.\n\nTotal: $30,000 over 3 months\n\n**Grand total: $186,000 over 3 months**\n\n### Payout Mechanism\n\nWe will establish a multisig wallet to hold operational funding for the Aave Risk DAO. The multisig will require 4 of 6 signers to move funds or take other action. The proposed signers are listed below:\n\nMonetsupply (Risk DAO contributor)\nTom Borgers (Risk DAO contributor)\nJack Clancy (Risk DAO contributor)\nNick Cannon (Gauntlet)\nJohn Morrow (Gauntlet)\n1 additional Aave community member (TBD)\n\nDue to potential price volatility between proposal submission and final approval, the Risk DAO is requesting $204,600 worth of AAVE tokens (final amount of tokens to be determined based on AAVE price when on-chain proposal is submitted), representing a 10% surplus buffer over the stated budget. Funds will be converted by the multisig to stablecoins (DAI or USDC) when received, to minimize volatility and avoid funding shortfalls.\n\nEach month, the multisig will transfer payments to Risk DAO contributors for the upcoming month. In addition, the multisig will transfer reimbursements for any miscellaneous expenses incurred over the previous month. \n\nAt the conclusion of the 3 month period, the multisig will return any unused funds to Aave governance. Additionally, Aave governance may request early termination of the Risk DAO and return of funds via the AIP process.\n\nRisk DAO contributors who are reconfirmed for a new term of membership at the end of this period should be eligible for a 10% bonus paid in AAVE tokens, calculated based on their total compensation earned over the 3 month initial period covered by this proposal. This bonus payment is contingent on renewal by Aave governance, so the necessary funds would be requested in a future proposal.\n\n**Proposal transaction(s):** \n\nTransfer $204,600 worth of AAVE tokens from ecosystem reserve to the Risk DAO multisig\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## Summary\nChaos Labs proposes to expand the scope of its engagement with Aave to include proactive risk analysis and management of the v2 markets while encouraging and supporting a safe migration to the upcoming Ethereum v3 deployment.\n\nThe current engagement is focused on providing risk analyses and parameter recommendations across only v3 markets ([Discussion link](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025)). With the recent volatility in the markets and attempted exploit through the CRV pool, our resources have shifted to supporting Aave v2 on Ethereum, as well, to ensure protocol stability and security.\n\nWe wanted to put this a community vote and formalize coverage and expectations around Chaos’ work on this instance and support during the launch and transition towards v3 on relevant protocols.\n\n## Background\nChaos Labs was approved as a risk partner for Aave v3 earlier last month and have begun work to launch the [Community Parameter Recommendations](https://governance.aave.com/t/updated-proposal-chaos-labs-risk-simulation-platform/10025/19)  in the coming weeks covering all relevant v3 markets across LTV, Liquidation Threshold, Liquidation Bonus, and Supply/Borrow Caps with other metrics coming shortly thereafter.\n\nAs liquidity in DeFi has dried up and volatility in non-pegged assets has increased, the risk situation for Aave v2 has become a greater concern to the community, with more surface area to be covered. It was not our intention to cover v2 during this engagement, as we were heads down and focused on v3. As the market volatility picked up, Chaos was asked (both publicly and privately) for our analysis of the state of the protocol to support and help minimize the risk of additional bad debt accrued to the protocol. Through the forum discussions around the appropriate risk response to the existing market factors, we aligned with the community that not all markets needed to be frozen, and there was a path forward with mitigated parameters, which we stepped in to propose in order to allow the community to have a voice both in the forums and via governance votes. All have passed with a significant show of support.\n\nWe are still iterating and publishing the amended parameters for v2 in line with those early proposals and have begun discussions analyzing the most appropriate path to transition usage to v3.\n\nThrough our first month as a contributor, we have coordinated with other DAO contributors to submit several risk proposals, including:\n\n- [v3 Supply Cap Recommendations for Uncapped Assets (Fast-track)](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf40a7b4a6ecd5325553593f0f9fdc8ba04808573fdf76fc277aee52b5396a588)\n- [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool (AIP 125)](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=125)\n- [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LT and LTV (2022.12.01)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lt-and-ltv-2022-12-01/10897)\n- [V3 Borrow Cap Recommendations (Fast-track) (2022-12-05)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-v3-borrow-cap-recommendations-fast-track-2022-12-05/10927)\n- [Risk Parameter Updates for Aave v2 Ethereum - LTs and LTVs for Long Tail Assets (2022.12.04)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-updates-for-aave-v2-ethereum-lts-and-ltvs-for-long-tail-assets-2022-12-04/10926)\n\nAdditionally, we have published research on a number of topics to help inform community discussion:\n\n- [v2 Liquidation Threshold impact analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-risk-parameter-recommendations-for-aave-v2-eth-2022-11-22/10757/30)\n- [BTC vs. WBTC Oracle Analysis](https://governance.aave.com/t/wbtcs-and-others-pricing-mechanism-on-aave/10825/6)\n- [Chaos Labs Asset Protection Tool](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/chaos-labs-asset-protection-tool)\n\nAave v2 is the only instance of the protocol live on Ethereum mainnet today, while the development for v3 to launch is ongoing. Usage capabilities of Aave v2 have been curtailed significantly, first by freezing several assets and subsequently unfreezing a portion of them to allow for supplying of “risky assets” and enabling borrows for well-structured “pegged assets.”\n\nThe transition to Aave v3 on mainnet will not be entirely seamless and will require the support of all contributors and community members to ensure it goes as smoothly as possible.\n\n## Proposal\n#### Scope\n\nBased on the work done to date in a short time frame and the amount of work ahead to transition from v2 to v3 on Ethereum, Chaos Labs is proposing to extend the scope of the original engagement to support parameter optimization on v2 as well as conduct relevant risk analyses during the transition planning.\n\nOur priority with this added scope would be to methodically update parameters, protect existing user funds, and mitigate new potential risk factors on v2 while ensuring the capital efficiency of v3 is a more attractive option for new users.\n\nThis includes topics and considerations such as:\n\nMethodically amending asset parameters to incentivize new users to open accounts on v3\nInitiating coordination with third-party protocols building on top of v2 to assist in transition planning, communications, and timing\nHelping analyze incentive (both treasury- and parameter-managed) schemes to incite account transitions\nContinued analysis of the impact of market events and risk scenarios for the DAO\nThis work will be in conjunction with our existing v3 responsibilities and should not materially impact timelines for delivery during the coming months.\n\n### Duration: \nWe propose this engagement to align with the 6-month anniversary of our original engagement, thus covering the remaining 5-month period. The intent is to bridge the transition from v2 to v3 during this period with a finite end date and not continue on indefinitely. If there is still material TVL on v2 at the end of this period, we will discuss the appropriate next steps and maintenance/monitoring expectations with the community.\n\n### Compensation: \n$250k streamed linearly over the 5-month period (equating to $50k per month).\n- 30% ($75k) payable in AAVE tokens\n- 70% ($175k) in stablecoins",

        "title": "Deploy Aave V3 to Metis Andromeda Mainnet",
        "author": "0x070341aA5Ed571f0FB2c4a5641409B1A46b4961b",
        "body": "Summary\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.\n\nProposal: About Metis\nBorn out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top-notch scalability; built-in on-chain credentials through Nuvo, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling Web3 and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nAndromeda network utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereum’s underlying security. Currently, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitalik’s proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a first-of-its-kind Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollup’s security with plasma’s scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next business verticals.\n\nOur second vertical is Nuvo, a Web3 identity system providing infrastructure to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain credentials: portable and composable credentials earned through on-chain achievements and history. Soulbound tokens will allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren’t previously available for Web3. Nuvo also offers a state-of-the-art cross-chain wallet, enabling account abstraction and several benefits for users. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long-term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 organizations looking to transition into Web3 without facing a substantial UI change.\n\nThird, Koris: tooling and infrastructure for DAOs, and soon, seamless onboarding of Web2 to Web3 through our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework. Koris provides tooling and infrastructure for DAOs to perform their day-to-day operations in a more efficient manner and will allow Web2 organizations to create and tailor DACs to their preference.\n\nWhen combining all these components, Metis Andromeda will create a framework for open, decentralized, and trustless collaboration between individuals, dApps, and Web2 organizations transitioning to Web3. All the functionalities enabled by on-chain credentials, the scalability provided by the base Layer 2, and the tooling provided by Koris’ operational system. The perfect suite for dApps, Web2 platforms, or any builder.\n\nMetisDAO Foundation announced earlier this month its upcoming transition to a Hybrid Rollup, either late 2023, or early 2024. This architecture will combine the EVM Compatibility and fast transaction confirmation of Optimistic Rollups, with the censorship-resistance, security, and fast transaction finality enabled by zero-knowledge proofs. Logically, this will be a huge step to secure the Decentralized Finance applications of the network, and provide a very robust base layer for the Web3 Economy.\n\nCommitted to supporting our ecosystem builders and seeing them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can fund projects in 3 main ways:\nBuilder Mining Rewards\nEcosystem Grants \nGenesi DAC Investments\n*The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices).\n\nAs we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting decentralized finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets in support of the Web3 economy we are building towards. Through this integration, Aave can also obtain additional revenue through protocol fees as well as through the Metis Builder Mining Program. \n\nMetis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future on Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a strong DeFi ecosystem, and there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, but having a Flagship protocol like Aave has always been our end goal in the realm of money markets. The deployment would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while also complementing Aave’s multichain expansion. \nTechnical Evaluation by BGD\nIn the spirit of security and transparency, Metis worked alongside BGD (Bored Ghosts Developing) to perform a technical evaluation on the Andromeda network. The evaluation consisted of 13 categories, with 4 different possible scores: Optimal, Good, Acceptable, and Needs Improvement. Each of the categories scored as follows:\n\nOracle Infrastructure: Optimal\nBlockchain Explorer: Good\nCompatibility with Ethereum RPC standard: Optimal\nCompatibility with Ethereum account format (addresses): Optimal\nRPC public endpoints and providers: Acceptable\nCustom behavior (lack of) the execution layer: Optimal\nSupport of wallet providers: Good\nOn-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Good\nTransactions simulation infrastructure (fork): Good\nChain data/indexing solutions: Acceptable\nBridging infrastructure: asset, messages: Optimal\nCommitment in security-incidents: Optimal\nNetwork security/technical model: Good\n\n*RPC public endpoints and providers: We integrated Bware services in order to increase the variety of RPC alternatives in the network. We are also in talks with other top tier providers to further bolster our RPC infrastructure. We were in communication with BGD throughout this process to ensure the providers we chose met their technical standards.\n*Chain data/indexing solutions: We’re currently finalizing talks with a top data indexing platform in order to enable the right tooling and services in the ecosystem.\n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-metis-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/11374\n\nRisk Parameter Setting and Asset Listing with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet\nGauntlet and Chaos Labs collaborated to provide a risk analysis and recommendations for the deployment of the Metis Andromeda network. We will follow the recommendations of these trusted risk parties for Aave, for setting both the risk parameters as well as the assets to be listed. \n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-v3-on-metis/7056/61?u=metis\n\n\nIncentivized Adoption\n\nWe are excited to propose a 100,000 Metis token liquidity incentivization campaign throughout a six month period shortly following deployment. We will be working with Chaos Labs to map out the most strategic allocation of these incentives to bolster strong market depth and sticky liquidity, ensuring to follow best industry practices and monitoring the efficacy in real time.\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nAssuming a passed deployment vote, we will coordinate with BGD to begin the Aave deployment process and implementation. We expect this process to take roughly four weeks. After the subsequent launch of Aave V3 on Metis, we will monitor the activity and launch the aforementioned liquidity mining incentive program. We will continue to stay in close communication with Chaos Labs and Gauntlet to keep a watchful eye on liquidity levels and inflows, to ensure proposed increases in market caps, congruent with increased liquidity depth on-chain. We look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with and provide value to both the Aave DAO and community at large, as well as the entire Metis ecosystem.",
