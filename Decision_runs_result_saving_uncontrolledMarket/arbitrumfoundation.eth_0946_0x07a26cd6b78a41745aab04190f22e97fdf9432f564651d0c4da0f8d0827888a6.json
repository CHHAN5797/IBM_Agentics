        "body": "**Non-Constitutional Proposal**\n\n**AUTHORS**\n[Iron Boots](https://twitter.com/SirBootsOfIron) (BD Lead), [Myrddin](https://twitter.com/0xmyrddin) (Dev Lead)\n\n...\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis post proposes granting 1.5M ARB per month to Camelot DAO for the next 6 months to fund liquidity incentives for Arbitrum-focused projects on Camelot, including the onboarding of new and multi-chain protocols entering the ecosystem. Camelot strives to support the native ecosystem through collaborative relationships and has a proven track record of allocating incentives to enable sustainable growth and long-term liquidity for ecosystem protocols. This proposal will therefore support deeper spot liquidity for Arbitrum native builders, as well as supporting integration partners and the launch of new protocols, thereby enabling significant growth through an approach that prioritizes Arbitrum’s core values. Most importantly, this will further the adoption of ARB as a base asset within liquidity pools and partner integrations.\n\n...\n\n## Motivation\n\nCamelot is not just a DEX - it’s the infrastructure that enables native protocols to build sustainable and efficient liquidity. As Arbitrum’s first major native DEX, Camelot strives to support the ecosystem with a long-term and collaborative approach that moves beyond the traditional role of DEXs as simple ‘yield farms’.\n\nIn just over 6 months of being live, Camelot has achieved over $2,500,000,000 total volume traded, highs of $100m TVL, and the successful onboarding of countless protocols to the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Round Table is the hub for Camelot’s official long-term partners, and the initial members consisted of the core Arbitrum protocols such as Vela, Jones, Pendle, Plutus, GMX, Sperax, and more. On average, Round Table partners have over 90% of their total DEX liquidity and volume on Camelot.\n\nSince then, the Round Table now consists of over 25 official partner protocols, and through its launchpad Camelot has supported over 9 protocols to raise funds in a community-focused and decentralized way. Most importantly, Camelot is home to numerous community builders that leverage the custom-built features to manage their liquidity, with a combined reach of over 40 native protocols present on Camelot and over 15 integrations being built on top of its infrastructure. Camelot is one of the most used dapps in the ecosystem, with over 300,000 unique users since launch. Camelot is not a fork, and is custom-built code that has been thoroughly tested and audited by Paladin. In addition, Camelot has no private investors and was launched in a truly community-focused and decentralized way. The ownership of Camelot has been spread through the key Arbitrum players, thereby making the protocol truly part of the ecosystem and community.\n\nThis grant would have a significant impact on the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem in several ways:\n\n* Deep spot liquidity is the foundation for DeFi protocols to thrive, enabling further innovation and use cases for Arbitrum native protocols. For example, deeper spot liquidity unlocks the potential for tokens to be used in lending markets, options and perps protocols, structured products, and much more. Whilst other DEXs also tackle this for blue chip tokens, Camelot is uniquely positioned to most effectively support the native ecosystem builders. This proposal will specifically focus on Arbitrum protocols throughout their lifecycle, whilst leveraging the network and community of Camelot to generate sustainable growth with real users. Deepening pools that already have significant liquidity is not our only focus, as Camelot is positioned to ensure the distribution of ARB tokens materializes into a stronger ecosystem. Most importantly, Camelot can work with partners to pair their tokens with ARB as a base asset. This will advance ARB as a foundational asset of the ecosystem, providing it with direct value and utility.\n\n* Camelot has a proven track record of effectively allocating rewards in a sustainable and economical way. Therefore, not only will this grant proposal deepen liquidity, it will also ensure that the most active and aligned builders on Arbitrum directly benefit from it too. As an ecosystem hub for native builders, Camelot will leverage this grant to support and incentivise new protocols launching in the ecosystem, further cementing Arbitrum’s position as the go-to layer 2 for innovation and DeFi. Through its launchpad and network of Round Table partners, Camelot additionally offers protocols marketing, BD, and general support.\n\n* In addition to liquidity, Camelot is one of the largest Arbitrum governance delegates and has continued to foster collaboration in the ecosystem. Therefore, this proposal would also focus on integration partners that enable more efficient liquidity management and further use cases. These protocols also build on top of our partner liquidity pools, therefore multiplying the network effects of the allocated Arb incentives. Camelot currently has over 15 integration partners, ranging from advanced liquidity management apps, leveraged yield farming, derivatives, structured products, and more.\n\n...\n\n## Rationale\n\nCamelot was conceived to help deliver Arbitrum’s goal of scaling and revolutionizing the future of Ethereum. Through its commitment to supporting native builders, Camelot strives to build the foundation of sustainable liquidity and collaboration that will allow Arbitrum and its diverse ecosystem to thrive.\n\nSince its inception in December 2022, Camelot has maintained a robust upward trajectory, steered by a long-term, sustainable incentives approach. We've avoided the common pitfalls of being a ‘yield-farm for mercenary capital,’ and our proven track record of allocating incentives effectively to yield maximum returns for our community, protocol, and ecosystem stands testament to our potential. We plan to harness the power of Arbitrum grant incentives to maintain this growth trajectory.\n\nThough past performance doesn't necessarily predict future success, it does offer valuable insights into the potential of this proposal. Over the period from December 2022 to May 2023, Camelot experienced an impressive average monthly increase in volume and Total Value Locked (TVL) of 275% and 79% respectively. Even more noteworthy is that during this period, Camelot generated over $10m in protocol fees, with a significant proportion of these channelled back to our token holders. This strongly suggests that, with the additional Arbitrum incentives, we can stimulate significant growth and capture substantial long-term value across a large number of native protocols. Moreover, we can achieve this while ensuring a decentralized and sustainable token ownership distribution. Camelot also received an airdrop of over 2,000,000 ARB, which has so far been fully dedicated to being an active governance participant.\n\nTo allocate the Arbitrum incentives even more effectively we will distribute it across 4 different categories: Ecosystem Builders, Integration Partners, Core Pairs, and Liquid Staking Derivatives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicjatrrpsk2u22lkmiqwklpmnk5jqkacc45odyf7npqib3hrgydse)    \n\n### Ecosystem Builders\n\nCamelot is home to many of Arbitrum’s favourite protocols, and this category will distribute incentives to builders that are fully aligned with Camelot’s approach to sustainable liquidity and long-term collaboration. As detailed in the ‘Specifications’ section below, Camelot is one of the most effective hubs to distribute incentives, due to the large and expansive network of long-term partners.\n\n### Integration Partners\n\nBy providing incentives to partners that are building on top of Camelot’s infrastructure, we are diversifying the use of incentives to fuel even further innovation and growth that benefits all partners and the broader ecosystem, whilst also deepening the underlying liquidity at the same time. These partners would include concentrated liquidity managers, leveraged yield protocols, lending markets, liquidity management dapps and more.\n\n### Core pairs\n\nWhilst Camelot’s primary focus is on the native Arbitrum builders, ensuring Camelot can offer deep liquidity for the most actively traded tokens like ETH and USDC is also important as the native DEX. With the number of protocols actively building on Camelot, deep liquidity for core pairs will be an important piece to ensure we have a strong foundation that can expand to longer-tail tokens too.\n\n### Liquid staked derivatives\n\nLiquid staked derivatives are seeing rapid growth as they unlock significant liquidity on Ethereum whilst securing the network at the same time. The majority of LSD liquidity is currently on Ethereum, and we think it’s an important catalyst for the broader Arbitrum ecosystem to support LSD adoption natively too. Deeper LSD liquidity will allow Arbitrum native builders to tap into a highly productive asset to build on top of, leading to further growth, utility, and products for the ecosystem.\n\n### Velodrome on Optimism as Precedent\n\nWhile Arbitrum is a unique ecosystem which is difficult to compare to other networks, the effect of Optimism’s grant to Velodrome in July of 2022 supports that a similar grant to Camelot could have a positive effect on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Velodrome received a 3M OP grant from the Optimism Foundation in July of 2022 that was meant to last 4-5 months. As seen in the visual below, Velodrome had around $14M in TVL, generated around $3.3k in weekly fees, and had $2M in daily volume before the grant. In the last 3 months, Camelot has averaged over $80M in TVL, $450,000 in weekly fees, and $18M in daily volume. While TVL and volume numbers can be skewed by low fee-generating mercenary TVL, fees paid are less biased, and Camelot has been earning over 100x more fees than Velodrome before incentives.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreidwm2wtosajdmpiqyryhwv3wvbrr634fp2zavgebk5z7jjl6igwdu)    \n\nCamelot has surpassed Velodrome by nearly every metric by using novel, long-term emission incentives. Thus, we’re asking for 1.5M ARB per month vs Velodrome’s 3M OP over 4-5 months. Because Camelot is currently in a much better position than pre-grant Velodrome, we expect that the ARB grant will increase liquidity depth on Camelot and the general ecosystem expansion even more, supercharging the network to a new level.\n\nTo provide additional perspective, the Arbitrum DAO treasury currently holds 3,527,046,084 ARB tokens. Assuming a hypothetical 10-year runway of treasury spending, this would be equivalent to 352m ARB tokens a year. Camelot’s grant proposal for a total of 9m ARB tokens would therefore represent 2.56% of the annual budget, with the expectation of significant ecosystem growth and expansion.\n\n***Camelot TVL, Volume and Fees before ARB Grant***\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflwh7et2aybm4bhk2aunxtlloz6h3yxtxdd4gffgawyhajcno4l4)\n\n...\n\n## Specifications\n\nCamelot will distribute 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month as incentives across a broad range of Arbitrum liquidity pools and integrations. The distribution of these incentives will adhere to the Proposal Objectives, the proposal parameters, and the Transparency Report. \n\nThe transparency report will ensure that Camelot has clearly documented where every $ARB token has been allocated, the relevant growth metrics achieved, and most importantly the progress for its broader Arbitrum objectives. You can see the objectives and parameters below and a template of the transparency report attached. This report will be provided at the latest 72 hrs before the following month’s incentives are to be distributed.\n\n### Proposal Objectives\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* To grow the liquidity of Arbitrum builders, bringing new users into the ecosystem and directly supporting the growth of ecosystem protocols\n* To use the incentives to bring new protocols into the Arbitrum ecosystem\n* To support the launch of native builders and their liquidity requirements\n* To advance the adoption of ARB as a base asset in liquidity pools\n* To advance the adoption of ARB within integration partner strategies\n* To provide marketing and community support to the ecosystem builders included in the incentive programme\n\n### Proposal Parameters\n*(As measured and tracked within the transparency report, attached below)*\n\n* Incentives will be distributed to a minimum of 30 partner pools, as documented in the transparency report. Any new pool or integration needs to be clearly documented beforehand in the transparency report.\n* No single pool or partner (excluding core $ARB pools) can receive more than 5% of the total incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* No single pool or integration partner can receive more than 5% of its TVL in monthly incentives (as measured over a 30-day period)\n* A pool must maintain a minimum trading volume of $1,000,000 annualized to be valid to receive rewards (as measured over a 30-day period).\n* A minimum of 33% of the total incentives will be used on liquidity pools with $ARB as the base asset. On top of this minimum, Camelot will provide bonus incentives to teams that actively transition their liquidity to ARB as a base asset too. This will be included and measured within the aforementioned transparency report.\n* The partner integration section has now been merged into the “Ecosystem Builders” section, with the relevant parameters above being applicable.\n* If at any point the Arbitrum community or DAO is not satisfied with the performance or delivery, they can move forward with a governance vote to end the grant early.\n\nCamelot will distribute the incentives across the following categories and pools detailed below. The distribution across these various pools will adhere to the Proposal Objectives and parameters, please reference the transparency report for a more in-depth breakdown:\n\n[TRANSPARENCY REPORT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifbxdwctnf335rkwqpw7k5dejulbgc3wbcmjxew45pkxxttyamhrq)\n\n* Ecosystem Builders 75%\n  * Liquidity incentives for partner pools such as Vela, Pendle, Plutus, Jones and a diverse range of Arbitrum protocols. This will include integration partners that build on top of Camelot liquidity pools, such as Gamma and DeFi Edge, following the same parameters and guidelines shared above.\n  * The transparency report contains a broader breakdown of the ecosystem pools that this will be focused on. In addition, these incentives will be used to encourage the adoption of ARB as a base asset for ecosystem protocol liquidity pools.\n\n* Core Pairs 15%\n  * These represent the core liquidity pools such as ARB/ETH, ETH/USDC, and USDC/USDC. Further examples are included in the transparency report.\n\n* Liquid Staking Derivatives 10%\n  * Focusing on a diverse range of LSDs, most of which have little liquidity on Arbitrum. This will therefore target protocols such as unshETH, Lido, Rocket Pool, Swell, Stafi and more.\n\nCamelot will utilize its Nitro Pools technology to release the granted ARB in combination with $GRAIL and $xGRAIL emissions to liquidity providers. Nitro Pools are custom-built permissionless solutions to distribute incentives to any liquidity pool, with the ability to add custom requirements also. Along with the rest of the protocol, Nitro Pools have been audited by Paladin, and used by Camelot and numerous partners over the previous 8 months.\n\n\n...\n\n## Steps to implement\n\nCamelot will receive 1,5000,000 monthly over a period of 6 months, for a total of 9m ARB. In order to most transparently receive the tokens requested, Camelot will use a new multisig that will have several ecosystem players from other Arbitrum protocols. The makeup of this multisig, including the protocol affiliation(s) of each signer will be made public upon the creation of the multisig (before the proposal is moved to snapshot), and all changes to the makeup of the multisig will be announced in advance. This multisig will be governed by a multisig participation agreement wherein each signer will agree to use their signing authority only to further the interest of the wallet itself, using the ARB tokens to incentivise liquidity in approved nitro pools. By structuring the multi-sig with signers representative of the broader Arbitrum ecosystem, Camelot will ensure that the ARB tokens granted by the Arbitrum DAO will be leveraged to support new protocols, DAOs, and projects that are broadly value additive for Arbitrum.\n\nCamelot currently has [2,189,094 ARB tokens](https://debank.com/profile/0x03ff2d78afb69e0859ec6beb4cf107d3741e97ab) in its treasury, which it has used entirely for governance purposes. As an additional safeguard and sign of assurance, Camelot commits to placing its own ARB into the grant multisig for the duration of the 6 month proposal, therefore at any given time, Camelot will have “guaranteed” more ARB than it would receive from the Arbitrum DAO. Once the grant is over, Camelot will receive its own 2,189,094 ARB tokens back.\n\nOnce the ARB tokens have been distributed to the intended multisig wallet, Camelot will bear the full responsibility and workload to ensure the effective allocation of these tokens. Camelot will actively manage and continuously analyze the effectiveness of the incentives being used, following the aforementioned proposal objectives and parameters, and clearly documenting any changes or adjustments in the transparency report.\n\nMore information on the mechanics of Camelot’s nitro pools is available [here](https://docs.camelot.exchange/protocol/nitro-pools). Once the ARB tokens have been distributed to the grant multisig, Camelot will then further distribute them to internal wallets where the tokens will be used as incentives for the pools and partner integrations mentioned above under ‘Specifications’.\n\n* Camelot will receive 1,500,000 ARB tokens per month for 6 months, which it will distribute in accordance to the proposal objectives and parameters.\n* Camelot will detail how every ARB token is allocated and the progress towards the proposal objectives within the [transparency report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_os6yN7G2kdoeoXNotX0nqsYXQyJ0bakGXavmLNIXdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n* The transparency report will be shared no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are distributed.\n* Camelot will hold a bi-weekly public community call to discuss the performance and progress of the grant and the transparency report in further detail.\n\n...\n\n## Timeline\n\nCamelot will begin the grant distribution from the date this proposal is passed and the ARB is delivered until 6 months after. The 1.5M ARB will be distributed monthly to the relevant ecosystem multisig mentioned above, for a total of 6 months.\n\nOnce the grant is active, Camelot will provide the subsequent transparency reports no later than 72 hours before the next month's incentives are to be distributed. The transparency report will follow the template that is attached and will include all relevant information. Following the conclusion of the grant, Camelot will provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the grant and its impact.\n\n...\n\n## Overall cost\n\n1,500,000 ARB distributed monthly over 6 months, for a total of 9M ARB tokens.",

This will be used as a project buffer with funds either deployed in support of the program, recycled into ecosystem development or returned to Arbitrum DAO.\n\nSuccessful completion of these deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:\n\n* Number of active developers\n* Dev Github quality\n* Delegate engagement satisfaction\n* Voter participation\n* Capture-resistance\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**\n\n* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops\n* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way\n* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**\n\n* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows\n* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**\n\n* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**\n\n* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success\n* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “we can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs\n\nWithin web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.\n\n### Centralised Grants Program: Problems\n \n![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)\n    \n* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program\n* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.\n* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding\n* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to “open the door” for those who they know or have worked with before.h.\n\n### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems\n\n![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)\n    \n* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.\n* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas…\n* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.\n* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.\n* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.\n* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.\n\n### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds.\n\nAt its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\n![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)\n    \n> 💡The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n* Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n* Domain expertise and knowledge\n* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission\n* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling\n* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism\n* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n\nThis is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\n\nThis is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n![88d617338384427ed53607b929264bc8b623ef43_2_624x281.png](ipfs://bafkreiaylf4ugerhg5c755rx2ffjydpjcri6sx7mohjrafoiuylihkijfy)\n    \n### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.\n\nWeb3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n### Multisig Management\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.\n\n> 💡 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n### Team\n\nPlurality Labs Team\n\n**Disruption Joe**\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million.

Experience includes IndexCoop, US Election Assistance Commission, Johnson & Johnson, Human Performance Institute, GE, Amazon, Martha Stewart and Charles Schwab to name a few.\n\n**Shawn Grubb**\n\nAs former CIO, CEO, and non-profit chairman of the board, Shawn spent his corporate career preparing for DAO governance. Introduced to the blockchain in 2015 he went full-time degen in 2019 but moved to DAOs in 2021 when he joined Index Coop leading the governance communications and people operations. In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\n\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.\n\nIf successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1. Yes, fund Milestone 1 (3.971 million ARB)\n2. No, do not fund Milestone 1\n3. Abstain",

        "title": "Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook",
        "author": "0xb29A655f3D67B2B6724Fb22B2C2303cB660c946B",
        "body": "Author\nSaurabh, Questbook \n\nType \n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n### **Abstract**\n\n- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/) , a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/) ) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n### **Rationale** **(Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. **Aligned allocation of funds:** By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. **Increased transparency:** The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. **Increased accountability:** With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. **Lower** **Turnaround Time (TAT):** The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. **An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours.** The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. **Strong Brand Recognition** : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas. \n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n\n \n![1.1.png](ipfs://bafkreicew52tsgud3subrurhrv6jud3zyep743fpgfiv4yzw54nnty423m)\n    \n\nWe propose  [Tally’s Zodiac Governor Module](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/using-governor-with-gnosis-safe/zodiac-governor-module-for-subdaos-and-grants-programs) for security purposes. Furthermore, a Grants SAFE with 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and 4 domain allocators. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/3 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n\n![1.2.png](ipfs://bafkreifk7yaqw2lvwj35tx2rumagctyd3of6nd2bh3fawsiij74bmdlyv4)\n\n## Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program and progress each selected project such as:\n  \n \n![13a.png](ipfs://bafybeihd4opx3atmhvarhrd5t6edpmpyfi4m6ptblpl4siihpqip5qh2wu)\n    \n    \n\n2. Grants Program: \na. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\nb. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\nc. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\nd. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n3. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unallocated funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n \n![14aaa.png](ipfs://bafybeig7zsa7e7vdk7zdnmspuq4z6ciajxorckhiy3ckpro4xfcv6ycheq)\n    \nP.S\n\n1. We are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Snapshot, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted.\n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum’s community call\n7. Increased engagement in builder community’s\nDiscourse\nDiscord, Telegram\nSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)\nGitHub\n\nSubjective\n1. Improved community involvement in the grants program\n2. Strengthened builders’ sentiment towards Arbitrum\n3. Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook’s role in Arbitrum’s Grant Program\n\n- Saurabh from Questbook will be the program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community. Saurabh was previously working very closely with the Program manager of Polygon, where he facilitated the disbursement of approximately $1 million in grants. Saurabh has received a grant from IoTeX to establish their grant program, and he works closely with the Program Manager of Compound Grants Program 2.0. Saurabh has spoken to more than 100 builders and teams over the last 6-8 months and understands what it takes to make a grant program successful - from both program manager and builder perspectives.\n- Questbook Grants tool will make sure the workflows are systematic and transparent.\n\n### Product Flows\n\n1.

        "body": "Note: This proposal has been posted on behalf of the Arbitrum Incentives Working Group as a result of multiple community calls and workshops between multiple stakeholders. It does not exclude external incentive proposals from outside of the proposed structure.*\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal outlines a one-time, community-created program to distribute up to 75,000,000 ARB of DAO-funded incentives targeting active Arbitrum protocols. Aimed at fulfilling short-term community needs, the program plans to allocate DAO-owned ARB towards incentives while ensuring transparent consensus and distribution methods. It spans two voting rounds and provides incentives to eligible programs designed to fund incentives through the January 31, 2024. It asks all participating grantees to self report data, and dashboards, summarizing grant performance.\n\n**Motivation**\nThis provisional framework aims to distribute incentives fairly and effectively using transparent criteria agreed upon by the community, while a thorough system is developed (1 19, 2 7, 3 4, 4 5).\nThe goals of the program are to:\n•\tSupport Network Growth: Accelerate the distribution of incentives to Arbitrum dApps to drive network and ecosystem growth.\n•\tExperiment with Incentive Grants: Experiment with grant distribution to uncover new incentive strategies that increase user engagement and increase volume, transactions, and liquidity in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n•\tFind new models for grants and developer support that generate maximum activity on the Arbitrum network.\n•\tCreate Incentive Data: Generate data on the efficacy of distributed grants to inform future incentive programs and incentive design.\n\n**Rationale**\nBy incentivizing the use of existing Arbitrum dApps through this proposal, we anticipate increased volume, transactions, users, and liquidity, laying the groundwork for a dynamic ecosystem. While the proposal acts as an experimental program, its primary goal is to ensure basic safeguards while promoting innovative incentive strategies.\n\nGiven that this proposal aims to be a one-time, short term incentive distribution, it lacks the accountability and operational rigor that a full program may provide. As such, we encourage protocols to consider that the use of funds will be both evaluated, and monitored by the community. Any misbehavior, or failure to comply with grant requests will likely result in ineligibility, or at the very least significant discernment, in future incentive or grant programs.\n\n**Specifications**\nThe Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program will comprise up to a 75,000,000 ARB budget earmarked for incentive grants for eligible protocols. In order to expedite the distribution of this capital to the ecosystem, the DAO will adopt a bifurcated process comprising two separate processes: the Financial Proposal and Application Process.\n\n**Steps to Implement**\n \n![8b05a5d34faf8659a144f1d35081a89ae83e237e.png](ipfs://bafkreiaizvrpzwo5bn6lxl5ikdywhfakyphtdukgkywpuzpvlrokaaj2oe)\n     \nFollowing a successful Snapshot Temperature Check, the DAO will launch an expedited application and review process, allowing applicants to apply for grants concurrent with the on-chain vote to distribute DAO funds from the treasury.\n\nThe Snapshot Temperature Check will be designed to both achieve consensus and approve funding across four options, where each vote will distinguish support of up to X ARB through the end of January 31, 2024:\n•\tFor up to **25M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **50M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tFor up to **75M ARB** through January 31, 2024.\n•\tAgainst.\n\n**Financial Proposal**\nThe Financial Proposal will comprise the following:\n•\tA ratification of the Arbitrum Short-Term Incentive Program and application template 37 as articulated in this document.\n•\tApproval of the eligibility criteria, grant budget parameters, distribution strategy, and evaluation requirements.\n•\tA 25,000,000, 50,000,000 or 75,000,000 ARB distribution to the program Multisig.\n•\tA 32,000 ARB operational budget for community/project facilitation.\no\t20,000 ARB to @tnorm as retroactive payment for conducting community moderation:\n\tDraft and review of multiple iterations of incentive proposals.\n\tModeration of community calls and working group telegram.\n\tCoordination individually across dozens of stakeholders and community members over the past three weeks.\no\t12,000 ARB Multisig Signers (A new version of the PL-ARB Grants Safety Multisig 17 - 2K per signer).\n\n**Multisig Setup**\nA new multisig will be created with the signers from the original pl-ARB multisig, under the name of the Arbitrum DAO. The new multisig will include two features to ensure accountability of signers and grantees:\n\n1.\tClawback capability so the DAO can retrieve funds if the multisig violates the agreement.\n2.\tStreaming of funds to grantees every second week for the grants duration using Hedgey. This allows for the halting of funds if misuse is discovered with the goal to stop bad actors, not punish bad designs.\n\n**What are the Eligibility Requirements?**\n\nGrant Requirements:\n•\tGrantees are required to keep distributions in ARB without converting to other assets.\n•\tGrantees must not farm their own incentive programs.\n•\tGrantees must outline a spending plan, provide a pro forma, and state the grant’s objective.\n•\tGrantees must commit to providing data on distributions, all ARB spending transactions, and key metrics like daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period, and be presented preferably in a Dune Spell/dashboard or alternatively in a report.\n•\tGrantees must agree to share all contract addresses being used to distribute incentive rewards.\n•\tGrantees must disclose the contracts being incentivized and denote any external contracts being incentivized as part of the program.\n•\tGrantees can only incentive contracts on the Arbitrum Network.\n•\tGrants are not to be used in DAO governance.\n•\tGrantees are expected to not encourage or partake in sybil attacks against the forum to sway community opinion.\n•\tGrantees must agree to KYC with the Arbitrum Foundation in order to receive funds.\n•\tGrantees must apply using the approved program application template 15.\n\nBy streaming grant payments, the multisig will be empowered to hold grantees accountable to their proposals by halting fund streaming for any of the following reasons:\n\n•\tAny use of funds not explicitly described in the grantees application.\n•\tFailure to comply with data reporting standards.\no\tGrantee recipients will be required to provide Dune dashboards uploaded and posted to the forum by eligible teams by December 15, 2023.\n•\t•\tDashboard requirements are: Daily TVL, transactions, volumes, unique addresses, and transaction fees for incentivized protocols. This data should cover 30 days before, during, and after the Incentivization period. If a metric does not apply, or this is not achievable, it should be noted in the application.\n•\t•\tMore granular dashboards (including pool-level and user analysis) will be noted by the community for future programs.\no\tIf dashboards are not posted by this date, the multisig will be empowered to halt incentive funding streams for protocols at their discretion.\nIn that this proposal aims to be experimental, the multisig is not intended to provide quality control on the design of incentive programs. Rather, they are empowered to halt streaming in the event of negligence or misuse of funds.\n\n**Eligibility and Evaluation Guidelines**\nGrants span two award cycles, but projects can only be awarded once. Projects rejected in the first cycle are invited to address delegate/community feedback and reapply for the second cycle.\nProtocols can submit grant applications for amounts they feel appropriate. While there’s no ARB limit, delegates and voters will assess each grant individually.\nAs such, the Arbitrum Working Group has included four grant categories, as well as some recommended metrics by which the community might consider evaluating the grants:\n\n•\t**Beacon Grants (<= 200K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 2 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $1.5M TVL.\n\t.>$2M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Siren Grants (Up to 750K ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 4 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $4M TVL.\n\t.>$40M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Lighthouse Grants* (Up to 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 6 months.\n\tMeets one of the following criteria:\n\t.> $15M Arbitrum Network TVL.\n\t.> $100M 30D cumulative Volume.\n\n•\t**Pinnacle Grants* (> 2M ARB)**\no\tRecommendations:\n\tLive on Arbitrum for at least 12 months\n\tMeets one of the following criteria\n\t.> $30M Arbitrum Network TVL\n\t.> $200M 30D cumulative volume\n\n*Grants greater than $1M ARB will be asked to include milestone-based funding tranches in their application.\n\nOne could reasonably use the date of publication for this proposal to inform these metrics.\n\n**Steps to Implement (How does the DAO Approve Grants)?**\nGrants will be approved via a three week process across two cycles.\n\nCycle 1\n1.\tApplication Period (1 Week):\nDuring the Application Stage of the program, eligible protocols will be invited to post proposals in the “Incentive Grant Applications” Category of the Arbitrum Forum using the official Application Template 20.\nOnce posted, the community may provide feedback on the proposal through the end of the Review Period.\n\n2.\tReview Period (1 Week):\nDelegates and network stakeholders will be asked to provide feedback on grant applications upon each specific forum post. Delegates should engage with the goal of ensuring the responsible use of funds. This means an application should represent a comprehensive strategy for incentive distribution, align with the program goals and requirements, and present their plan to adhere to the aforementioned data standards.\nApplicants are expected to adjust, amend, and update their proposals in line with community feedback over this time period. Due to the accelerated timeline of the program, feedback and communication between delegates and applicants will be critical.\n\n3.\tVoting Period (1 Week):\nA delegate will sponsor the proposal throughout the governance process for each grant application. ARB holders and ARB delegates will be invited to vote on each submitted proposal via Snapshot Poll.\nTo succeed, eligible applications must receive a greater than 50% majority in favor of the proposal, and receive greater than 71.51 million ARB in favor of the application. If successful, applicants will coordinate with the Arbitrum Foundation and the PL-ARB multisig to secure the completion of KYC, and receive funding to the address included in their application.\n\nCycle 2\nRepeat the process outlined in Cycle 1, with the exception that the review period for the second round will comprise a 2 week review period.\n\n**Timeline**\n[See image above]\nSep. 01, 2023 - Forum Post\nSep. 09, 2023 - Snapshot Vote Begins\n\nCycle 1\nSep. 16, 2023 - On-Chain Vote and Application Period\nSep. 23, 2023 - Review Period Begins\nSep. 30, 2023 - Voting Round Begins\nOct. 07, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\nCycle 2\nOct 07, 2023 - Application Period 2 Begins\nOct 14, 2023 - Review Period 2 Begins\nOct 28, 2023 - Voting Round 2 Begins\nNov. 04, 2023 - Funds Distributed\n\n**Overall Cost**\nUp to 75,032,000 ARB.\n\n**Outstanding Questions and Concerns**\n\nWhat happens if the budget is exceeded?\nWe do not expect applications to exceed the funding budget of 75M ARB. However, if requested grants do exceed the allocated budget, funding will be allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis dependent upon the time the proposal was submitted to the Arbitrum Forum. In the event that the budget is exceeded, the DAO may choose to unlock further funds for a third round, or backfund successful incentive proposals.\n\nWhat will happen to excess funds?\nFollowing Cycle 2, excess funds remaining in the multisig will be returned to the Arbitrum Treasury address by the multisig.\n\nWhat is the plan after the Short Term Incentive Program?\nThe Short Term Incentive Program is designed specifically as a one-time program, with the intention of allowing incentives while the DAO designs a more robust, sustainable program in the months throughout the end of the year.\nAt the end of the year, if there is no program in place, protocols can put forth direct votes to on-chain governance to extend their programs. This program offers an opportunity for participating protocols to demonstrate mission-aligned conduct as justification for future funding.\n\nWhat are the specific KPIs for this program - what determines its success?\n•\tCommunity Support: The primary KPI for this proposal is aligning with both delegates and protocols to agree on the distribution of funds through the end of 2023, with an agreement to work towards a more efficient, comprehensive, and effective program in 2024.\n•\tNetwork Activity: An increase in network metrics such as TVL, Volume, Users and Transactions on the incentivized protocols in addition to an increase in general network activity.\n•\tCommunity Awareness: Raised awareness, collaboration, and understanding of incentive distribution strategies and tactics.\n•\tIncentives Data: Increased data on incentives, grants, and protocol behavior to inform future Arbitrum incentive programs and iterations.\n\n**Forum Link **\n\nThis snapshot is replication of the forum post.

        "body": "**Changes Based on Feedback Since the Temperature Check Version (posted 20th Oct)**\n\n- For simplicity and security reasons, decided to forego the token mint aspect of the proposal entirely and fund staking with a treasury request instead. Using the mint to fund staking was deemed too circular and not a necessary step based on feedback.\n- Added the idea of the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ as a potential key partner to gather data and monitor the impacts of this staking mechanism over the next 12 months with the end goal of using these insights to refine the ARB staking mechanism further. This collaboration is reliant on the Arbitrum Coalition’s conditional funding.\n- Added an additional 1.25% voting option\n- Clarified that voting will be ranked choice voting with five different options\n\n**Changes Based on Feedback Since the RFC Version**\n\n- Added several options for voting - 1.75%, 1.5%, and 1%. Examples of APRs at different ARB staking percentages can be found later in the proposal.\n- The maximum lock penalty % has been changed from 80% to 60%.\n- Suggested that the implementation details (selecting a vendor and auditor) will be decided in a further proposal\n\n# Abstract\nThe Arbitrum DAO treasury is growing rapidly, yet that growth is not currently being shared with token holders. The Arbitrum DAO treasury address holds 3,54B ARB tokens, and an unexpected $69,4M of unclaimed individual ARB airdrops were recently returned to the DAO treasury. The treasury is exceptionally well funded, and it’s important to note that the DAO fully controls the usage of the Arbitrum DAO treasury and that all surplus revenues belong to the DAO. This includes sequencer revenues.\n\nWe believe that the Arbitrum token needs a staking mechanism. We propose creating a mechanism that distributes ARB to token lockers. A locking mechanism would incentivize long-term token holders and become a fundamental building block for future token utility proposals (e.g., distributing sequencer revenues).\n\nAlong with creating a locking mechanism, we propose requesting 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total ARB token supply from the Arbitrum DAO treasury and distributing this over 12 months through the proposed locking mechanism. The final amount would be decided with a Snapshot and that decision cemented on-chain with a Tally vote. We suggest that the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ gathers data and monitors the impacts of this staking mechanism over the 12-month period and potentially audits the contracts if funded in time. Of course, this relationship is reliant on both proposals passing and the DAO and Coalition Advocate supporting the scope of work for the coalition. The goal is to use these insights to give the DAO the data and tools to refine the ARB staking mechanism further.\n\nIt is important to note that this proposal is entirely separate from the ongoing liquidity incentives framework and grant discussion. Both can and should co-exist - Arbitrum should have a functional grants framework and a staking mechanism. The Arbitrum DAO STIP program has recently concluded, and 50M ARB tokens will enter the market over the coming months. As proposed here, a supply sink through staking would benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIn the discussions over the previous months, we’ve seen the legal aspect be a deterrent to sharing value with ARB token holders in the form of revenue. The way we are proposing the staking mechanism through using existing treasury funds to reward lockers in ARB is the most palatable option from a legal perspective, as it does not involve sharing revenues. It also does not rule out the possibility of later moving on to a model that allows for other value accrual methods to the token. Should our proposal pass, when additional value accrual methods are proposed and the legal landscape is more mature and better understood, the process will likely be much quicker since a staking mechanism is already in use with audited contracts in place.\n\nWe thank the following delegates and others for their valuable feedback while drafting this proposal.\n\nWestie from Blockworks Research\nCoinflipcanada\nAnd several others\n\n# Motivation\nThe Arbitrum ecosystem would benefit in multiple ways from a staking mechanism that is constructed to heavily align incentives with those most aligned with the ecosystem long-term. While staking mechanisms are familiar and a mainstay across DeFi, sustainable models and their impact on the token in question have been scarcely studied. These staking mechanisms are often poorly designed and have rampant inflation that negatively affects the token.\n\nRegarding staking mechanisms, there are few examples to model after in the Layer 2 token space. We propose that the Arbitrum ecosystem takes the first step in this endeavor and leads the way - as it already does in many other verticals. We believe that to construct a long-term staking mechanism that is sustainable, there is first a need to gather actual data that is strictly specific to the Arbitrum ecosystem and the ARB token.\n\nBecause of this, we propose that the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ monitors the effects of this 12-month staking experiment and provides quarterly updates on the impacts of the mechanism through dashboards and qualitative reporting. After the 12-month staking experiment is over, we suggest that the DAO funds the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ to produce a comprehensive report with results and recommendations on what they believe is the most sustainable way forward in building a staking mechanism and incentive model that is sustainable yet attractive for the ARB token. The expertise of the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ is perfectly suited for analyzing the results of this experiment, given that Gauntlet is an industry-leading authority in tokenomics design, Blockworks spearheads the industry’s research efforts and Trail of Bits is a top-tier security organization. To read more about the Arbitrum Coalition, please visit their proposal here.\n\n# Broader Implications for Arbitrum\nThis proposal passing would have extremely positive implications for the entire Arbitrum ecosystem. Having a native staking model that the DAO officially approves would be likely to have the following consequences:\n\n- Significantly increase interest in Arbitrum and the ARB token\n- Allow for composability around an ARB token that can earn yield\n- Reward long-term aligned stakers with yield while penalizing mercenary capital and short-term actors\n- Positively differentiate ARB from any other L2 tokens and bring the spotlight back to Arbitrum\n- Offer a first step and infrastructure towards introducing different forms of revenue sharing in the future\n\nThese are some of the benefits that will likely result from having a staking mechanism; however, verifying these predictions’ accuracy by an independent third party such as the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ is important. These hypotheses cannot be truly verified without actual data, highlighting the importance of a 12-month trial period for staking.\n\n# Benefits for Users\nBy introducing a staking contract that responsibly distributes the allotted amount of tokens to users who are willing to lock their ARB, the incentives are aligned in a way that rewards those parties most loyal to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This includes long-term holders of ARB and DAOs that have received an airdrop and are willing to lock their tokens.\n\nThe figures below detail possible APRs for stakers at different staked percentages if 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25% or 1% of the total supply was distributed annually. The current circulating supply of ARB is approximately 1.275B.\n\n![87f8dc9e506d60ebd15f3098d0ff626ee8453c71.png](ipfs://bafkreifv3akc3qub3mmknewbcjwchy2vc7astm2wp33occluoj4r576lu4)\n\n# Specification\n- The ARB staking contract will allow users to lock their ARB for up to 365 calendar days. A user’s weight is proportional to their lock time.\n- Users may increase their lock times.\n- Users may pause their lock times (meaning the time to unlock does not increase this saves having to relock continuously)\n- Users may have many independent locks.\n- Users will receive and may claim ARB emissions according to their weight.\n- Users may exit their lock for a penalty between 0-60% of their lock amount, linear vs. lock time remaining (365 days remaining would mean a 60% penalty, and 0 days would be a 0% penalty). This penalty is shared between remaining users according to weight.\n\nExample usage: ARB locker\n\n- The user locks 100 ARB for 365 days.\n   - The lock weight formula is (ARB amount locked * lock time / 365)\n   - Their ARB lock ‘weight’ is currently 100 (100 ARB * 365/365).\n   - All rewards are distributed based on a user’s weight / the total sum of all the users’ weights.\n- After 182.5 days, the user will have a lock ‘weight’ of 50 (100 ARB * 182.5/365).\n   - At this point, they may increase their lock time, do nothing, or withdraw.\n   - The early exit penalty is (0.6 * lock time / 365)%.\n   - For a lock time of 182.5 days, the penalty is, therefore, 30% of the locked amount - if the user were to withdraw now, they would receive back 70 ARB.\n- ARB staked in this contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n1. Why a locking mechanism?\n\nA locking mechanism allows users who are long-term believers in Arbitrum to signal this belief through their actions and get rewarded for it accordingly. Locking for longer is always optional - users may lock for any time period. One year is a reasonable lock time compared to the previously popular 4-year locking model. A one-year lock is not too long to the point of disincentiving locking, as users can choose the lock duration. Not only does this give individuals optionality and a mechanism to earn a native yield on their ARB tokens, but it also gives protocols that were a part of the DAO airdrop or have otherwise accumulated ARB a mechanism to earn on their treasury.\n\n2. What are the consequences of this proposal?\n\nUltimately, this proposal introduces utility to ARB and gives users more incentive to hold. In addition, long-term believers will be net increasing their network share, which sets up a base from which we can build further proposals for ARB value accrual without worrying about the distribution mechanism.\n\n3. What would this staking mechanism mean for delegation?\n\nFrom a user standpoint, it’s important to note that the ARB staked in the proposed contract will still have voting rights and can be delegated - voting power will not be diminished by a shorter lock length. The staking contract will be upgradeable and controlled by the DAO - this ensures that the DAO can pause this distribution at any time.\n\n# Summary\nAs it stands today, ARB has no native utility or yield. We propose approving the creation of the staking contract detailed above and distributing an equivalent of 1.75%, 1.5%, 1.25%, or 1% of the total ARB supply from the DAO treasury to the staking contract. These tokens would be distributed over a 12-month period, during which the ‘Arbitrum Coalition’ could - pending their proposal passing - monitor the impacts of the proposed staking mechanism and draft a report and recommendations by the end of the period. Note that the Arbitrum Coalition proposal is entirely separate yet synergistic to this proposal. The passing of either proposal is not conditional on the other proposal’s performance.\n\nIt’s important to highlight that to move toward a final and refined version of value accrual to the ARB token, trial and experimentation is required. We believe there is a strong need for actual data from a live staking mechanism, such as the one suggested in this proposal, from the unique context of Arbitrum’s growing ecosystem to make more informed decisions on what the ultimate mechanism for ARB staking and value accrual might look like.\n\nInnovation has always been Arbitrum’s forte in both technical advancements and building a vibrant community - we believe that the approach to building a cutting-edge staking model for ARB through trial and experimentation is a logical way forward.\n\n# Timeline\nThis proposal will follow the official lifecycle of an AIP detailed here. Please note that this proposal is a non-constitutional proposal.\n\nThe suggested timeline can be found below.\n\nWeek 36-37 - Forum post, request for comments and feedback (Complete)\nWeek 43-44 - Temperature check forum post & Snapshot poll (1 week)\nWeek 45 - Formal AIP and call-for-voting (3 days)\nWeek 45-46 - On-chain DAO vote on Tally (14 days)\nWeek 47 onwards - Implementation phase\n\nIf the proposal passes, a draft of the implementation phase is detailed below in “Suggested Steps to Implement.” The final implementation schedule depends on the result of the vendor decision proposal, community review, audit schedules, and subsequent findings. A concrete schedule for the implementation stage will thus be locked in at a later stage.\n\n# Voting Options on Snapshot\nWhen this proposal moves to Snapshot, there will be five voting options. The voting method will be ranked choice voting. To read more about ranked choice voting, please visit this article from Snapshot.\n\n1. Fund staking with 1.75% of the total ARB supply (175M ARB tokens)\n2. Fund staking with 1.5% of the total ARB supply (150M ARB tokens)\n3. Fund staking with 1.25% of the total ARB supply (125M ARB tokens)\n4. Fund staking with 1% of the total ARB supply (100M ARB tokens)\n5. Do not fund staking\n\n# Suggested Steps to Implement\n1. The Arbitrum DAO will receive another proposal concerning implementation, which will aim to decide the vendor of the implementation and associated contracts and an auditor.\n2. After the contracts and audits are finished, they will be provided to the community for review for two weeks.\n3. After the community review period, the contracts will be deployed to Arbitrum, and the ownership will be transferred to the DAO.\n4. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n# Costs\nThe costs of this proposal are mainly related to the implementation process, during which a vendor and auditor will be decided. The true extent of these costs can only be estimated after these decisions are made.",
