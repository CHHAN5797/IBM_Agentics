By introducing this gauge, we aim to incentivize liquidity provision and enhance trading activity for the MORE stablecoin on Arbitrum. This pool will serve as the primary liquidity source for MORE on Arbitrum and will utilize Gyroscope's innovative E-CLP technology.\n\n* Pool:https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x4284c68f567903537e2d9ff726fdf8591e431ddc0002000000000000000005b5\n* Child gauge on Arbitrum: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3b9c6c47bd3ac2e5e284265757ea2f6a4aed5fcc\n* Arbitrum root gauge on Ethereum: https://etherscan.io/address/0x2400b9BAfb56Ec6D9eCeE50aF463A155Cf46db98#readContract\n\n## References / Useful Links\n\n* [Website / App](https://www.stackmore.xyz/)\n* [Docs](https://docs.stackmore.xyz/)\n* [X](https://x.com/stackmorexyz)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/M5jG6t8JQE)\n\n## Protocol Description\n\n* MORE is a collateral-backed stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, issued by Stack Finance.\n* GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by [Gyroscope] https://gyro.finance/\n\nStack Finance is a Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) protocol on the re.al L2 network, specializing in leveraging crypto-native and real-world asset (RWA) tokens. Users can deposit a variety of assets as collateral to borrow the stablecoin MORE. Advanced leverage features allow users to loop borrowed MORE to acquire additional collateral, making it highly effective when using yield-bearing tokens. Stack Finance is uniquely positioned to cater specifically to tokenized RWAs as the re.al blockchain is meant to be a liquidity hub for RWA DeFi.\n\nMORE is designed to maintain a $1 peg through collateral backing that exceeds $1 for every $1 of MORE issued. While Stack Finance considers MORE to be worth $1, the price may occasionally deviate. To stabilize the peg, the protocol employs mechanisms like interest rate adjustments and arbitrage opportunities, encouraging users to act in ways that restore the peg.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEnabling a gauge for the MORE/USDC E-CLP pool on Arbitrum aligns with Stack Finance's strategy to expand MORE's liquidity across multiple chain ecosystems. This initiative aims to boost liquidity by attracting more liquidity providers, enhance the trading experience through improved price stability and reduced slippage, which will help Stack Finance to strengthen its DeFi integrations.\n\n## Specifications\n\n* Governance: Stack Finance's governance is currently managed through a team-controlled multi-signature wallet. The protocol plans to transition to a decentralized governance model in the future, once the system achieves greater stability and market resilience.\n* Oracles: There are currently no oracles for MORE on Arbitrum. The protocol does not rely on external oracles for its core functionalities on this network.\n* Audits: Prior to deployment, Stack Finance underwent two comprehensive audit rounds to ensure the security and reliability of the protocol. The first was a private audit conducted by Omniscia, and the second audit was a public one performed by WatchPug. The detailed report from WatchPug's audit can be viewed[ here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlnOyweoD9Jy_0vNvDozPS5RVEOw_qwT/view).\n* Centralization Vectors: Currently, Stack Finance has centralization vectors primarily associated with upgradeability and governance control. The protocol's smart contracts are upgradeable via a multi-signature wallet controlled by the team. Additionally, until the protocol transitions to a decentralized governance model, the team retains control over protocol parameters and decision-making processes.\n* Market History: Since its launch in June 2024 on the re.al L2, Stack Finance has accumulated over $2M in TVL. The MORE stablecoin has consistently maintained its $1 peg, experiencing a maximum deviation of 2%, which was swiftly corrected as per protocol designed mechanisms. Stack Finance has deployed MORE liquidity pools across multiple ecosystems, including a MORE/USDT pool on ThenaFi on the BNB Chain, a MORE/USDC pool on Tokan on Scroll, and a MORE/USTB pool on PearlFi on re.al.\n* Value: The MORE/GYD E-CLP pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for MORE on Arbitrum. Enabling the gauge will incentivize liquidity providers by offering veBAL rewards and additional bribes from Stack Finance, thereby attracting more participants and increasing the pool's depth. This will generate consistent fees through heightened trading activity, benefiting the Balancer ecosystem as a consequence.\n\n#### Specification\n\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>\n>\n> gauge(address): `0x2400b9BAfb56Ec6D9eCeE50aF463A155Cf46db98`\n> gaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a). Both pools are in the top 6 on Balancer on Ethereum by TVL.\n\nRenzo strives to be the most secure and efficient liquid restaking token across DeFi and on Ethereum L2s. Renzo is currently focused on diversification efforts to increase the number of node operators on EigenLayer, increasing decentralization and improving security for Actively Validated Services (AVS). Renzo is also working on supporting various LSTs deposits through the platform and building partnerships/integrations across aggregators, DEXs, bridges, Oracle providers, L2s, and other DeFi projects.\n\nValue: The ezETH/wstETH pool on Balancer is intended to serve as a primary liquidity source for the token on Arbitrum.\n\nezETH on Arbitrum: [0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5)\n\nezETH/wstETH Arbitrum pool on Balancer: https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x7a66b9ef65a88e9abc94a08c9b043e73685d850b000000000000000000000517\n\nChild chain gauge: [0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7C4A6B0c16cA99e65822Cc531403cE2f8A20A912#code) Mainnet root gauge: [0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1#code)\n\n### Specification\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xCD41Bc6DC6e9821C4C36848Ff3397493e458A5d1`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/918\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Optimism, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Optimism: 0x2218a117083f5B482B0bB821d27056Ba9c04b1D3\n\nsDAI/aUSDC Optimism pool on Gyro: [Gyroscope Protocol](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/optimism/e-clp/0x876e0a21626c33bdab879330505eccc6091aa607/)\n\nChild chain gauge: [[Vyper_contract | Address 0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340 | OP Mainnet Etherscan ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xC9B49E2Ae035De1CFA69B4d524A8B5cfedc1a340)]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x9dE7f79Ef7f28447E90051b60aBC5c2b1AdFE1cf\n\ngaugeType(string): Optimism",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/788\n\nProposal Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to enable an svETH/wstETH gauge on Balancer at:\n\nhttps://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xdedb11a6a23263469567c2881a9b9f8629ee0041000000000000000000000669\n\nGauge address:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xD98ed0426D18B115d6388923803e33ad8aaF11F8\n\nIncentivization Strategy\n\nWe will adopt a two-pronged incentivization strategy.\n\nWe will directly stream rewards to Aura, so that Balancer LPs can maximize yields. We will also bribe Hidden Hand for additional votes to reward our pools.\n\nThe bribes will be paid in wETH.\n\nRewards streamed to Aura will be paid in the form of either our reserve-based utility token, VEC, or in the form of psVEC. psVEC is the yield-boosted version of staked VEC (sVEC) that has been wrapped into a Pod on Peapods Finance to deliver increased rewards.\n\nYou can read more about VEC in our Protocol Description below.\n\nKey Links\n\nWebsite: https://www.vectorreserve.com/\n\nDocs: https://vector-reserve.gitbook.io/\n\ndApp: https://www.vectorreserve.com/dapp\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vectorreserve\n\nGithub: https://github.com/vectorreserve\n\nProtocol Description\n\nvETH is DeFi’s first Liquidity Position Derivative (LPD), introduced by Vector Reserve.\n\nsvETH is the staked version of vETH, which users receive when they stake their tokens to earn additional rewards.\n\nLPDs, or Liquidity Position Derivatives, are a never-before-seen asset class, capturing the yield from various LSTs and LRTs in a diversified fashion - while maximizing the ways to earn yield from each of them.\n\nvETH can be minted using any approved asset on our dApp, and staked to earn yield from the following sources:\n\n1. Staking and Restaking gains from holding LSTs and LRTs\n\n2. LP fees from pairing these assets on various DEXs\n\n3. Upcoming Superfluid Staking: The process of restaking liquidity positions on EigenLayer to earn additional yield. When this feature of EigenLayer goes live, we aim to be the market leader with a large treasury of LST/LRT-based LP positions backing vETH.\n\nThis approach allows us to generate best-in-market yield, giving vETH holders an advantage over holding standard LSTs or LRTs.\n\nHolders can then stake the vETH on the Vector Reserve dApp to receive svETH and earn additional rewards.\n\nOur reserve-based utility token, VEC, has a symbiotic relationship with the vETH token. While vETH generates value for the Vector Reserve, being a great source of treasury revenue, VEC is emitted to generate liquidity for vETH pairs across multiple DEXs - ensuring the product remains competitive in all areas. Every VEC token is backed by assets within the Vector Reserve, which grow from a share of yield generated by vETH as well as LP positions acquired through bonding.\n\nWith over $30m TVL accumulated across vETH and sVEC since launch, Vector Reserve is pioneering the next stage of the liquid restaking revolution.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Balancer vETH/wstETH gauge will play an important early role in incentivising liquidity providers to help with the process of bootstrapping initial liquidity. It will then serve as an important source of liquidity for svETH on an ongoing basis, supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.\n\nSpecifications\n\nGovernance: Here is a link to the multisig wallet for the owner safe:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xe0EB63B4E18FF1e646ab7E37510E6EaF287AdE3D\n\nOracles: No external oracles.\n\nRate Provider Contract: The rate provider contract for svETH(https://etherscan.io/address/0xad4bFaFAe75ECd3fED5cFad4E4E9847Cd47A1879#readContract) can be seen here. It is currently under review(https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/11) by the Balancer integrations team prior to snapshot voting.\n\nAudits: First audit can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/JacoboLansac/audits/blob/main/solo/vector-reserve.md\n\nSecond audit can be viewed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/GeorgeHNTR/portfolio/blob/main/reports/solo/Vector-Reserve-Security-Review.pdf\n\nCentralization Vectors: We have a small engineering team, with one lead engineer, but plans and funds are in place to scale as needed. The treasury is currently controlled by the multisig wallet.\n\nMarket History: Vector Reserve and vETH minting launched along with svETH staking on Thursday 25th January 2024. Since then Vector TVL has rapidly accumulated over $40m in TVL. There have been no major volatility events attached to svETH since launch.\n\nValue: We believe in migrating the majority yield pool to wherever the majority of user provided LP is. Therefore, if the Balancer pool proves very popular for our community, it is very likely that we will support it to become the primary source of liquidity.\n\nTechnical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xD98ed0426D18B115d6388923803e33ad8aaF11F8`\n\ngaugeType(string):` Ethereum`",

        "title": "[BIP-604] Enable Gauge for sDAI / aUSDC pools on Base",
        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/949\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal seeks a Balancer Gauge for an sDAI/aUSDC pool on Base, with uncapped emissions. The pool is yield bearing and will be considered a core pool.\n\nThe underlying pools are Rehype Pools, an extension of Gyroscope’s E-CLPs. Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n\n## References/Useful links:\n\nWebsite: https://spark.fi/\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.spark.fi/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sparkdotfi\n\n## Protocol Description:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is a tokenized representation of Dai deposited in the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) offered by MakerDAO. The sDAI token enables users to receive returns on their DSR deposits while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and use it in any way they want.\n\nsDAI increases in value according to the DSR, as its Dai denominated value gradually increases over time. sDAI is an accumulating token, not a rebasing token. Each sDAI is fungible and always instantly redeemable for DAI.\n\nTo acquire sDAI you can deposit Dai and other stablecoins using the [Spark App](https://docs.spark.fi/spark-app/spark-app-user-guide/earning-dai-savings-rate).\n\n## Motivation:\n\nSpark is seeking to establish Balancer and Gyroscope as its primary liquidity sources for sDAI on the Superchain - Optimism and Base. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the sDAI community.\n\n## Specifications:\n\nSavings Dai (sDAI) is an ERC-4626 representation/wrapper of DAI in the Dai Savings Rate module (DSR). sDAI allows users to deposit DAI to receive the yield generated by the Maker protocol while still being able to transfer, stake, lend and any other use cases. “Swapping” between DAI and sDAI does not need to be done via a DEX but can be achieved by depositing and withdrawing from the DSR module.\n\n**Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module).\n\n**Oracles:** This pool relies on the SavingsDAIRateProvider 1 to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/50/commits/4f06d0e855478a67e8f936498dc38c46d7d28751).\n\n**Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen[ here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen here.\n\n**Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n**Market History**: sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai).\n\n**Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and aUSDC.\n\n### Specifications\n\nsDAI on Base: 0x99aC4484e8a1dbd6A185380B3A811913Ac884D87\n\nsDAI / aUSDC Base pool on Gyro: https://app.gyro.finance/pools/base/e-clp/0x821afe819450a359e29a5209c48f2fa3321c8ad2/\n\nChild chain gauge: [https://basescan.org/address/0x6A3F93bB18fbdDea76169D3D94d03371E9e0DdC4#code]\n\nMainnet root: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1]\n\n## Technical Specification:\n\nTransaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860 will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at 0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): 0x39a6D33557d31151F88D0b12Ab2D2Fb659c238A1\n\ngaugeType(string): Base",
