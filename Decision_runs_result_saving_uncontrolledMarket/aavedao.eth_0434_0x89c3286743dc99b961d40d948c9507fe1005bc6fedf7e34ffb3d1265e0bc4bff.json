The goal is to enhance the sustainability and independence of the program, ensuring continued support for active delegates in the Aave community.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nThe pilot phase of Orbit, funded by ACI, has been a success in its first quarter. Recognizing its positive impact, there's a need to expand and generalize the program, ensuring its longevity and alignment with the broader Aave community goals.\n\n## Specification:\n\nThe proposed funding for the Orbit initiative remains at $5,000 per month, with payments to be made in GHO stablecoin. Orbit operates on a quarterly basis, with eligibility criteria defined for each quarter.\n\nFor the upcoming quarter, the eligibility criteria will mirror that of the [[ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-quarterly-gas-rebate-distribution-august-2023/14680). In subsequent quarters, a threshold of voting power and diversity of delegation will be introduced to ensure the program's integrity and to prevent potential abuse. To fund the Orbit initiative, stablecoins from the Aave DAO treasury will be used to purchase GHO on secondary markets, which is expected to have a minor positive effect on the GHO peg.\n\n### Eligible Delegates:\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Participation Rate |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 100.0% |\n| ACI | 0x329c54289ff5d6b7b7dae13592c6b1eda1543ed4 | 94.67% |\n| Wintermute | 0xb933aee47c438f22de0747d57fc239fe37878dd1 | 93.33% |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 93.33% |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 86.67% |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 78.67% |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 73.33% |\n| NewTokenLogic | 0x2cc1ade245020fc5aae66ad443e1f66e01c54df1 | 32.0%* |\n\n*Note: Tokenlogic transitioned from an old to a new delegate address during last quarter, their cumulative score considering both addresses is matching other delegates scores*\n\n### Recipient Delegates\n\nhere's the list of delegates accepting participation in Orbit. for the next quarter\n\n| Delegate Name | Address | Budget |\n|---------------|---------|-------------------|\n| StableLab | 0xea172676e4105e92cc52dbf45fd93b274ec96676 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Keyrock | 0x1855f41b8a86e701e33199de7c25d3e3830698ba | 15.000 GHO |\n| LBS Blockchain | 0xb83b3e9c8e3393889afb272d354a7a3bd1fbcf5c | 15.000 GHO |\n| HKUST | 0xe4594a66d9507ffc0d4335cc240bd61c1173e666 | 15.000 GHO |\n| Michigan | 0x13bdae8c5f0fc40231f0e6a4ad70196f59138548 | 15.000 GHO |\n|**Total Budget** | **75.000 GHO**|\n\n### Implementation:\n\nIf this ARFC gets governance support, the implementation will consolidate some Aave DAO treasury stablecoin holdings to acquire GHO on secondary markets. Subsequently, a new set of streams of 15,000 GHO will be created to the eligible delegates' addresses for a period of 90 days.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps:\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The following address will be the recipient of the stream:\n\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nThis will allow the TokenLogic to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment for the creation of this proposal.

The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.\n\nThis integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.\n\nAlongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.\n\nIt's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.\n\nwGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:\n\n- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.\n- wGHO parameters:\n\n| LTV | 77% |\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 80%  |\n| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |\n| Supply Cap | 1M |\n| Borrow Cap | 0 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |\n\n### Note:\n\nwGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.\n\nOnboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback and consensus on this ARFC.\n2. Escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot Stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "Title: [ARFC] ACI Service Provider 6-month Proposal\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\nDate: 2023-03-29\n\n## Summary:\nThis ARFC introduces the Aave Chan Initiative Service Provider 6-Month Budget Proposal, following [the successful TEMP CHECK](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344) via [snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x22eb6c5cdaf3731d4d6e0f4bb179e4cf6fa87470e87323f373f0bb01baceb9af). The proposal aims to allocate funds to the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) treasury for the next six months, enabling us to actively engage in the Aave ecosystem and contribute to its growth and improvement.\n\n## Abstract:\nif this proposal were to be approved by governance, a stream of the allocated budget would be started to the ACI treasury wallet. It will be used to cover various aspects of the ACI's involvement in the Aave community, including team compensation, community engagement, research and development, infrastructure costs & tooling subscriptions, marketing, and communications.\n\n## Motivation:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative has been a dedicated contributor to the Aave ecosystem. The 6-Month Budget Proposal aims to secure the necessary resources to continue the ACI's work, ensuring that we can maintain our level of commitment and contribution to the Aave ecosystem. For more details about the ACI proposal, please refers to the [TEMP CHECK version of the current proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-chan-initiative-6-month-budget-proposal/12344)\n\n## Specification:\nIf this proposal is approved, a stream of the allocated budget will be activated, with `treasury.aavechan.eth` (0x57ab7ee15cE5ECacB1aB84EE42D5A9d0d8112922) as the recipient. This will allow the ACI to periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\nIn terms of technical implementation, the AIP will call the `createStream()` method of the `IAaveEcosystemReserveController` interface to create a 180-day stream of 250,000 aUSDT.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is an independent organization focused on contributing to the Aave ecosystem. This proposal was not commissioned or paid for by any third party.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "title": "[ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023",
        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "Title: [ARFC] Quarterly Gas Rebate Distribution - August 2023\nAuthor: Marc Zeller (@marczeller) - Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\nDate: 2023-09-04\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\nThis ARFC proposes the quarterly gas rebate distribution for recognized delegates. The distribution aims to reimburse the gas costs incurred by delegates during their participation in Aave governance.\n\n## Motivation:\nRecognized delegates play a crucial role in Aave governance by actively participating in proposal discussions, voting, and other governance activities. These activities often involve gas costs, especially when interacting with the Ethereum network. The Aave community established a quarterly gas rebate distribution to incentivize and support their continued participation.\n\n## Specification:\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the total gas used by each recognized delegate and the corresponding ETH amount to be distributed:\n\n| Name             | Total Gas Spent          |\n|------------------|--------------------------|\n| ACI              | 1.35      |\n| HKTrust          | 0.07     |\n| TokenLogic       | 0.50     |\n| michigan         | 0.11     |\n| LBS Blockchain   | 0.18     |\n| Wintermute       | 0.15     |\n| keyrock          | 0.14     |\n| Stablelab        | 0.20     |\n| **Total ETH** | **2.7 ETH** | \n\n\n\n### Notes:\n1. @Alice forked and edited the flipside script to improve it & increase accuracy to track voting participation. here's the new script : https://dune.com/queries/2970451\n2. The voting requirement was lowered to 70% from 80% to include Michigan & HKUST. Ideally, all recognized delegates would maintain an 80% participation rate. However, considering the summer break and the involvement of student delegates, a more lenient approach was adopted this quarter.\n3. The script was updated to track better gas spent by Gnosis Safes, benefiting both TokenLogic & HKUST. This improvement was a joint effort by @JosepBove & @MarcZeller.\n[the output of the script can be seen here](https://aavechan.notion.site/Gas-rebate-August-2023-Script-output-d611e6123ffb4397b61d94c73e64c8c7?pvs=4)\njust like last quarter, amounts have been rounded strictly up to the second decimal place for more straightforward AIP implementation.\n4. Some delegates, including ACI & Tokenlogic, are transitioning from old addresses to new ones. This transition was considered when determining eligibility for the rebate.\n5. Proposal creation & execution expenses were covered. Service providers interested in having their costs covered can discuss this in this thread. Payload deployments are not covered this quarter due to technical reasons.\n6. Instead of wETH, it is proposed to distribute ETH directly this quarter for ease of use for all delegates.\n\n## Disclaimer:\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward. The Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC.\n\n## Next Steps:\n1. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
