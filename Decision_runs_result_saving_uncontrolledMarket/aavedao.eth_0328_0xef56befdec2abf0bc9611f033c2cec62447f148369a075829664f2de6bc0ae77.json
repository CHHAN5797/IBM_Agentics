As we [highlighted](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-optimal-borrow-rates-for-ethereum-stablecoin-markets/15096/3) in the recent proposal, we recommend a more aggressive increase of the Slope1 parameter to stabilize borrows under the UOptimal point.\n\n### Previous IR Curve modification impact analysis\n\n**Stablecoins Total Supply and Borrow:** The data from the charts reflects an overall increase in both the supply and borrowing of stablecoins on the Ethereum V3 platform. From November 25th to December 12th we observed the following increases in supply and borrow across USDC, USDT, and DAI:\n \n![image](ipfs://Qma9SeLwfVs7v6gFVLdQsGR8pHWVkiK8xnNjncMLFmmKEe)\n    \nWe’ve observed an overall $49M increase (20.8%) in supply across USDC, USDT and DAI on Ethereum V3, and a $104M increase (45.4%) in borrows.\nThis general uptrend suggests that the AIP's changes were well received, with higher utilization for the assets following the parameter updates.\n\n![Frame 78017.png](ipfs://QmZrFJXLiYdXkHazHzhQU9ztciMZhbmZW91fosSsPbS2k3)\n\n \n![Frame 78018.png](ipfs://QmapwiVXKY9F8LAToEgAJMLTJUTD8qaHjM4jvHCtyCPfAF)\n    \n\n**Utilization Rate Analysis:** Our continuous monitoring of the utilization rates post AIP-375, setting Slope1 at 5%, shows sustained demand. When looking at the percentage of times in which utilization was above UOptimal, we can see that the AIP-375 increase didn’t stabilize the utilization at or below the UOptimal. This could also be due to changing market dynamics with the recent increase in crypto asset prices.\n\nDuring two distinct 16-day intervals, we observed the following:\n\n- **Pre-AIP-375 Period (11.09.23 - 11.25.23)**\n- **Post-AIP-375 Period (11.25.23 - 12.12.23)**\n\n**Percentage of Time of Utilization Above UOptimal:**\n\n| Asset | Before AIP-375 | After AIP-375 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USDC | 69.53% | 77.34% |\n| USDT | 63.02% | 33.09% |\n| DAI | 48.70% | 63.24% |\n\n \n![Frame 78019 (1).png](ipfs://QmeVmhQjvUfCyx8X1Dioriz5rmcMQNVP4xRr1bcGomF3Ye)\n    \nThe data demonstrates strong borrowing activity persisting after the interest rate curve adjustments, supporting a move towards higher interest rates. This pattern reflects a consistent, resilient demand among the top stablecoins on Ethereum V3.\n\n**Borrow Rate Analysis:** After executing the previous proposal, we continue to observe fluctuations in borrow rates, suggesting the previous increase did not achieve the anticipated stabilization. This situation suggests that further adjustments of the interest rate parameters are necessary to achieve more consistent and stable borrowing rates.\n\n \n![Frame 78020.png](ipfs://QmNRDSTSAK1TabFokii9ds53YVHf2kSYnFHiDQch2Ka5tA)\n    \n![403641469_370769045314386_6540288414402371375_n (1).png](ipfs://QmdnPzCUb37oWHbQPEShZrGnD3NxxTtWnRAZMpTZ63UHgR)\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Adjust Slope1 of stablecoins to 6%**\n\nThe analysis indicates a necessity for further refinement of stablecoin interest rates, to achieve a more predictable and stable borrowing rate with an equilibrium utilization under the UOptimal point. \nTherefore, we propose increasing Slope1 to 6% for stablecoins across all Aave deployments, in this iteration. Following this increase, we will continue monitoring the usage and equilibrium rate and make additional recommendations as necessary. \n\n# Specification\n\n| Market | Asset | Current Slope1 | Rec Slope1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | sUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | GUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V2 | USDP | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Ethereum V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V2 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Avalanche V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V2 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Polygon V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | sUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Optimism V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDC.e | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | DAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | LUSD | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | FRAX | 5% | 6% |\n| Arbitrum V3 | MAI | 5% | 6% |\n| Base V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Metis V3 | USDC | 5% | 6% |\n| Metis V3 | USDT | 5% | 6% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

Although the exact cause of this shift is still under investigation, it appears linked to the unique aAMPL implementation. Specifically, the scaled total supply of the underlying AMPL in the market, and thus by proxy aAMPL supply, seems to rebase irrespective of the utilization rate, in addition to the high interest rates realized by the aAMPL. In the expected implementation however, suppliers and/or borrowers will proportionately receive daily AMPL rebases in accordance with the utilization of the underlying market (where utilization of 100% = zero to AMPL suppliers and 0% = only to AMPL suppliers).\n\nWith minimal withdrawals and 100% utilization rate over the last month and a half, it seems as though the correlation has only gotten stronger. Given the rampant growth in aAMPL supply whilst total supplied liquidity has stayed constant, & aAMPL withdrawals are naturally credited 1:1 with underlying AMPL, there is currently a predicament whereby current aAMPL holders cannot be paid out their effective claims on the market. The development of a fair method for distributing these claims, or any potential reimbursement strategy, will be formulated in the upcoming days and weeks, once we have a clearer understanding of the core issue. As such, given the AMPL market's frozen status since Nov 27th, 2022, and the ongoing deprecation of the market (including setting the RF to 99% on Dec 17th, 2023), suggesting a decrease in slope2 from 300% to 0% could alleviate the interest rate's impact on aAMPL supply growth, even if primarily realized by the Aave collector. This adjustment seeks to analyze the influence on the relative exponentiation within the current aAMPL supply, and would leave the 20% base rate intact.\n\n# **Specification**\n\n| Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Base | 20% | No Change |\n| Slope1 | 0% | No Change |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 0% |\n| Uoptimal | 80% | No Change |\n| Reserve Factor | 99.00% | 99.90% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce Liquidation Threshold (LT) and Loan-To-Value (LTV), for CRV on Aave V2 Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFollowing our recommendations to decrease Aave’s exposure to CRV on V2 Ethereum [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-recommendation-to-freeze-crv-and-set-crv-ltv-0-on-aave-v2/13644/31), we propose a series of LT and LTV reductions. The [first reduction](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/255/) in this cycle of LT updates was executed on July 3rd, 2023. Since the initial post proposing to reduce the LTs for CRV, we’ve observed over 12M CRV withdrawn from V2 Ethereum. \n\nGiven the current conditions and protocol usage, we propose 2 options for the community to vote on:\n\n1. “Aggressive” (Chaos recommended) - 6% reduction. This option suggests an LT configuration that optimizes the reduction without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure, which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://www.notion.so/chaos-labs/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-CRV-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-7-10-32dc4ed994be4029b05af831ce5ea537).\n2. “Moderate” - 3% reduction. This option is aligned with the previous reduction and the [Risk-Off Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreigdmcfmwvnxfolpds4xkdicgrszgmknig7pz2r2t37tltupdpyfu4) previously approved by the community, with a reduction of up to 3% in any given AIP.\n\nIn the table below, we share data to quantify and visualize the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users. \n\n| Option | Liquidation Threshold | Accounts Liquidated | Liquidation Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Moderate | 52 | 3 | $46 |\n| Aggressive | 49 | 5 | $116 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current Value | Recommendation | Change |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRV | LT | 55 | 52 / 49 | -3% / -6% |\n| CRV | LTV | 49 | 46 / 43 | -3% / -6% |\n\n*Recommended LT and LTV values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the “aggressive” and “moderate” options*\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

The following proposal is the first step to reduce capital efficiency across V2 collateral assets, which will be followed up with more detailed plans for additional parameter updates for these assets. \n\n### LT Reductions\n\nImplementing a gradual decrease in LTs effectively diminishes the borrowing power for the existing markets. This proposal offers the community two alternatives - a \"moderate\" and an \"aggressive\" approach for the preliminary LT reduction. \n\n- Aggressive (Chaos Recommendation) -  This option suggests a LT configuration that optimizes reductions without significantly increasing the number of accounts eligible for liquidation. The proposed values are set at a margin of 8% from the closest LT figure which would trigger more substantial liquidations, as can be seen in the supporting graphs [here](https://chaos-labs.notion.site/Supporting-Data-ARFC-Chaos-Labs-Risk-Parameter-Updates-Aave-V2-Ethereum-2023-6-23-338308b47db34c30a92204805f2a1972?pvs=4).\n- Moderate - If the community leans towards a more tempered approach of slowly reducing the Liquidation Thresholds, we propose limiting the LT decrease to a maximum of 10%. Hence, we define the “Moderate” option as the minimum between 10% or the value suggested by the aggressive approach.\n\n- “Aggressive”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 55% | $60 | 5 |\n| BAT | 70% | 52% | $610 | 6 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 42% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 1% | $1,790 | 7 |\n| MANA | 75% | 62% | $500 | 5 |\n| REN | 60% | 40% | $1,800 | 6 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|45%|$500 | 5 |\n- “Moderate”\n\n| Asset | Current LT | Rec LT | Value Liquidated | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% | 0 | 2 |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% | $200 | 3 |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 0 | 1 |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | $300 | 4 |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% | $210 | 1 |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% | $400 | 4 |\n| REN | 60% | 50% | $300 | 4 |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 0 | 0 |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | $500 | 2 |\n|ZRX|65%|55%| 0 | 0|\n\nIn the tables below, we share data to quantify the effect of the recommended reductions on protocol users:\n\n|  | Value liquidated | Accounts liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| moderate | $1,970 | 20 |\n| aggressive | $4,900 | 34 |\n\n*As Liquidation Threshold reductions may lead to user accounts being eligible for liquidations upon their approval, we want to clarify the full implications to the community at each step. Chaos Labs will publicly communicate the planned amendments and list of affected accounts leading to the on-chain execution.*\n\n### Reduce LTV to zero\n\nLowering the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to zero can potentially curb borrowing by less sophisticated users. It's important to note that due to V2's design, users can bypass the LTV limit to borrow up to the LT value.\n\n### RF Increase\n\nProgressively increasing the reserve factors diminishes the interest rate for providing these assets and lowers the suppliers' incentive to supply the assets. In this proposal, we suggest an initial hike of 10% for all inactive assets.\n\n### LB Increase\n\nWe recommend increasing the LB for all proposed assets (excluding BAL and CVX) to 10% to better incentivize liquidations and accommodate for low liquidity for the given assets.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Asset | Cur LT | Rec LT* | Current LTV | Rec LTV | Current RF | Rec RF | Current LB | Rec LB |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BAL | 70% | 60% / 55% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8% | 8% |\n| BAT | 70% | 60% / 52% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| CVX | 45% | 40% | 35% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 8.5% | 8%  |\n| DPI | 70% | 60% / 42% | 65% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ENJ | 67% | 60% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 6% | 10% |\n| KNC | 70% | 60% / 1% | 60% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 10% | 8%  |\n| MANA | 75% | 65% / 62% | 61.5% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| REN | 60% | 50% /40% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| xSUSHI | 65% | 60% | 50% | 0 | 35% | 45% | 8.5% | 10% |\n| YFI | 65% | 55% | 50% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n| ZRX | 65% | 55% / 45% | 55% | 0 | 20% | 30% | 7.5% | 10% |\n\n*Recommended LT values will be finalized after the Snapshot between the aggressive and moderate options\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to increase the debt ceiling of MKR on V3 Ethereum\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum, set at $6M, has reached 100% utilization. \n\nGiven current market conditions and improved liquidity for MKR on Ethereum over the past months, our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling for MKR to $8.5M. \n\nIt is important to note that the majority of MKR debt positions are concentrated within two accounts, accounting for over 80% of the total debt, as outlined below. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0) -  borrowing $3.11M DAI against his 5,914 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 52% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2. [0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05) -  borrowing $1.84M USDC against his 4,077 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 31% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 2.06.\n\n## Specification:\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | Debt Ceiling | 6,000,000 | 8,500,000 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
