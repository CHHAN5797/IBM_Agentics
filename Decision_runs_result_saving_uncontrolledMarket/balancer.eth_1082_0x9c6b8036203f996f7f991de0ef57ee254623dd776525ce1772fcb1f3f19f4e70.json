This two-asset pool establishes a critical link between **RZR** and **Ethereum-native liquidity**, positioning wstETH as the primary routing asset. By providing a robust liquidity venue for trading between RZR and wstETH, this pool enhances utility, accessibility, and capital efficiency across the ecosystem.\n\nA **Balancer gauge** for this pool would enable **BAL emissions** to be directed toward it, encouraging deeper and more persistent liquidity. This not only improves swap efficiency and reduces slippage for users but also establishes **Balancer as the primary liquidity venue for RZR** on Ethereum Mainnet. Additionally, increased pool depth will strengthen broader protocol integrations, including **reserve-backed lending, stablecoin liquidity routing, and cross-chain liquidity pathways** leveraging RZR.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** The protocol is behind a 1 day timelock with a 3/4 multisig with plans to become a fully decentralized DAO with RZR token holders placing votes in the ecosystem. See https://rezerve.gitbook.io/protocol/security/timelocked-multisig-admin\n2. **Oracles:** The protocol relies heavily on eOracle https://rezerve.gitbook.io/protocol/security/oracles\n3. **Audits:** The protocol has inherited the audits from OlympusDAO but has also conducted an independent audit with Halborn. https://rezerve.gitbook.io/protocol/security/audits\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Besides the multisig + timelock there is no centralization vector. The project was launched as fairly as possible.\n5. **Market History:** There has not been any major price deviations on the project. [https://dexscreener.com/sonic/0x08c5e3b7533ee819a4d1f66e839d0e8f04ae3d0c](https://dexscreener.com/sonic/0x08c5e3b7533ee819a4d1f66e839d0e8f04ae3d0c)\n6. **Value:** Is this pool intended to be the primary source of liquidity for the token(s)? Yes\n\n### Technical specification\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: gauge(address):`0x14c80b2822c908b9af601ccebe50124c050518ca` \ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Holders of tETH earn real yield in excess of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage while still being able to use tETH for DeFi activities. \n\nThe Treehouse Protocol team proposes a Balancer Gauge for the tETH-wstETH pool on Ethereum with no emissions cap. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n\n* Website - [Treehouse | Decentralized Fixed Income Layer](https://treehouse.finance/)\n* Documentation - [Treehouse Finance Docs](https://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol) \n* CoinGecko - [tETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/treehouse-eth)\n*  Github Page - [Treehouse - gaia](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia)\n* Discord - [Treehouse](https://discord.com/invite/treehousefi)\n* Twitter - [x.com](https://x.com/TreehouseFi)\n* Gauge deposit contract - [tETH/wstETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862)\n* Protocol Audits - [Treehouse audits](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nTreehouse is a protocol that is building the decentralized fixed income layer for digital assets. Its main product offerings, tAssets and the Decentralized Offered Rate (DOR), were developed to address a critical gap in the fixed income digital assets market and set a standard for decentralized reference rates.\n\ntETH, the first tAsset deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, is a liquid staking token (LST) that converges the fragmented on-chain ETH interest rates market. Holders of tETH earn real yield exceeding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage across various lending and borrowing protocols, all while retaining the ability to use tETH for other DeFi activities.\n\nSince its launch, the tETH vault has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140 million worth of ETH within just a month and a half.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nTreehouse Protocol is working to establish the tETH-wstETH Gauge on Balancer to enhance the liquidity of tETH. Increased liquidity facilitates smoother entry and exit for traders and investors, which is essential for the overall usability and appeal of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) within the DeFi ecosystem. This liquidity boost not only supports market efficiency but also attracts more participants to the Balancer ecosystem, where the tETH-wstETH pool will generate yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** All ownable contracts are secured with a 5/7 multi-sig. Only the tETH contract is upgradable for future expansion plans.\n\n2. **Oracles:** [tETH-wstETH rate provider](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c53f86d9a6b01821f916802a7606e9255dfe4e2) is based on wstETH as a base asset, it is not compatible with any pools aside from a wstETH pairing for the intended use of a rate provider.\n\n4. **Audits:** Treehouse Protocol has been audited by entities such as Fuzzland, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits and the reports can be seen in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n5. **Centralization vectors:** The centralization vector primarily involves the execution of actions in the strategy contract which are done by a multi-sig appointed by the contract owner. However, all action contracts are well-defined and the executors can only perform the whitelisted actions included in the strategy contract.\n\n6. **Market History:** tETH has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140M worth of ETH since its launch on 10th September 2024. The tETH-wstETH Balancer pool has been in inception since 23 October 2024. More information about tETH and the Treehouse Protocol ecosystem can be found on the [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/treehouseprotocol/treehousefi).\n-[tETH-wstETH pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x1d13531bf6344c102280ce4c458781fbf14dad140000000000000000000006df)\n-[tETH-wstETH pool gauge](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862)\n \n8. **Value:** The tETH-wstETH pool on Balancer is designed to be a key source of liquidity for the token on the Ethereum network. By pairing tETH with wstETH, the pool aims to provide a seamless trading experience while also offering enhanced rewards for liquidity providers. This structure is intended to optimize both liquidity and profitability within the ecosystem. In addition, users who stake their tETH-wstETH LP tokens will be able to earn points from our current ongoing points program.\n\n**Transaction Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

Element Finance offers fixed-rate solutions and is in preparation for a version 2 (v2) upgrade. The initial version, Element v1, utilized a yield-splitting mechanism that separated principal tokens from yield tokens with defined term lengths. This system allowed users to leverage variable yields in one type of trade, while in another, it provided predictable fixed rates, permitting the acquisition of principal tokens at a discount. The upcoming v2 upgrade is designed to introduce continuous liquidity, *eliminating* the need for preset expiration dates, fragmented liquidity, and LP rollovers. The proposed changes aim to enhance LP efficiency and term underwriting substantially.\n\n**Motivation:** Element Finance is evaluating optimal trading platforms for the ELFI token. Balancer stands out as a potential primary platform, given its features and liquidity management capabilities. The establishment of the ELFI-WETH pool on Balancer supports this direction, aiming to bolster liquidity and trading efficiency. With the integration of this pool gauge and potential BAL incentives, Element Finance seeks to fortify its trading presence on the mainnet.\n\n> Explain why this pool needs incentivisation\n\nThere should be a prioritization in rewarding governance token holders who provide liquidity, recognizing their pivotal role in the protocol's ecosystem. Introducing the ELFI/WETH pool on Balancer aligns with this goal, especially considering the potential future plans to integrate this pool into a voting vault. This integration will enable ELFI/WETH LP tokens to be counted as votes, strengthening governance participation.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** [Provide current information on the protocol’s governance structure. Provide links to any admin and/or multisig addresses, and describe the powers afforded to these addresses. If there are plans to change the governance system in the future, please explain.]\n\n>https://docs.element.fi/governance-council/council-protocol-overview\nElement Finance DAO has implemented the Council Protocol as its main governance system.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles? If so, provide details about the oracles and their implementation in the protocol.\n\n> N/A\n\n3. **Audits:** Provide links to audit reports and any relevant details about security practices.\n\n> TBD for v2 (Completed or on-going audits are not public at the moment)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Is there any component of the protocol that has centralization vectors? E.g. if only 1 dev manages the project, that is a centralized vector. If price oracles need to be updated by a bot, that is a centralized vector. If liquidations are done by the protocol, that is also a centralization vector.\n\n> N/A\n\n5. **Market History:** Has the asset observed severe volatility? In the case of stablecoins, has it depegged? In the case of an unpegged asset, have there been extreme price change events in the past? Provide specific information about the Balancer pool: how long has it been active, TVL, historical volume? **You must provide a direct link to the pool AND a link to your pool's gauge.**\n\n>https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x10f8ea49255e8a865ca4eda1630168c85cc8ee810002000000000000000005d3 - this is the existing Balancer pool with no significant trading history.\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xD5417ACb575c799cEB373f85AdF100C7cD84C8c8 - this is the link to the pool gauge.

If this is not the case, explain the expected value add to Balancer (can this pool generate consistent fees?)\n\n> The intention is for this pool to be the primary source of liquidity for ELFI.\n\nELFI/WETH\n\nPool: 0x10f8EA49255e8a865ca4edA1630168C85cC8ee81](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x10f8ea49255e8a865ca4eda1630168c85cc8ee810002000000000000000005d3)\n\nGauge (2% Cap): [0xD5417ACb575c799cEB373f85AdF100C7cD84C8c(https://etherscan.io/address/0xD5417ACb575c799cEB373f85AdF100C7cD84C8c8)\n\n**Specifcations:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xD5417ACb575c799cEB373f85AdF100C7cD84C8c8`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`",

As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.\n> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implements the agreed-upon changes to the platform. Further information may be found here: ANKR Governance Mechanics – Ankr\n> 2. **Oracles:** Rate provider for [ankrETH ](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xCb0006B31e6b403fEeEC257A8ABeE0817bEd7eBa).\n> 3. **Audits:** Ethereum Liquid Staking smart contracts have undergone an external audit by Beosin Blockchain Security. The full audit report may be found below:\n> [Ethereum Liquid Staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/eth/overview/#audit-details)\n> 4. **Centralization vectors:** Centralisation Vectors: The Ankr 2.0 whitepaper introduced the vision for Ankr Network as a decentralized system where independent node operators work alongside Ankr nodes to power the growth and development of Web3. Further detailed information may be found here:\n> [Delegated ANKR token staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/delegated-staking/ankr/overview/)\n> 5. **Market History:** https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ankr-staked-eth\n> 6. **Value:** The pool is intended to be the primary source of liquidity for ankrETH liquidity on Arbitrum and allow for a healthy stimulation of volume.\n\nPool address: [0x9f8ed1acfe0c863381b9081aff2144fc867aa773](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x9f8ed1acfe0c863381b9081aff2144fc867aa7730002000000000000000004d4)\nGauge address: [0x4e15b9184553740f5C822bd3d6169029D302e63e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e15b9184553740f5C822bd3d6169029D302e63e#code)\n\n**Specification**:\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address):`0x4e15b9184553740f5C822bd3d6169029D302e63e`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nAdditionally, this pool is requesting core pool status as per BIP-457",
