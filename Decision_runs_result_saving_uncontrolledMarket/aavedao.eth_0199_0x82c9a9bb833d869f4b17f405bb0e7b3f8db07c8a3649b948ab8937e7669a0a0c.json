        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 MVP deployment on Neon EVM Mainnet\n\nAuthor: Neon Foundation & Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)\n\nCreated: 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary:\n\nThis TEMP CHECK proposes the deployment of Aave V3 MVP on the NEON EVM Mainnet, expanding Aave’s presence and enabling access to unaddressed users, liquidity, community and ecosystem of Solana.\n\n# Background:\n\nNeon EVM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment solution built on the Solana blockchain which makes it the first parallelized EVM with direct access to Solana liquidity. Neon EVM allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps on Solana and access its native ecosystem and network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities without changing their codebases. Neon EVM currently has interoperability with Solana SPL tokens and the plan is to develop full interoperability with Solana smart contracts as well in 2024.\n\nSolana is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. Solana ecosystem took a hit due to market conditions and FTX situation last year as TVL fell from all-time high of +$9b to +$250m in July 2023 but since then it has shown strong growth and it’s the fastest growing ecosystem across major blockchain networks. Current TVL is over $1.5b making it the fifth-largest chain by TVL.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave has emerged as a prominent player in DeFi lending across various EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) networks, including Ethereum, alt L1s, and L2s. Neon EVM wants to further support the mission of a multi-chain Aave and proposes deploying Aave v3 on the Neon EVM Mainnet to expand lending to the Solana ecosystem. Aave’s expansion to the largest non-EVM ecosystem will further reinforce its place as the top liquidity market on-chain and open up possibilities for growth and collaboration between the Aave, Solana, and Neon EVM communities.\n\nAave V3 deployment on Neon EVM will enable Aave to access the deep liquidity on Solana and enables Solana ecosystem users to get access to the premier lending protocol through Neon EVM. The platform will allow Aave to deploy on Solana without any reconfiguration of the Aave v3 codebase and hence without incurring major development efforts and costs to the Aave DAO. Also, a third-party team has already deployed Aave V3 fork on Neon EVM Devnet which implies the full compatibility of Aave V3 codebase with Neon EVM.\n\nThese benefits of Neon EVM combined with Aave’s impressive push for a cross-chain future, provide an exciting opportunity to capture the market share of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and grow the user base and community of the protocol, increase TVL, and protocol revenue. At the same time, Neon EVM would benefit from having a trusted, flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users and wider Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe deployment of Aave v3 on the Neon EVM would enable Aave to tap into the Solana DeFi market and make a unique and significant contribution to the decentralized finance movement. This deployment is expected to substantially reduce costs and better scalability in comparison to EVM networks, while also providing users with access to Solana’s liquidity and the overall ecosystem. As Solana gains momentum as a prominent blockchain platform, the integration of Aave’s advanced lending and borrowing protocol could further catalyze the DeFi ecosystem on Solana and Neon EVM.\n\nThere have been significant concerns around the Downtime of Solana blockchain in the past but continuous innovation is happening within the ecosystem and new tools are rolling out on a continuous basis to make the network more resilient, efficient and scalable. For e.g. Firedancer 2 by Jump Crypto.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of Aave v3 deployment on Neon EVM was also recently mentioned by Stani and contributing teams like Aave Chan Initiative (ACI). Tweet by Stani 26, Tweet by Marc Zeller 25\n\nAdditionally, Neon EVM also recently announced the launch of Neon Points Program 10 to attract users and builders to accelerate the adoption of the network. We will include Aave in our points program to incentivize user activity on Aave v3 on Neon EVM with boosted points.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM Mainnet with limited deployment of initial assets and conservative risk parameters.This approach will enable Aave to strategically establish a presence in the Solana ecosystem while minimizing risk exposure.\n\nThe proposal suggests three collaterals (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL 1) and one borrowable asset (USDC) with no isolated mode, e-mode enabled for correlated assets (SOL, mSOL, jitoSOL), conservative LTV and supply, borrow caps. If this proposal is to pass, we will conduct a comprehensive technical risk assessment for the suggested assets at the ARFC phase to determine their risk parameters. We also invite risk service providers and community members to provide their analysis.\n\n# Infraestructure\n\n- Documentation: [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/quick_start)\n\n- Compatibility with Ethereum RPC endpoints: Neon EVM supports almost all standards. Here is the link to supported JSON-RPC - [Neon EVM Docs](https://docs.neonevm.org/docs/evm_compatibility/json_rpc_api_methods)\n\n- Indexers: theGraph\n\n- Oracles: Chainlink, Pyth\n\n- Wallets: Metamask, Ledger and support other EVM network wallets.\n\n- Block explorers: [NeonScan](https://neonscan.org/),  [Blockscout](https://neon.blockscout.com/)\n\n- Address formatting: It is the same as the standard Ethereum address.\n\n- On-chain multi-signature infrastructure: Friendly fork of Gnosis Safe.\n\n- Cross-chain Interactions: [deBridge](https://debridge.finance/) ([announcement](https://twitter.com/deBridgeFinance/status/1737812739320599032), expected to go live on Mainnet in January)\n\n- NeonPass: NeonPass links Solana and Neon EVM to provide a smoother EVM-compatibility experience for end users (https://neonpass.live/). NeonPass is the revolving door of liquidity between Solana and Neon EVM. NeonPass is not a bridge connecting two separate blockchain ecosystems. Rather, it acts as a two-way transfer tool for bringing assets in and out of the Neon EVM platform, which itself is a Solana smart contract directly connected to the network.\n\n# Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Neon Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nThe co-author is a team member of Neon Foundation and holds SOL, NEON tokens.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\n1. Temperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on Neon EVM and proceed with Snapshot if positive.\n\n2. ARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\n3. AIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n# Copyright:\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "---\n\n### [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Aptos Mainnet \n### Author: @AptosFoundation\n###  Date: 2024-07-01\n\n---\n### Summary:\n\nThis Temperature Check seeks community input on deploying Aave V3 on Aptos to expand Aave’s presence and tap into Aptos’ growing DeFi ecosystem and user base.\n\n### Background:\n\nThe Aave Protocol has been EVM-native for over 6 years, ensuring widespread cross compatibility, a robust developer ecosystem, and significant network effects over the years both in terms of user base and liquidity. However, it also brings limitations, especially considering the existence of many non-EVM blockchains that offer different advantages such as lower transaction fees, higher throughput, and more advanced consensus mechanisms. In addition to purely technical advantages, many non-EVM blockchains can allow the Aave community to expand to an entirely new ecosystem, previously inaccessible user groups, and introduce new product possibilities.\n\nAptos is a blockchain designed for building scalable and secure dApps. Developed by former leaders of Meta's Diem blockchain project, it aims to address some of the limitations in existing blockchain systems such as throughput, scalability, and security. With a TVL of approximately $350m and growing rapidly, Aptos is the 17th largest chain by TVL (source: [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Aptos)). Its robust infrastructure offers high transaction throughput, low, predictable fees, and advanced security through the [Move programming language](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/why-move), that make Aptos an ideal platform for DeFi applications. The chain has a diverse array of [DeFi](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/defi) offerings, including prominent projects like Thala, Aries Markets, Amnis Finance, Econia, alongside primarily EVM-native projects such as Sushiswap and Pancake Swap. Aptos Labs Founders Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching have leveraged their extensive experience at Meta to propel Aptos towards becoming a leader in scalable and secure blockchain solutions. Moreover, Aptos has established high-profile partnerships with industry giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft, SK Telecom and many more others, further enhancing its technological capabilities and broadening its influence.\n\n*Advantages of Aptos*\n\nAptos offers several significant advantages that make it an ideal platform for high-demand applications. With its ability to handle over [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), it excels in supporting DeFi, real-time financial services, gaming, AI and other use cases. The platform's agile governance allows for rapid upgrades and swift implementation of new features. Additionally, Aptos ensures low and predictable fees through a stable fee model, and its use of the Move programming language enhances security with formal verification and resource-oriented programming. Built-in security features and automated auditing tools streamline the security process, while advanced state management techniques optimize data storage and access. Furthermore, Aptos simplifies integration with other blockchains through built-in interoperability, creating a cohesive and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos represents a groundbreaking expansion as it marks Aave’s first deployment on a non-EVM blockchain. This strategic move is significant as it opens up new technological frontiers, diversifies Aave’s ecosystem, and underscores its commitment to innovation.\n\nBy leveraging Aptos’ innovative technology and developer community, Aave can address diverse financial needs, attract new users, and drive greater innovation in the DeFi sector. This deployment aligns with the Aave community’s strategic goal to explore new technological possibilities and tap into a wider pool of talent and resources.\n\nKey benefits of deploying Aave V3 on Aptos include:\n\n1. First Non-EVM Deployment:\n\n  * This deployment is a significant milestone as Aave’s first move beyond EVM-compatible blockchains. It positions Aave to explore and integrate with new blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its resilience and broadening its reach.\n\n2. Early Mover Advantage and Strong Brand:\n\n  * Aave is a leading brand in the DeFi space, with a strong reputation and market share. By deploying on Aptos, Aave captures early mover advantages on a high-performance blockchain, similar to its strategic expansions to Polygon and other L2s. This can attract both seasoned DeFi users and new participants exploring Aptos.\n\n3. Aptos' Strategic Position:\n\n  * The Aptos team, with their background from Meta's Diem project, has strong connections and expertise in finance, social and gaming sectors. Integrating Aave into Aptos complements these areas by adding a mature financial layer, essential for a complete blockchain ecosystem.\n\n4. High Transaction Throughput:\n\n  * Aptos supports up to [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), crucial for DeFi protocols like Aave that handle a high volume of transactions, including loans, repayments, and interest accruals. This high throughput can significantly enhance user experience and enable new use cases that require high-frequency transactions.\n\n5. Enhanced Security with Move Language:\n\n  * Aave v3 introduces sophisticated risk management tools and improved security protocols. The Move programming language used by Aptos has inherent security advantages, such as preventing reentrancy attacks. This alignment can lead to a more secure DeFi lending environment, leveraging Move's safety features and formal verification.\n\n6. Transaction Cost Efficiency:\n\n  * Aave v3 focuses on gas efficiency, critical for reducing transaction costs. Aptos' efficient processing capabilities further complement this by potentially lowering transaction fees even more. This makes Aave more accessible and attractive to a broader range of users, from retail participants to institutional players.\n\n7. Modular and Flexible Architecture:\n\n  * Aave v3's modular and flexible architecture facilitates easier upgrades and expansions. Aptos supports upgradable smart contracts and a flexible account model, enhancing this aspect. This allows for seamless implementation of updates and improvements without significant disruptions or migrations.\n\n8. Economic Benefits for the Aave DAO:\n\n  * Market Share Growth: Access to new markets and user bases, specifically in APAC and Korea where Aptos has a strong presence.\n  * Revenue Growth: New markets and user bases can significantly increase transaction volumes and generate additional revenue streams.\n  * Incentives: Aptos Foundation has committed to provide up to 2M APT in liquidity mining incentives and rewards depending on performance in order to attract users and liquidity providers, increase adoption and boost the ecosystem’s growth. Aptos Foundation will work closely with Chaos Labs on determining the appropriate level of incentives relative to caps set.\n\nThe Move implementation on-going development code of Aave Protocol V3 can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/aptos-aave-v3).\n\nThe Aptos team is currently working with Aave Labs, Zellic, SpearBit and later in time with Certora and OtterSec on security reviews and improvements to the codebase to achieve high security standards. Aptos is sponsoring the audits.\n\n### ChainLink Integration:\n\nWe plan to integrate with ChainLink’s Price Feeds as the oracle provider for the market (currently in development), and with the recently [announced](https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/aptos-network-chainlink-data-feeds) Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enhance the functionality and security of Aave on Aptos.\n\nAsset and parameter settings would be discussed during ARFC.\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal published by the Aptos Foundation is intended for community feedback and does not represent a final decision. The deployment of Aave V3 on Aptos is subject to successful completion of all technical reviews, audits, and governance approvals. Aave Labs has built substantial expertise in the Move programming language and is prepared to proceed with the deployment pending community approval and further development steps. Aave Labs has been engaged as a technical contributor to implement the code version of the Aave Protocol into the Move programming language. Any actions taken based on this proposal should consider the inherent risks associated with blockchain deployments, including but not limited to technical, operational, and market risks. The information provided in this proposal is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial, legal, or technical advice.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n1.

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] New Chain Deployment Framework\nAuthor: @0xTogbe - Aave Chan Initiative\nCreated: 2023-11-28\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks the community’s approval for a framework to deploy the Aave Protocol on a new blockchain.\nThis framework outlines the standardized process for any blockchain seeking to deploy on Aave Protocol. The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired.

This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Integration Review: Outline the technical details of the proposed integration. This includes specifics on how Aave’s lending and borrowing functionalities will interact with new Aave Deployment. For that, please share the result of both documentation submission and technical review, from TEMP CHECK, so community can understand the level of work, security and commitment. Avoid providing sensitive information.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for ARFC phase, that has been as well implemented in TEMP CHECK stage, to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments.\n\nTo be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not, and details\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n\nSpecification: Include the initial assets that should be available as collateral and their risk parameters in a table. These should have received input from at least one risk manager service provider.\n\nDeployment Checklist: New deployments must have all of the following completed prior to posting an ARFC.\n\n- Risk service providers feedback\n- BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation\n- Oracle recommendation\n- The graph support\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nStatement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nRefine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\nIf consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\nIf consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 on the new chain.\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\n# Next Steps\n- Community Engagement: Engage with the Aave community to gather feedback on the proposed framework for new Aave v3 deployments.\n- ARFC Snapshot: If community sentiment is favorable, initiate an ARFC snapshot to gauge official support for the framework.\n- Implementation: Since this is a governance framework ARFC, if it passes snapshot, it will be implemented as the framework standard for new chain deployments going forward.\n# Disclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Activate and Deploy GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-27\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis proposal aims to establish a dedicated Safety Module for GHO, Aave's native stablecoin, on Arbitrum, to enhance the security and stability of the Aave Protocol.\n\nThe GHO Safety Module (GSM) will be similar to the existing Aave Safety Module (SM), providing an additional layer of protection against shortfall events and incentivizing stakeholders through rewards by using and staking GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nDeploying the GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum aligns with Aave's strategic goals of fostering a secure and scalable environment for its stablecoin. This proposal leverages Arbitrum's technological advantages and financial incentives, setting a solid foundation for GHO's growth and stability.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe [GHO Safety Module](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635) was created with the aim of mitigating risks using GHO’s stablecoin attributes for potential shortfall events, thereby fortifying the Aave Protocol’s resilience by adding a stablecoin asset, which is inherently less volatile than AAVE. This strategic move diversified the Safety Module’s capacity to absorb shocks from various risk vectors in case of shortfall events.\n\nCreating a GHO SM on Arbitrum responds to several factors:\n\n1. Scalability and low fees\n2. Strong Ecosystem and Liquidity injection\n\nCreating a GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum will ensure support and liquidity for GHO on Arbitrum.\n\nTo provide more context, Aave DAO recently received a Long Term Incentive Pilot Program Grant of 750K ARB from Arbitrum DAO, in order to expand GHO into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe funds would be used as follows:\n\n- 375K ARB distributed over a 12-week period amounts to around 1% additional yield to users. While this could be higher, it will be meaningful enough to make ETH and GHO borrows sufficiently attractive to boost TVL and borrow metrics.\n- 375K ARB used for GHO liquidity mining rewards. To target a sufficient size of GHO liquidity on the network, reward rates will need to be similar to mainnet. The GHO Liquidity Committee has used a mix of incentives to keep GHO at peg. We expect that a similar yield will be needed to manage the GHO peg on Arbitrum.\n\nTogether, these two uses of the grant funds should increase TVL and borrowing demand on Arbitrum. Arbitrum will be one of the most attractive networks to borrow on Aave due to the borrowing incentives. It will be the most appealing L2 to borrow and use GHO when it goes cross-chain.\n\nAnother example is the recent approval by Aave DAO of the [GHO Cross-Chain Launch strategy for the GHO](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2a6ffbcff41a5ef98b7542f99b207af9c1e79e61f859d0a62f3bf52d3280877a) stablecoin, the native asset of the Aave Protocol, beginning with the initial expansion to the Arbitrum network. This expansion will utilize the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).\n\n### **Specification**\n\n1. **Deployment of GHO Safety Module on Arbitrum**:\n    - Establish the GHO SM smart contracts on Arbitrum to manage and protect GHO assets.\n    - Integrate Chainlink oracles for accurate and reliable price feeds.\n2. **Incentive Program**:\n    - Utilize ARB incentives to bootstrap GHO liquidity and adoption on Arbitrum.\n    - Implement liquidity mining programs and other yield strategies to attract and retain GHO holders.\n3. **Merit Incentive Program**:\n    - Stakeholders who participate in staking GHO on Arbitrum will be eligible for Merit rewards. The Merit program is designed to incentivize both borrowing and staking GHO. The rewards will enhance user participation and the overall security of the GHO ecosystem on Arbitrum.\n\n### Useful Links:\n\n[**[ARFC] Upgrade Safety Module with StkGHO**](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-upgrade-safety-module-with-stkgho/15635)\n\n**[Aave LTIPP Council Recommended Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0x1a4d8072fce74d8fc069cf0ca33fb6348e3aa66ab6369dd3dbcaaff01f2cebbd)**\n\n**[[Aave] LTIPP Application](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aave-ltipp-application-final/21741)**\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nACI is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not being compensated for creating this TEMP CHECK.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1.
