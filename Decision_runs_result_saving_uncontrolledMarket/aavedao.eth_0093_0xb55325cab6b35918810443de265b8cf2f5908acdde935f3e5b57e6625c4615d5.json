Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.\n\nHaving recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).\n\nBenefits for Aave:\n\n* Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.\n* A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n* Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.\n* Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n* Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium's LTIPP.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\nContract Addresses:\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nEthereum: 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\nOptimism: 0x5a61374950D4BFa5a3D4f2CA36FC1d23A92b6f21\n\nUseful Links (the number of posted links is limited to 5 for new users, hence the intended spacing between \"h\" and \"ttps\"):\n\nProject: h ttps://www.threshold.network/\n\nMinting dashboard: h ttps://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint\n\nGitHub: h ttps://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2\n\nDocs: h ttps://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2\n\nAudit: h ttps://threshold.network/about#audits\n\nImmunfi Bug Bounty: h ttps://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/\n\nLlama Risk Report: https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/tBTC\n\nTwitter: h ttps://twitter.com/thetnetwork\n\nDiscord: h ttps://discord.gg/threshold\n\nDune: h ttps://dune.com/threshold/tbtc & h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n\n#### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThreshold Network has no link and is not compensated to present this TEMP CHECK proposal.\n\n#### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by native BTC. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for native BTC without a centralized custodian. It can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\ntBTC can be used as collateral, liquidity, a store of value, and can be integrated with DeFi apps across all supported blockchains.\n\nAs with other BTC wrappers, tBTC provides cryptocurrency traders and general users with a BTC-pegged token, that can be used to generate yield whilst holding native BTC.\n\n#### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nAdding support for tBTC on Aave V3 as an asset would allow tBTC holders to obtain a yield on their tBTC holdings.\n\nIn Aave’s [document hub](https://docs.aave.com/hub/), the first line self-describes Aave as “a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol”, Threshold Network is looking to help Aave fully realise this by allowing access to tBTC, which unlike its centralized competitor (wBTC), is the only way to permissionlessly borrow and lend BTC in a decentralized manner. This gives Aave direct access to the 1.3 trillion market and 106 million owners of BTC, for which wBTC provides limited access to.\n\n#### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n#### How is tBTC currently used?\n\ntBTC is currently used across the Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon and Solana ecosystems. tBTC exhibits strong usecase across decentralized exchanges, lending on Solana and Bitcoin Options on Base and as collateral for crvUSD, a broad overview can be found here:\nhttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\n\n#### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n#### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation\n\nThe Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:\n\nCouncil Multisig Ethereum Address: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\n#### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $195,000,000 USD / 2,960 BTC\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools: h ttps://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC\nDashboard on Decentralized LP liquidity: h ttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity\n\n#### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 7,251\nTwitter: 37,200\nGithub: 4,596 commits\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nDate of Deployment: February 2023\nNumber of transactions: 27,986\nNumber of token holders: 756\n\n#### Risk parameters\n\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams, we suggest the following risk parameters to start the conversation.\n\nSymbol: TBTC\n\nContract Addresses\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|Supply Cap|N/A|\n|Borrow Cap|2 Million USD|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|\n|LTV|35%|\n|LT|78%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Threshold Network.

Frax Finance has in the past done so in Aave v2 on Ethereum and has already stated on the Aave governance forum an interest in doing so on other deployments once FRAX is added.\n\nThe Frax Finance team could deploy a similar Aave Lending AMOs to Aave v3 after FRAX is listed.This will provide Aave users with access to FRAX and present an alternative to the four USD stable coins on Aave v3.\n\nUsers are able to borrow FRAX and earn yield across DeFi, such as on Curve Finance and Convex Finance.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?**\n\nThere is no link between the authors and the core teams of the asset.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token ?**\n\nSee summary.\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nFRAX is a popular stablecoin to borrow, with its Lending AMOs it is able to mint protocol-owned FRAX to ensure low interest rates.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nFRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.\n\n**5. How is the FRAX token currently used ?**\n\nFRAX is a popular stablecoin to borrow, with its Lending AMOs it is able to mint protocol-owned FRAX to ensure low interest rates.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nFRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.\n\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nThere is a multisig which can operate certain AMO contracts but cannot in any way change users’ FRAX balances, cannot freeze or pause any user’s funds, and cannot in any way alter the behavior of the protocol or sweep/rug collateral or value. There are no FRAX whitelists/blacklists in any capacity as it is entirely a bearer asset/decentralized exactly like DAI.\n\n**8.

Rocket Pools is expanding its support for rETH across the L2 ecosystem, first Optimism, now Arbitrum and soon Polygon. There are currently only Chainlink Oracles for Arbitrum and Ethereum. Thus, this publication presents listing rETH on Arbitrum ahead of Optimism.\n\nA new rETH liquidity pool and gauge has been created on Balancer v2 Arbitrum for rETH/bb-a-wETH. This pool will deposit wETH into Aave v3 on Arbitrum. Incentives are expected to follow soon. This publication is early and provides risk service providers adequate time to review the asset listing parameters whilst liquidity continues to grow.\n\nLST collateral types drive material borrowing revenue to Aave as users deposit the LST and borrow the corresponding network token. This is most evident on Ethereum where the LST- and wETH-yield-maximising loop is the source of the vast majority of wETH borrowing demand.\n\nBy providing LST diversification, Aave presents itself as a neutral platform offering users the choice between various LSTs. An added benefit of offering a variety of LSTs is the respective communities may elect to compete for user acquisition via Aave through offering incentives. This is currently happening on Aave v3 Polygon and Aave’s TVL has meaningfully increased from a relatively small base.\n\nRocket Pool offers Aave v3 users on Arbitrum an alternative to wstETH.\n\n# Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset ?**\n\nLlama does not receive any payments from Rocket Pool.\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token ?**\n\nRocket Pool strives to embody the core ethos of Ethereum and DeFi, specifically the non-custodial, trustless nature that allows self-sovereignty to truly thrive. This leads to reduced Counter Party risk relative to other LST providers.\n\nRocket Pool stakers deposit ETH into the deposit pool, enabling a node operator to create a new Ethereum Network validator. You can stake as little as 0.01 ETH.\n\nIn doing so, users are given a token called rETH. rETH represents both how much ETH is deposited, and when the user deposited it. The ratio includes rewards that Rocket Pool node operators earn from:\n\n* The Ethereum network itself\n* Priority fees from block proposals\n* MEV rewards from block proposals\n\nrETH is a staked, interest earning wrapper of ETH that can be exchanged at any time. rETH is not a rebasing token and therefore represents a straight forward integration prospect for Aave.\n\nSince the Beacon Chain rewards, priority fees, and MEV rewards will constantly accumulate, this means that rETH's value effectively always increases relative to ETH. The rETH/ETH exchange rate is updated approximately every 24 hours based on the Ethereum network rewards earned by Rocket Pool node operators.\n\n![|602x436](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sMlYJ-qPHfY2tYHe1Mhs1wJksUHoMuahfUR_vD-nFYn3vVC34buszhgTZv8oSjGQVTKUsGLm1jzBlkLCoR1bN_gGG6QWZyxiXkHFeFvxympIK7fw8zOjmGqI-Qsw-ErQBhruZk_eby90o8WwKgescPc)\n\nFor details on how to stake ETH with Rocket Pool, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/). For those readers keen to learn more about rETH taxation implications, please refer to this link [here](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/staking/overview.html#the-reth-token).\n\n**3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nBy listing rETH as collateral, users benefit from staking rewards whilst taking out a loan.\n\nSimilar to other LSTs, there are a range of yield maximising strategies and lower carry cost leveraged trading strategies that users could deploy. Given the typically low borrowing cost for LSTs, users are able to borrow the LST and participate in yield strategies beyond the Aave protocol.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nRocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH development.\n\nRocket Pool is designed to cater to two main user groups; those that wish to participate in [tokenised staking using rETH](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-2-5-tokenised-staking-48601d52d924#92b0) using as little as 0.01 ETH and those that wish to stake ETH and run a node in the network to help generate a higher return on investment than staking outside of the protocol due to commissions earned.\n\nFor more information on these two groups that make up the protocol, we'd highly recommend [reading article one in our explainer series](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd) that goes into great detail on how users can participate, be it via tokenised staking or running a node in the protocol.\n\nThe core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party. This is a principle directly linked to Ethereum and ETH itself, and a mindset used at every stage of the process as Rocket Pool has evolved.\n\n![|602x216](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fqwfASEawOZPpIGTuda282owPW_7OJNQ2sK-XLi1Bq4Y09EpnHnfcehIr7n-3jHDqu02Iw676wV8RwPq0KcoUn9V1wtRRXGDF-wCRDdRO5_atRmJ2x2UjjkDRlv9zbOV2hcV1-hcevUGvulZOzLIGJI)\n\n**5. How is the rETH token currently used ?**\n\nThe distribution of rETH is spread thinning across many addresses. According to Arbiscan, the largest holding is only 3.13% of supply on Arbitrum.\n\nrETH is new to Arbitrum and because of this, there are only a few extrinsic use cases. Providing liquidity on DEXs is one of the main use cases to date on mainnet and we expect this to be mirrored on Arbitrum. The new rETH/bb-a-wETH pool will soon receive incentives and will bootstrap a second liquidity pool complementing the existing Uniswap v3 pool.\n\nWith supporting liquidity and an oracle derived from DEX and CEX liquidity across several networks, Aave is positioned to be the dominant rETH lending/borrowing liquidity pool on Arbitrum. For reference, there is currently [$20.03M](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc6393&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) of rETH deposits on Aave v3 Ethereum.\n\nFor further insights into how rETH is integrated across the ecosystem, please refer to this Rocket Pool community-maintained Defi Opportunities publication.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThere is no emission schedule. rETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\n* The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities\n\n**8.

FRAX is currently the [#7 largest stablecoin by market cap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins) (1B) according to Coingecko. FRAX has also never lost peg a single time in its existence (defined as more than 1 cent price deviation on each side).\n\nFRAX currently has the largest Curve pool on Ethereum mainnet with almost $900M in liquidity and is a Uniswap top 10 token. Additionally, FRAX has already been successfully lent out on Aave v2 on ETH mainnet for many months and is a popular borrowable stable coin with no issues of unpegging or economic problems.\n\nFRAX is also already deployed natively on Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum and Optimism where Aave v3 resides.\n\n# Motivation\n\nFRAX can use its Lending AMO (similar to Maker’s DAI Direct Deposit Module) to mint protocol controlled FRAX to be lent out on Aave Protocol. Frax Finance has in the past done so in Aave v2 via an Aave Lending AMO. \n\nThe Frax Finance team could deploy a similar Aave Lending AMOs to Aave v3 after FRAX is listed.This will provide Aave users with access to FRAX and present an alternative to the three USD stable coins on Aave v3.\n\n\nUsers are able to borrow FRAX and earn yield across DeFi, such as on Curve Finance and Convex Finance.\n\n# Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n*  There is no link between the authors and the core teams of the asset.\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n*  See summary.\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n*  FRAX is a popular stablecoin to borrow, with its Lending AMOs it is able to mint protocol-owned FRAX to ensure low interest rates.\n4. Emission schedule\n*  FRAX is a stablecoin and mintable/redeemable so it does not have a governance token emission schedule.\n5. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n*  There is a multisig which can operate certain AMO contracts but cannot in any way change users’ FRAX balances, cannot freeze or pause any user’s funds, and cannot in any way alter the behavior of the protocol or sweep/rug collateral or value. There are no FRAX whitelists/blacklists in any capacity as it is entirely a bearer asset/decentralized exactly like DAI.\n6.
