Each of these proposals has already utilized or is likely to utilize stable coins held in the Ethereum Treasury:\n\n* 406,000 DAI - GHO Liquidity Committee\n* 420,159.28 DAI - Olympus DAO token swap\n* 600,000 USDC - Acquire AURA OTC with Aura Finance & AEF\n* Total of 1,426,159.28 stable coins\n\nThis publication proposes transferring 1.5M DAI from Polygon to Ethereum to replenish the stable coin reserves.\n\nAdditionally, the Aave DAO's BAL and CRV holdings will also be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum. These assets can then be integrated into the DAO's broader strategy for managing these assets on Ethereum.\n\nTo implement this proposal, the newly released [Aave Polygon-Mainnet ERC20Bridge](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-aave-swapper-and-strategic-asset-manager-contracts/14522/3) by Llama will be utilized.\n\n# Specification\n\nUsing the transfer the following assets from the Polygon to Ethereum Treasury.\n\n* All BAL\n* All CRV\n* 1,500,000 DAI\n\nThe DAI will be deposited into the DAI reserve on Aave v3. \n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

Users have been minting GHO and subsequently exchanging it for other assets.\n\nIncremental interest rate hikes have not had the desired effect, evident by GHO price continuing to trade lower. The GHO borrowing rate remains significantly lower compared to other stablecoins.\n\nThis publication suggests aligning the GHO borrowing rate with the proposed sDAI rate, 4.72%. The aim is to reduce the borrowing discount of GHO relative to other stablecoins before returning to periodic 50bps increases.\n\nThe chart below shows the general GHO price downwards trend. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByIPGWaz6.png)\n\nThe below shows the borrow rate of GHO relative to other stable coins. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryZgQWazp.png)\n\nThe main types of collateral backing GHO are wstETH (29.68%), wETH (28.84%), wBTC (20.44%) and rETH (8.94%). For reference, sDAI makes up 2.07% of the collateral supporting GHO debt with a current APR of [5.0%](https://daistats.com/#/ecosystem) which is expected to adjust lower to 4.72%. A large portion of the collateral backing GHO is generating yield which acts to offset borrowing costs.\n\nBy increasing the borrow rate to 4.72%, the goal is to improve the peg by reducing the incentive to mint GHO relative to other stable coins. As a result, GHO's growth is expected to slow. This publication prioritises returning GHO to peg over growth. \n\nAfter implementing this proposal, the community can continue with the current plan, [direct-to-AIP process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/349/). \n\n# Specification\n\nAsset: GHO\nContract Address: [0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f)\nCurrent Borrow Rate: [3.00%](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1255fC8DC8E76761995aCF544eea54f1B7fB0459#readContract)\nProposed Borrow Rate: 4.72%\nNew discounted Borrow Rate: ~3.31%\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\nThe Aave Facilitator Bucket Level is to remain at 35.00M units\n\nThe AIP will be submitted by @marcZeller and the ACI team.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2) In 5 days scalate this proposal to the Snapshot ARFC stage.\n3) If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.

The initial commit from the Aura Finance team was 400,000 units of vlAURA for an initial 3 month duration.\n\nThis proposal seeks to replace the support from Aura Finance by acquiring 443,674 units of AURA from Olympus DAO. Olympus DAO is reducing there AURA exposure due to change in the Olympus DAO roadmap which is detailed [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3756-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus) and [her](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3967-tap29-aura-solicitation-to-bid).\n\nBased upon the research presented in this [Update Balancer Ecosystem Holdings](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682), which details impact AIP-42 by Aura Finance, the most efficient way for Aave DAO to bootstrap GHO is via vlAURA relative to veBAL. \n\nOlympus DAO seeks payment in DAI, at an exchange rate of 0.9470 DAI per unit of AURA. The amount of AURA is 443,674 with a total cost to Aave DAO of 420,159.28 units of DAI. Aave DAO currently holds [2.873M](https://etherscan.io/token/0x028171bca77440897b824ca71d1c56cac55b68a3?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c) units of aDAI on Aave v2.\n\n**Olympus DAO is conducting an open forum auction over 3 day period, bids are placed relative to the spot price derived from the AURA/wETH pool on Balancer v2.\n\nThe USD price will be updated within this proposal progressively over the bidding period. Do note, Aave DAO's governance process duration exceeds that of Olympus DAO's which means Aave DAO's voting occurs afterwards and ultimately determines if/when the OTC swap will occur**\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will achieve the following:\n\n* Redeem 420,159.28 units aDAI from Aave v2\n* Exchange 420,159.28 units of DAI for 443,674 units of AURA with Olympus DAO\n\nFor reference, Olympus DAO AURA Holding Address: `0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B`\n\nThe contract shall be developed in collaboration with @MarcZeller and deployed by the ACI team.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Introducing StrategicAssetManager \nauthor: @Llamaxyz - @TokenLogic, @dydymoon & Fermin\ncreated: 2023-07-05\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThe `StrategicAssetManager` is a dedicated contract for managing Aave DAO's strategic assets. At launch the `StrategicAssetManager` will manage the DAO's veBAL holding.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave DAO is soon to attain a veBAL holding. To maximise the upside for holding the strategic asset, the DAO needs a practical means of managing the asset.\n\nThe veBAL holding needs to be continually relocked to optimise goverance and rewards. Gauge votes are weekly and would require numerous AIPs to manage the veBAL effectively. Aave DAO also has an opportunity to participate in Balancer's governance on Snapshot votes via delegating governance rights.\n\nThe StrategicAssetManage will also hold the sdCRV position if approved by AIP. Yield generated from each strategic holding can be claimed, swapped and redeposited to compound into each strategy over time. The swaps have MEV protection and can be customised to have defined maximum amount of price impact.\n\nGiven the sheer volume and frequency of transactions to be performed, there exists a desire to minimum AIP votes. The StrategicAssetManager contains the ability for the `ShortExecutor` to assign an `AssetManager`. This role can be likened to a Treasury Committee (as suggested Part 4 of SM upgrade publications) and provides the DAO optionality to introduce a committee separte from this proposal once adequate guidelines are in place. \n\nThe contract contains an allow list which implements tight restrictions around which contracts the `AssetManager` role can interact with. Further definition relating to what the `AssetManager` can do will be defined in the [ARFC] publication.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below provides a high level overview of the functionality provided by the StrategicAssetManager:\n\n* Deposit/withdraw voteEscrow contract \n* Lock/relock B-80BAL-WETH\n* Participate in gauge votes\n* Delegate governance voting rights\n* Allocate boost\n* Update boost\n* Delegate boost\n* Allow boost on Warden \n* List boost on Warden (if the  DAO votes for it)\n* Claim protocol fees & other rewards \n* Transfer assets (ie: collector contracts)\n* Ability to lock other strategic assets\n* Receive assets from the collector\n* Receive assets from the Economic Reserve\n\nThe contract is upgradeable and controlled by Aave's [`Short Executor`](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/governance-guide#the-short-executor-is-used-for-non-governance-related-proposals-such-as-asset-listing-parameter-upda) role via governance. Each function on the contract can be implemented via the `ShortExecutor` whilst also having the ability to assign and remove, a `AssetManager` role to a community elected address. There is also the possibility of having an IncentiveManager contract that could take on some of the listed functions defined above.
