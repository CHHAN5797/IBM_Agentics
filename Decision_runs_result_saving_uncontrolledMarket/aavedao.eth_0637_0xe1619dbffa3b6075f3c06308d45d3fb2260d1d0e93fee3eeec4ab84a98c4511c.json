        "body": "title: [ARFC] Add USDT to Ethereum V3 Market\n\nAuthor: @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative, @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham DeFi_Consulting\n\nDated: 2023-01-31\n\nSimple Summary\nThis proposal presents Aave with the opportunity to onboard USDT to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\nAbstract\nUSDT is a centralized stablecoin minted by Tether. for each unit of USDT in circulation; Tether holds a dollar or equivalent in short-term bonds or commercial paper.\n\nThis ARC is a joint effort with @Llamaxyz to allow a selection of assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Both Llama & ACI will propose AIPs on onboard assets on V3\n\nUSDT is currently one of the largest V2 stablecoin reserve with ~335m$ supplied\n\nMotivation\nSupporting stablecoin diversity is part of the Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI does not have any link nor is paid by Tether or any entity to present this ARC.\n\nThe risk parameters provided introduce USDT as a non-collateral asset.\n\nThe Interest rate Strategy curve is the same as for USDT in V2. for now.\nThe ACI is supportive of onboarding USDT as it was in V2.\nFor now, the ACI doesn’t consider V3 mature enough to activate a USD stablecoins emode and consider USDT in it.\nAlso, supply and borrow caps are suggested for this asset to limit risk exposure.\nThey’re currently set to allow reserve utilization to cross the Uoptimal point slightly. But @ChaosLabs & @Pauljlei input is valuable on this.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: USDT\n\nContract Address: 0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7\n\nRisk Parameter\tValue\nIsolation Mode\tNO\nEnable Borrow\tYES\nEnable Collateral\tNO\nLoan To Value\tN/A\nLiquidation Threshold\tN/A\nLiquidation Bonus\tN/A\nReserve Factor\t10%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\t0.1\nBorrow Cap\t185M\nSupply Cap\t200M\nDebt Ceiling\tN/A\nBase\t0%\nSlope1\t4%\nUoptimal\t90%\nSlope2\t72%\nAdditional note:\nUSDT has been excluded from collateral assets since DeFi inception due to its centralized nature. After years of functioning as intended and witnessing the growth of USDC in the DeFi ecosystem, it seems that reasons for exclusion have fewer grounds in the current DeFi ecosystem and pragmatic approach would be to onboard it in a conservative way and make risk parameters evolve based on market data.\nWhile this ARC doesn’t present a proposal to add USDT as collateral, the ACI thinks the community should consider this as something to discuss at a later stage when V3 will have more maturity.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled.  \n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, $279k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Chaos Labs, with this post using the more conservative of the two risk service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.56B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.81B) and ETH ($1.39B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Arbitrum Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Arbitrum. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and $279k during January 2023.\n\n\n\n\nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Arbitrum, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum. The parameters shown below are a combination of Gauntlet’s and Chao’s work and utilise the same interest rate proposed by Llama for wstETH on Arbitrum.\n\n\nGauntlet’s and Chao’s combined but differing risk assessments can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-support-for-wsteth-on-arbitrum-aave-v3/11387/7).\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled| Yes|\n|Supply Cap (in tokens)| 1,200|\n|Borrow Cap (in tokens)| 190|\n|Debt Ceiling| 0|\n|LTV| 70.0%|\n|LT| 79.0%|\n|Liquidation Bonus| 7.2%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee |10%|\n\n\n### ETH eMode Category\n\n\n|Category|Assets Included|Loan to Value|Liquidation Threshold|Liquidation Bonus|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ethereum Correlated|wstETH wETH|90%|93%|2%|\n\n\n### Borrow Rates\n\n\n|Category|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Base|0.25%|\n|Slope1|4.50%|\n|Slope2|80.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00|\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

Create an Ethereum eMode.\nauthor: Llama - Defi_Consulting\ndated: 2023-01-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis ARFC presents the community with the opportunity to add wstETH to the Optimism V3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nAcross the Aave Liquidity Pools, stETH is listed on Aave v2 Ethereum and wstETH is listed on Aave v3 Ethereum. This proposal seeks to list wstETH on the Optimism Liquidity Pool as Collateral with Borrowing enabled.  \n\nThe stETH/wETH rewards-maximising loop on Aave v2 is the main source of borrowing demand for wETH and the wETH reserve generates a material portion of Aave’s revenue, more than $281k in January 2023. By listing wstETH on Optimism users will be able to enter the same recursive strategy creating borrowing demand for wETH and revenue for Aave.\n \nThe risk parameters have been provided by Gauntlet and Llama, with this post using the parameters agreed between the two service providers.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe stETH reserve on Aave v2 is the largest reserve across all Aave deployments with $1.55B in deposits, exceeding USDC ($0.83B) and ETH ($1.42B). This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximising strategy. \n\nDemand for borrowing wETH on Aave v2 Ethereum increased significantly when stETH was listed as collateral. InstaDapp, Index Coop, Galleon DAO and others have all built products on top of Aave v2 that utilise the rewards-maximising stETH/ETH strategy. By adding wstETH to the Optimism Liquidity Pool, Aave moves closer towards enabling developers to deploy similar products on Optimism. This is expected to create borrowing demand for wETH and boost Aave’s revenue.\n\nThe charts below show the effect of stETH has had on the Aave v2 Ethereum liquidity pool. stETH drives most of the wETH borrowing demand and resulting wETH fee-revenue. The wETH reserve generated approximately $217k in revenue during December and has already generated $281k by late January.\n \n![Screenshot 2023-01-29 at 19.09.51.png](ipfs://bafkreifbt44i7me57hhozvj664bdjcfjotmg4zi5qzjficp4k2boshqt6y)\n    \nListing of stETH by Aave has enabled Aave to offer the best return on wETH, in wETH terms, across major lending markets, continually outperforming Compound. By listing wstETH on Optimism, the Aave community is helping create an environment capable of replicating the success of the Aave v2 Ethereum Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis section presents the risk parameters and interest rates parameters as discussed on the governance forum.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2022-12-17\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1]. As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode.\n\nThis proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens.\n\nUtilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 72.5%. At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAO’s revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost.\n\nIncreasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300%. Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility.\n\nThe breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative.\n\nThe capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3].\n\nBased upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65%. It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65%. The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZloZ51jG8cSo9pK37apk9xqwSnyM2T6WwKWEaimSNA8sVpcxxsRrQBYPf9F6DAFMzXPdlhRWwNePF_5kZrTEoZu8-rfk3CmDtTivdrrwTTQGrAe-ZoZ1to1PlsAaFfbkmQLeRdOAy0qukls3wJAXFgKgCA6TUd6jP2w6mbO4WWKOguI0RjWEQ7BkIg \"Chart\")\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the wMATIC Reserve.\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n|---|---|---|\n|Uoptimal|45%|75%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|6.1%|\n|Slope2|300%|100%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|20%|\n|Supply Cap|32.88M|47M|\n|Borrow Cap|9.23M|39.95M|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx\n[3] https://lido.fi/\n[4] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [4].",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARC] ETH Interest Rate Curve Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon \nDated: 2022-11-05\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend ETH interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 (when deployed) Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWith Aave v3 about to be deployed on Ethereum and a wstETH and ETH eMode likely, the ETH Interest Rate should be adjusted such that the looped recursive strategy breaks even within Slope 1 where the Interest Rate changes are less volatile.\n\nThe new interest rate curve has an Interest Rate of 5.75% at the Uoptimal point, which is 25 bps more than stETH yield at the time of writing. This proposal will lead to improved capital efficiency of the ETH Reserve and generate more revenue for the DAO when compared to just replicating the v2 Interest Rate curve on v3 with the introduction of an ETH eMode Category.\n\nFor the existing v2 market, @llamaxyz suggests adopting the same Interest Rate parameters as being proposed on v3. This will enable the ETH yields across the markets to somewhat equalize leading to higher utilization of the ETH Reserve and more revenue for the DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nBy changing the Interest Rate at the Uopotimal point from 3% to 5.75%, when an eMode for ETH and wstETH is created on Aave v3 the recursive strategy will break even prior to reaching the Uoptimal utilization within the Reserve. This is a desirable feature as the volatility of the Interest Rate on Slope 1 is less than Slope 2. By setting the Slope 1 parameter at 5.75%, 25 bps greater than the current annual wstETH yield, utilization in the Reserve is not expected to reach the Uoptimal level for any prolonged period of time. By reducing the Slope 2 parameter, from 100 to 80, the gradient of the second part of the yield curve increases due to an increase in Uoptimal from 70% to 80%. This is subtle and can be seen in the chart below. The Base Rate for the existing Interest Rate and proposed Interest Rate is unchanged at 0%.\n\nWith the new Interest Rate curve recommended for the v3 deployment, it is reasonable to expect the yield across the v2 and v3 deployment to be arbitraged. If the yield on the v3 deployment converges to the wstETH rate, then this will shift the v2 Reserve utilization beyond the Uoptimal level set at 3%. Because of this, it is recommended to also change the v2 Interest Rate to match the v3 deployment Interest Rate. This way both v2 and v3 Reserves will experience utilization along the Slope 1 portion of the Interest Rate curve whilst also benefiting from improved capital efficiency.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y8ecsyo-6itRFl1OYcFSwfkFvouFWxFad8CC-bjso4Q0D2ya_bSLCosOoh1Z2e8VhSIR8mqSH5srOrah6zPXGRPZs_vcukByDXmknVZOndIeYWe_uX-AaicOPPJB-WviEbyRY1O5ylKgwW-uQxyqyJQ6MtBt3ltJ50wzx4tBmUu3BCq5X2ABiilAsqjz4A \"Chart\")\n\nThis proposal increases the Reserve Factor from 10% to 15%, directing 15% of the interest paid to Aave DAO. When combined with the Interest Rate changes, the v2 deployment will generate an estimated $13.1k per day, up from around $5.5k per day. Prior to this proposal, due the implementation of AIP-68, the Aave DAO is earning less revenue from the ETH Reserve post merge despite utilization within the Reserve increasing significantly over that time, [2].\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the ETH Reserve on Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 when deployed.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|70|80|\n|Base|0|0|\n|Slope1|3.0|5.75|\n|Slope2|100|80|\n|Reserve Factor|10|15|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&marketName=proto_mainnet\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571\n[3] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [3].",
