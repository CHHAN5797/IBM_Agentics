        "body": "- --\n**Title:** [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 deployment on BNB Chain.\n\n**Author:** @marczeller - Aave-Chan Initiative\n\n**Date:** 2023-03-22\n- --\n\n## **Simple Summary**\n\nThis Temperature Check seeks community input on the possibility of deploying Aave V3 on the BNB Chain to expand Aave's presence and tap into BNB Chain's growing DeFi ecosystem and user base.\n\n## **Background**\n\nBNB Chain is a thriving blockchain with a strong DeFi ecosystem and a large user base. With a TVL of approximately $5 billion, BNB Chain is the third-largest chain by TVL. The chain has a diverse array of DeFi offerings, including prominent projects like PancakeSwap, Venus, and several others. Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain has the potential to benefit both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and the potential for additional revenue. BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. Suggested risk parameters for each asset are provided in the table below. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\n| Risk Parameter | BNB | WBTC | BETH | WETH | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 65% | 70% | 60% | 80% | 82.5% | 70% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 75% | 70% | 82.5% | 85% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10% | 10% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 8.5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 15% | 15% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | N/A | 80.000 | 20,000,000 | 20.000.000 |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 | 5,000 | 20,000 | 100,000 | 50,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 75% | 45% | 45% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 6.1% | 7% | 7% | 4.8% | 4% | 4% |\n| Slope2 | 100% | 300% | 300% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~75$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nTemperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain.\n\nARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\nAIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",

Era empowers users with more security and embeds into the familiar infrastructure and ecosystem of EVM.\n\nzkSync Era has launched with a diverse array of DeFi offerings, listed in its ecosystem documents – and others on the way. Deploying Aave V3 on zkSync Era could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and zkSync communities.\n\nEra provides key EVM features, such as smart contract composability - leading to easier deployment of Aave V3 and requiring minimal development work.\n\n## Motivation\nThe Aave community has previously voted to deploy the Aave V3 codebase on zkSync’s v2 Testnet, approved by this off-chain vote. With the release of Era Mainnet, it is possible to re-invest the work of developers, empowering Aave as a hub for mainnet activity and liquidity.\n\nzkSync has the potential to benefit the Aave ecosystem by introducing new users into DeFi, and cementing Aave as the premier borrowing platform within this growing zk ecosystem. zkSync would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying and growing the DeFi options available to its users.\n\nContributing teams like the ACI have described this benefit well before: “EVM-equivalence allows deployment with little development work needed to adapt Aave to [a] new network.”\n\nAdditionally, ecosystem developers note “zkSync will further Aave’s expansion cross-chain, reinforcing Aave’s place as the top liquidity market.”\n\n## Specification\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the zkSync Era Mainnet with a limited deployment of initial assets: USDC and ETH.\n\nSuggested risk parameters for these assets are provided in the table below.\n\nFlipside Crypto invites risk service providers ( such as @Pauljlei & @ChaosLabs) to provide feedback on these assets - as teams wait to confirm native or non-native versions of their token.\n\nWe hope this list grows as the network matures with more users and integrations:\n\n|Risk Parameter|WETH|USDC|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|NO|NO|\n|Enable Borrow|NO|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|YES|\n|Stable borrowing|N/A|NO|\n|Emode Category|N/A|N/A|\n|Loan To Value|80%|82.5%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|82.5%|85%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|5%|5%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|10%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|N/A|10,000,000|\n|Supply Cap|25,000|25,000,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|N/A|N/A|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|4%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|90%|\n\n## Disclaimer\nFlipside Crypto is not compensated in any form by zkSync or Matter Labs for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**ARFC**: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis, and finalization of the proposal.\n\n**AIP**: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

By matching the Aave V2 parameters, we aim to encourage migration and ensure a smoother transition for users. This proposal does not suggest any changes to Aave V3 caps or interest rate strategies.\n\n### **Proposed Aave V3 Parameter Changes**\nTo make Aave V3 more attractive for migration and to match Aave V2 parameters, we propose the following changes:\n\n1. Loan-to-Value (LTV): Increase the LTV from 60% to 66%.\n2. Liquidation Threshold (LT): Increase the LT from 70% to 73%.\n3. Liquidation Penalty (LP): Maintain the current LP of 7.5%, as it is already in alignment with Aave V2.\n\nNo changes to Aave V3 caps or interest rate strategies are proposed in this ARFC.\n\n### **Recap Table**\n| Parameter                | Current Aave V3 | Current Aave V2 | Proposed Aave V3 |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV)      | 60%             | 66%             | 66%              |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT)| 70%             | 73%             | 73%              |\n| Liquidation Penalty (LP)  | 7.5%            | 7.5%            | 7.5%             |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal.\nThis ARFC has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~26k AAVE or related assets for a value of approx $2M.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n1. Gather feedback and input from the Aave community and risk service providers on the proposed risk parameters and deployment details.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\n3. If consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n4. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to update the risk parameters on the Aave V3 Ethereum market.\n\n## **Copyright**\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
