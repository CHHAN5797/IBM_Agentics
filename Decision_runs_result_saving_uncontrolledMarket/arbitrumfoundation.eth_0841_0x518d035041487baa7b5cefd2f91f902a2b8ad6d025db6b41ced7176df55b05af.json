    "ai_final_conclusion": "Option 'Approve funding' selected with stance to keep 'Change'.",
    "ai_final_reason": "- Timeline voting data strongly supports approval with early and consistent lead for funding.\n- Forum sentiment is mixed but the key knowledgeable community members and delegates favor approval, indicating alignment with the recommendation.\n- Similar past proposals with related incentive structures showed successful TVL growth and positive liquidity outcomes, reinforcing confidence in this approach.\n- Market impacts are slightly negative on price but positive on TVL, and do not contradict the timeline or forum sentiment analysis.\n- Despite some concerns about bonding and liquidity lock mechanisms, the proposal's strategy to attract sticky, long-term liquidity and prudent risk management justifies supporting the funding.\n- The recommendation mirrors aggregated community sentiment, though some dissent exists; overall, the choice maximizes the long-term health and growth of the protocol.",
