        "body": "FranklinDAO (Prev. Penn Blockchain) is creating this proposal in partnership with Matter Labs to Deploy Aave V3 on zkSync 2.0 Testnet \n\nProposal link: https://governance.aave.com/t/deploy-aave-v3-on-zksync-v2-0-testnet/10340 \n\n**Summary**\n\nTo support Aave’s multichain mission and expand cross-chain experiences, we propose the deployment of Aave V3 to zkSync 2.0 on behalf of the community.\n\nThe zkSync team will submit a snapshot to launch Aave V3 on ZkSync V2 testnet, and thereafter another snapshot for mainnet (when the criteria for DEX liquidity and other items are met).\n\nzkSync ecosystem has over 200 projects committed to launching on mainnet, including top DeFi protocols, infrastructure, on/off ramps, etc.\nDeploying on zkSync will onboard new users & increase user activity on Aave by decreasing costs compared to Ethereum without security degradation\nzkSync shares Ethereum’s ethos as a free open-source project with a commitment to personal sovereignty, decentralization and community ownership\n\n**About zkSync**\n\nzkSync 2.0 is a [ZK rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) that supports generalized EVM compatibility for the Ethereum blockchain. The primary benefit of zkSync 2.0 is that developers who have created EVM dApps can port to zkSync 2.0 effortlessly and realize significantly lower gas fees and more transactions per second without compromising on security.\nzkSync 2.0 is a significant leap forward in Layer 2 technologies with long awaited improvements and benefits for Ethereum developers:\nEVM Compatible - supporting generalized EVM smart contracts on a ZK rollup making it easy to deploy existing dApps\nToolChain Compatible - able to port smart contracts with existing tools\nEthos Compatible - aligned with the ethos of decentralization and open-source\nCertainty - using zero knowledge proofs offering certainty of security not probability\nFuture Proof - ecosystem partners that adopt zkSync 2.0 now will enjoy all future improvements without the need to change their code\nThere is broad consensus that ZK rollups are the endgame for scaling Ethereum. zkSync’s EVM compatibility, ease of use, and composability will accelerate developer and retail adoption. Top researchers including Vitalik Buterin recognize ZK rollups as the long term scaling solution.\n\n**References**\n\n- Matter Labs Github: [Matter Labs · GitHub](https://github.com/matter-labs)\n- zkSync Homepage: https://zksync.io/\n- zkSync 2.0 Testnet Docs: [zkSync Documentation | zkSync: secure, scalable crypto payments](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/)\n- Blog Posts: https://blog.matter-labs.io/ \n- zkSync Mainnet Alpha Registration: [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdXAoQiHLu16ykEoOb762uvC1bAhdzOG-YDk6ju0YwPWf3Fw/viewform)\n\n\n**Technicalities**\n\n- Solidity/Vyper support; recommended to use ^0.8.0 and Vyper ^0.3.3 [details](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/dev/developer-guides/contracts/contracts.html#solidity-vyper-support) \n- RPC is public: We fully support the Ethereum JSON API, with some additions for L2-level features. More information [here](https://v2-docs.zksync.io/api/api.html#zksync-specific-json-rpc-methods)\n- The Graph is currently indexing zkSync v1 and v2\n- Covalent available immediately after mainnet\n- Working on all other plugins (ape, founders, remix, truffle, tenderly)\n- Chainlink finalising, deploying shortly after mainnet\n- Audits in progress with multiple tier 1 auditors and [bug bounty program](https://docs.zksync.io/dev/security/bug-bounty/)\n\n\n**Timeline**\n\nzkSync has been on testnet since February 2022 and has launched mainnet baby alpha as of October 28th. A timely assessment of the deployment of Aave v3 code to zkSync is important: our team has already tested the smart contract library (mostly key ones) it was compiling and looked like it was working fine.\n\n**Proposal Stages:**\n\nThe zkSync team will first submit a snapshot for testnet deployment, following the community guidelines.\nThen when the time comes, another snapshot for mainnet (when the criteria for DEX liquidity and other items are met)\n\n**Authors:**\n\nzkSync team",

        "body": "Summary\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.\n\nProposal\nBorn out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top notch scalability; built-in on-chain reputation through the Matrix Reputation Power System, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.\n\nThe Metis Layer 2 utilizes an upgraded Optimistic Rollup architecture, allowing for high throughput while maintaining Ethereum’s underlying security. As of right now, Metis is a Stage 0 Rollup, according to Vitalik’s proposed categorization framework. Metis Andromeda is a, first of its kind, Smart L2. The concept of the Smart L2 explores the design space in between Rollups and Plasma architectures, combining rollup’s security with plasma’s scalability. Learn more about the Metis Smart L2. Our L2 is not where our vision ends, per se; our L2 is a means to the end of building an open collaboration framework to host the Web3 economy. This is the foundational base layer that will allow further developments and rollout of the next 2 verticals.\n\nOur second vertical is the Matrix Reputation Power System, a web3 identity system providing a framework to mint and use non-transferable NFTs and toolkits for on-chain reputation: portable and composable reputation earned through on-chain achievements and history. As we all know, in traditional settings and Web2, our data is not ours; Matrix changes this. Soulbound tokens will also allow and enable no-coin governance, establishing provenance, decentralized key management, souldrops, and countless Web2 functionalities that weren’t previously available for Web3. These features will help the ecosystem realize and embody its goals of decentralization, secure its long term health, and make it the perfect setting for Web2 companies looking to transition to Web3 without facing a huge UI change.\n\nThird, our Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework, for seamless onboarding of Web2 onto Web3. DAOs have been crucial for our space, but they lack a clear structure and the right tools to make them suitable for Web2 organizations. DACs, on the other hand, will allow Web2 organizations to tailor these to their preference. By combining DACs and our Polis Middleware, Web2 organizations will have access to a repertoire of smart contract templates, allowing them to deploy without the need of code: seamless, tailored Web2 experiences.\n\nWhen combining all these components, we will allow dApps, Web2 apps and organizations, and/or TradFi to enjoy a seamless onboarding experience and manage their day to day operations in a decentralized and immutable way, while taking advantage of the functionalities provided by on-chain reputation, and the scalability provided by the base Layer 2. The perfect suite for dApps, web2 platforms, or any builder.\n\nCommitted to support our ecosystem builders and see them succeed, MetisDAO Foundation can support projects in 3 main ways:\n-Builder Mining Rewards (Secured)\n-Ecosystem Grants (Application/Approval based)\n-Genesi DAC Investments (Application/Approval based)\n\n*The Builder Mining Reward (BMR) program distributes 4000 METIS tokens each month based on how many txs out of the monthly total each protocol is responsible for (eg. if a protocol is responsible for 10% of the network txs, the protocol would receive 400 METIS that month as part of our sustainability grants / retroactive funding practices).\n\nAs we build the path towards a Web3 economy, it is crucial to establish strong and long-lasting Decentralized Finance foundations. A trusted and established money market such as Aave is a key foundational piece to building up strong capital markets to support the Web3 economy we are building towards. We believe that with Metis-Aave integration, these foundations can be built in a decentralized and scalable way, secured by Ethereum, and welcoming for Web2. Through this integration, AAVE can also generate an extra revenue stream while ramping up its expansion to up and coming Ethereum Layer 2s. \n\nMetis envisions and builds towards a rollup-centric future in Ethereum, and seeks to invite Aave to be part of this mission and enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a surging DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aave’s multichain expansion. There are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from, including Builder Mining Rewards, EVM Equivalence, our Smart L2 architecture, and a healthy mix of native and multichain protocols like LayerZero, Hummus, MaiFinance, Hermes, and much more.\n\nMetis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity, while securing the Andromeda and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network.\n\nMetis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.",

        "body": "Summary\n\nProposal for the deployment of Aave V3 on Metis Andromeda Mainnet.\nProposal\nFounded in 2019, Metis launched its Layer 2 mainnet on November 19, 2021. We are building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: Layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution with fast and cheap transactions; no-code integration via a middleware layer powered by smart contract templates; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) infrastructure enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain, with all the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.\nA mere eight weeks after launching Andromeda mainnet, Metis TVL surpassed the majority of its competitors, surging to the #3 spot as measured by L2Beat and reaching $500M+ TVL. As the fastest growing L2, Metis has taken the blockchain world by storm with its Optimistic Rollup technology, EVM-Equivalence, and incredible mutually-incentivized ecosystem. With a robust and secure infrastructure, a self-deployed Graph node, multiple oracle providers, on-chain explorers, and a dedicated integrations team ready to assist throughout every step of the porting process, Metis is ready for Aave integration.\nMetis envisions and supports a multichain future and seeks to invite Aave to expand its own mission of creating a multichain future, by having Aave enable the Aave V3 front-end for Metis markets. Our robust and enterprise-grade network has a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, and while there are borrowing/lending capabilities currently available, having a Flagship protocol like Aave would be incredibly valuable to our ecosystem, while fulfilling Aave’s multichain expansion. As well, there are many benefits Aave users and the DAO at large would benefit from.\nMetis’ commitment to a decentralized future is built into its very structure, including the ethos of creating a sustainable and mutually beneficial ecosystem where its partners are set up to thrive. This is best exemplified by Metis’ Builder Mining Program. This program allows all DApps deployed on Andromeda to directly participate in the revenue Metis generates. For example: if Aave deployed on Andromeda, 30% of the fees accrued from every single transaction occurring through Aave would be kicked back directly back to Aave, in perpetuity.\nThe mission at Metis is to provide the infrastructure and incentive system to make deployment on our network a no-brainer. This additional revenue will be going to the Aave DAO’s treasury and as such, will be able to be utilized as seen fit by the Aave community at large.\nMetis also has some of the fastest transactions in blockchain, often executing faster than your web browser can process them, and always executing faster than MetaMask can record them. Transactions on our Layer 2 network currently cost about $2-$3, considerably less than the gas fees on Layer 1 Ethereum. Metis will launch its own storage layer by the end of Q1 2022, which will enable cheap, secure storage of NFTs and other large blocks of data, while doubling as an additional scalability layer; as a result, transaction fees will drop to just cents by the end of Q1 2022.\nThe traction earned by our popular DeFi protocols are great case studies to the adoption and eagerness of the Metis community to engage with our DeFi ecosystem. Netswap, the first ever native Layer 2 DEX, surpassed $1B in trading volume in its first month of operation. Likewise, popular yield optimization protocols Beefy Finance and Pickle Finance have achieved great success since integrating and launching their protocols on Andromeda.\nMetis is open and willing to work with Aave to determine the optimal strategy for liquidity incentivization, marketing and awareness campaigns, and additional benefits to bring to its users. We are considering the options of qualifying airdrops for interaction with the protocol on Andromeda and building Reputation Power (allowing for future whitelisting opportunities) for Aave holders voting on this proposal. We will also offer Aave the opportunity to set up a Verifier node for the Metis Layer 2 network, providing a steady stream of income to the Aave DAO in perpetuity and aligning incentives for the future decentralization and wellbeing of the Metis network.\nMetis is ready to onboard Aave to its ecosystem and looks forward to the opportunity to build a long-term, sustainable, and mutually-beneficial relationship.\n\nLinks:\nWebsite: https://metis.io \nMedium: https://metisdao.medium.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MetisDAO\nTelegram: https://t.me/MetisDAO\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/RqfEJZXnxd\nGithub: https://github.com/MetisProtocol\nDocumentation: https://docs.metis.io\nGovernance Post: https://governance.aave.com/t/launch-aave-v3-on-metis/7056\n\n",

        "body": "Boba Network is proposing to deploy Aave v3 on the Boba Network L2 to expand lending to a growing community of users and provide incentives to bootstrap the launch of Aave to a new ecosystem.\n\nParagraph Summary\n\nOur goal is to accelerate Aave's expansion in the multi-chain world. Boba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts.\n\nBoba Network invites the Aave community to support this launch by participating in the Aave contracts deployment, enabling the Aave v3\nfront-end for Boba markets, and adding Boba Network in its recently announced cross-chain governance module roadmap.\n\nIntroducing Boba's WAGMI incentive program for builders and developers, in collaboration with UMAprotocol, we will be distributing WAGMI options on $BOBA tokens to bootstrap initial usage of Aave on Boba Network.\n\nWAGMI options are KPI (key performance indicators) options based on metrics relating to Boba Network, such as monthly active wallets or project specific TVL. Traditional liquidity mining programs are zero-sum: users come to collect high rewards and are incentivized to keep those rewards. WAGMI farming turns this model on its head by being positive sum: users are incentivized to evangelize and encourage behaviors that grow Boba.\n\nIn addition to token incentives, we will be investing heavily in co-marketing and educating users through tutorials, videos, and community-led support.\n\nOur overall goal is to use Boba’s $100 million ecosystem fund for growing a deep base of 1,000 dapps and 1mm+ daily transactions.\n\nMotivation\n\nAave is already planning to go multi-chain and we want to help bring it to the Boba ecosystem, which is growing with the launch of Oolongswap, FRAX, Synapse, Dodo and many other DeFi projects. Aave will be the first major lending protocol on Boba and will add net new users from Boba’s 300,000+ community members. After enabling basic DeFi primitives like AMMs and NFT marketplaces, our community is eagerly awaiting lending markets on Boba.\n\nSpecifications\n\nBoba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of smart contracts. Boba offers fast exits backed by community-driven liquidity pools, shrinking the Optimistic Rollup exit period from seven days to only a few minutes, while giving LPs incentivized yield farming opportunities.\n\nBoba’s extensible smart contracts will enable developers across the Ethereum ecosystem to build dApps that invoke code executed on web-scale infrastructure such as AWS Lambda, making it possible to use algorithms that are either too expensive or impossible to execute on-chain.\n\nBoba Network aspires to be the People’s L2 that puts users and developers first. The goal is to build a pragmatic L2 that is the first step towards opening Ethereum to the next Billion users. Boba is an L2 Ethereum scaling & augmenting solution built by the Enya team as core contributors to the OMG Foundation.\n\nBoba has grown to ~$350mm in TVL on mainnet since launch and it is fully EVM and Ethereum tooling compatible. \n\nFor more details, please read our documentation.\n\nAudience data\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bobanetwork (355K)\nTelegram:https://t.me/bobanetwork (10K)\nDiscord: https://boba.eco/discord (7K)\n\nReferences\nHomepage: https://www.boba.network\nDocumentation: https://docs.boba.network\nSource code: https://github.com/omgnetwork/optimism-v2\nForum: https://https://forum.boba.network\nCommunities: https://twitter.com/bobanetwork\n\nAuthor: 0xmax (@bobachad)",

        "body": "Discussion: \n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-deployment-to-bittorrent-chain-bttc/6813 \n\nSummary\n\nThe BitTorrent DAO Community asks for signaling from the Aave community to accept a deployment of the Aave Protocol into BitTorrent Chain (known as BTTC), which can expand lending to the BitTorrent community and, with the provision of incentives, bootstrap the launch of Aave on a new ecosystem.\n\nProposer\n\nBitTorrent Chain is an open-source, EVM-compatible blockchain that offers high concurrency, higher submission speed, lower transaction fees, and smoother operations. Since BTTC is fully-compatible with TRON, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain, users are able to transfer mainstream assets among TRON, Ethereum, and BSC in a decentralized manner. Openness and accessibility are core values that we practice through our cross-chain strategy, and we find that aligns well with Aave goals.\n\nWe seek to support Aave in its multichain expansion and invite Aave to enable the Aave v2 front-end for BTTC. We believe that BTTC is ready-made to support Aave: BTTC offers a secure infrastructure (multi-node validation), heterogeneous cross-chain solution, faster transaction confirmation (PoS consensus mechanism with an average block time between 2-3 seconds) , and lower transaction fees (<$0.01 on average).\n\nAs the Layer 2 of TRON, BTTC inherits the advanced technology and resources from TRON, as well as $1.1bn TRON Ecosystem Fund. Since TRON’s MainNet release on May 31, 2018, TRON has risen to become the world’s fastest-growing public chain and the world’s largest network in terms of stablecoin settlement. Currently TRON boasts a staggering $70 billion worth of assets, over 66 million TRON accounts, and more than 39.9 billion TRC20-USDT in circulation on its network.\n\nMoreover, BTTC integrates with Binance Smart Chain, which has one of the strongest deflationary mechanisms and currently has more daily active addresses than the rest of all layer 1s combined. That compatibility makes BTTC a better fit for DeFi applications like Aave.\n\nWe are convinced that BTTC is key to ushering in an era of connecting all chains, helping achieve rapid growth across the DeFi space, especially the Aave community.\n\nRationale\n\nCurrent status of the BitTorrent Chain\n\nBitTorrent Chain’s vision is to provide a high-performance, highly scalable, low-cost solution for blockchain platforms that delivers a superior user experience for decentralized applications without sacrificing decentralization while leveraging the existing developer ecosystem.\n\nBTTC is scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of participants due to the performance of consensus. As the first heterogeneous cross-chain interoperability protocol in the industry, users can transfer assets within TRON, Ethereum, BSC without any limits. The PoS consensus network can deal with high throughput and provides instant finality in 2-3 seconds, making the network an incredible homecourt for DeFi and other EVM applications.\n\nWhy is it good for the Aave ecosystem?\n\nBTTC is well-suited for building DeFi applications due to scalability, high throughput, economic, and instant finality. The BitTorrent DAO Community has allocated up to $1bn for users of the Aave protocol. This program will bring new users to the platform, and reach more users from the established TRON community. Having the Aave community embrace deployment on BTTC will allow more users to access Aave’s offerings across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThere is great potential for synergy between BTTC and Aave. As a close partner of TRON, BTTC will be able to contribute more than $1bn on Aave, and there are already more than $800mn assets of BTTC community on the Aave. The TRON DeFi ecosystem is thriving: Total Value Locked across TRON DeFi protocols is $5.39bn and growing. Many well-known protocols such as JustLend, Sunswap, amongst others, have deployed on TRON. On BTTC, Aave would find many users eager to participate in lending markets and add value to the Aave network.\n\nBesides, as BTTC integrates more mainstream public chains like BSC, it will ease down the process of interacting between users and Aave, and that will definitely catapult the Aave ecosystem to the next level.\n\nWhy is signaling necessary?\n\nConsistent with the ethos of the Aave ecosystem, we believe that all deployments of the Aave protocol should be voted on–and accepted by – Aave governance prior to deployment. Deploying the Aave protocol on BTTC will support growth and synergies between the communities, ultimately leading to a stronger DeFi ecosystem.\n\nReference: \nHomepage: https://bt.io/\nGithub: https://github.com/bttcprotocol\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BitTorrent\nMedium: https://medium.com/@BitTorrent\nTelegram: https://t.me/BitTorrentChain\n\n\n",
