We are supportive in their multi-faceted execution strategy and justified grant ask. We support this application.\n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nPancakeSwap’s application was solid and scored well across a lot of criteria. They have a great reputation and a long history of development and growth. They bring some interesting and novel product offerings to Arbitrum under one UI making it easy for users to access, their upcoming integrations with Arbitrum-native applications are also a plus.\nThey have a strong user base with a lot of TVL across other chains which is valuable for Arbitrum. Their KPIs, milestones, and goals are clear and sufficiently justified.\nWhile their growth has not been explosive, there has been a steady upward trend since their deployment on Arbitrum. We would’ve liked to see more effort towards retaining users and LPs after the incentives end + a bit more innovation than pure liquidity mining.\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR PancakeSwap's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal and scored highly on rubric (execution strategy, metrics, etc.) + potential to drive adoption from other chains (where they have more a presence vs. Arbitrum). Milestones are clear and aligned with LTIPP goals to grow volume, usage, and TVL, and, if successful, will be a net positive for the Arbiturm ecosystem. On incentivizing stickiness after LTIPP, keen to observe how Prediction and Stryke contributes to achievement of of LTIPP goals thereafter.\"",

The tokenization and capitalization of volatility is a novel offering enabled by DeFi and smart contract capabilities.\n\nHowever, I do wonder about the stickiness of the users they are able to attract. Much like other DeFi exotic assets and platforms Voltz Finance for example), the depth of reach for exotic DeFi assets is still outside the real of even mainstream onchain adoption. Some more background on the growth AND maturity of their current mainnet TVL has developed so the Peapods team could give more insight into potential future prospects would be helpful in their future grant endavors\n\n\n*Karel feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Peapods Finance's proposal.\n\nStrong proposal and innovative protool. Highly composable and detailed execution plan and grant justification. Since launching, has seen decent adoption on Arbitrum and continued growth on L1. Only concern is regarding the voting mechanism re: the \"\"Top 5 Voted Pods\"\" initiative but given size, not enough to disqualify.\"\t\t\n\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nPeapods Finance is a unique protocol with some interesting mechanisms. Overall, they scored well across the rubric due to their detailed execution plan, but lost a few points for the size of their ask and weak milestones. While their non-Arbitrum TVL is a little low, given the novelty of the protocol we believe this a protocol that can benefit the wider ARB ecosystem and may uniquely benefit from incentives. We will be supporting this application.",

They have justified their grant request with a detailed execution strategy and solid KPIs. We felt like their application could have provided more detailed milestones and the distribution of the incentives is a concern as they will likely end up in the hands of a few users. However, this is a protocol with history of building on Arbitrum and we believe incentivizing its full public launch will improve Arbitrum’s competitiveness. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback)*\nThis application was good and scored decently across some criteria. Their product is unique and we like that it is built on top of existing protocols. They had some solid justification and calculation of KPIs, milestones, and goals, however, their estimations don’t really justify their grant size given the protocol’s current usage.\n\nThey could’ve also improved on their incentive design allocating some rewards to running trading competitions (which actively drive user engagement).\n\nWhile we are aware the protocol is in a private beta, looking at their Dune dashboard there is 1 active daily users indicating very low signs of adoption. We would typically be against supporting an application of this size and grant request, however, their milestone ARB unlocks provide sufficient protection for the DAO.\n\nWe will be supporting this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Pear Protocol's proposal.\n\nWell-written proposal that scored moderately well on the rubric. Innovative product that is composable with other Arbitrum protocols (liquidity agnostic). Despite being in closed beta, they have seen decent usage. Protocol was supposed to launch into full public launch on March 29 but have not seen any updated information on progress here. Proposal could have benefited from bettter distribution mechanisms (ie. capped per user) and more detailed milestones to also drive user metrics on top of TVL. For this proposal going to the DAO.\"",

They have a long history of working on Arbitrum and their products are highly composable and provide value to other Arbitrum protocols.\nTheir goals, milestones, and KPIs are clear with sufficient justification of their grant size.\nOur main concern is that there is a lack of protocol demand and there has not been sufficient growth despite SPA incentives.\nWe would’ve also liked to see some more innovation on the grant distribution side.\nNonetheless, given their current TVL and the fact that rewards will benefit other Arbitrum protocols, we will be supporting this application.\n\n*404 Feedback)*\nSperax did a great job of aligning with the rubric by providing solid milestones, detailed KPIs & execution strategy, and adding a proportional amount of co-contribution. We would have appreciated more details on the grant justification but overall felt the grant ask is fair. We feel their product stack adds additional retention benefits and effectively enables USDs to grow outside the Demeter ecosystem. We will be supporting this proposal.\n\n*Karel feedback)*\n\"Vote FOR Sperax's proposal.\n\nGood proposal that scored well across the rubric. Long tenure and history on Arbitrum, grant size well justified, etc. Like many projects, TVL peaked in 2021/2022 and tapered into 2023, and has not seen much demand in recent times. However, believe second/third-order benefits driven by their composability and their grant execution plan to drive the noted KPIs (TVL and fee income) is sufficiently justified to pass this through to the DAO.\"",

We think their UI/UX focused product will bring in new users and like their incentive design that bases the ARB emissions on TVL growth. A small grant ask that we think is properly justified. \n\n*Wintermute Feedback*\nContrax’s application was well written and provided a good amount of justification and calculation of their grant size and execution strategy. Their adoption thus far has been underwhelming, however, their product looks decent.\n\nWe like their intended execution strategy that focuses on adoption and retention. Ultimately, the incentives also carry a second-order effect by increasing TVL across other Arbitrum protocols.\n\nWhile their grant size is greater than their current TVL, we believe that they have a good enough execution strategy and product that focuses on driving users to Arbitrum.\n\nWe support this application.\n\n*Karel Feedback*\nVote AGAINST Contrax's proposal.\n\nDecent proposal that scored well on rubric. Like the cross-protocol partnerships they have in-place with other Arbitrum protocols. However, minimal product differentiation (beyond web3auth/social sign-on), has shown minimal adoption/demand for the product in contrast to peers, and requested grant size exceeds their TVL. Risk that incentives and APR boost will not lead to organic, long-term/renteitve usage. Believe they should prove out further traction first and resubmit proposal at a later grants window.",
