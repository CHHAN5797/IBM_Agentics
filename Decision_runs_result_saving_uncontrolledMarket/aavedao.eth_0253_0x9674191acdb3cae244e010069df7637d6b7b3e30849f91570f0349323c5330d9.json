        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to increase OP’s liquidation threshold and LTV on Aave V3 Optimism.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOP is currently configured with a liquidation threshold (LT) of 40% and max loan-to-value (LTV) of 30%. These parameters were intentionally [set](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-add-op-as-collateral-to-aave-v3/9087/18) conservatively and in isolation mode, when the asset was first listed to ensure mechanisms were working as intended. In [October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/337/), OP was removed from isolation mode. Following our observations, we believe it prudent to increase the LT and LTV for OP.\n\nOP's average market cap over the past 180 days is $1.78BN, and its daily average volume is $192M.\n\nIt has registered a daily annualized volatility of 98.53%, a 30-day annualized volatility of 92.6%, and its largest single-day price drop was 17.7%.\n\n3.7M of the 7.4M OP supplied is supplied by a single [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x790c9422839fd93a3a4e31e531f96cc87f397c00), who also maintains large positions on Arbitrum and Ethereum. Their last deposit on Optimism was 252K OP on March 12; they repaid $1M USDT on April 6 and currently hold a health score of 2.02.\n\nThe majority of assets borrowed against OP collateral are stablecoins. That puts these positions at risk of liquidation in the event OP’s price moves falls.\nHowever, collateral at risk does not exceed $100K until OP’s price falls to $2.13, a 35% drop from current levels.\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend first aligning OP’s parameters with ARB’s on Arbitrum (50% LTV and 60% LT), an asset with a similar supply distribution and liquidity profile. Following observations at these levels and utilizing our simulation platform, these parameters may be further optimized.\n\n## Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Recommended LTV | Current LT | Recommended LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Optimism | OP | 30.00% | 50.00% | 40.00% | 60.00% |\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to increase the debt ceiling of MKR on V3 Ethereum\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe current debt ceiling for MKR on V3 Ethereum, set at $6M, has reached 100% utilization. \n\nGiven current market conditions and improved liquidity for MKR on Ethereum over the past months, our [Isolation Mode Methodology](https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-isolation-mode-methodology/12440) supports increasing the debt ceiling for MKR to $8.5M. \n\nIt is important to note that the majority of MKR debt positions are concentrated within two accounts, accounting for over 80% of the total debt, as outlined below. While this concentration does not affect the current recommendation, it is something to continue monitoring and will be considered in future MKR recommendations and in cases of significant market changes.\n\n### V2 → V3 Migration\n\nThere are still nearly 3,400 MKR supplied on V2 Ethereum, with nearly $750K in stablecoins borrowed against MKR collateral. The current supply caps and proposed debt ceiling should allow for the migration of these positions.  \n\n### Positions Analysis\n\nThere are currently two major users utilizing MKR as collateral on V3 Ethereum:\n\n1. [0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xa9dee54892713f43c221509cfedbd717d16791a0) -  borrowing $3.11M DAI against his 5,914 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 52% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 1.77.\n2. [0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05](https://community-staging.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x8af700ba841f30e0a3fcb0ee4c4a9d223e1efa05) -  borrowing $1.84M USDC against his 4,077 MKR collateral, accounting for nearly 31% of the debt ceiling. The user's current health score is 2.06.\n\n## Specification:\n\n| Asset | Parameter | Current | Recommended |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MKR | Debt Ceiling | 6,000,000 | 8,500,000 |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

        "body": "# Summary\n\nA proposal to reduce LT and LTV for USDC on Aave V2\n\n# Motivation\n\nFollowing our [ongoing reduction](https://governance.aave.com/t/generalized-lt-ltv-reduction-on-aave/16766) of stablecoin LTs and LTVs on Aave V3 markets, we propose reducing LTs and LTVs on V2 to limit risks posed by the current parameters and align them closer to V3’s parameters. \n\nIt is important to note that in some cases, it is difficult to reduce LTs because of users looping assets with themselves. For example, on Ethereum, there are 58 wallets that are both supplying and borrowing more than 10,000 USDC. This leads us to recommend two different options on which the community can decide: a more aggressive LT reduction, which will result in more liquidations but help reduce LT more quickly and a conservative LT reduction, which will prioritize limiting liquidations. For all options, we recommend decreasing LTV to the target of 75%. \n\n## LT/LTV Reduction\n\nThe overall goal of our stablecoin LT/LTV reduction is the same as on V3, ultimately achieving the following parameters:\n\n| Final LTV | Final LT |\n| --- | --- |\n| 75.00% | 78.00% |\n\n***USDC (Ethereum)***\n\nCurrently, reducing LT would require inducing a significant number of liquidations; a reduction of just 0.50% would create $137K in new liquidations, and a 2% reduction would create $200K in new liquidations. This is largely caused by two users ([1](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb60bda0bab52839a3334bd849d2afb2aa566e631), [2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xf451d30a7ac2e56f52a36825b155b0ac1fb7a867)), both of whom are looping USDC with itself. Thus, our conservative proposal is not adjusting LT, while the aggressive calls for reducing it by 0.50%.\n| Asset | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservative | - | - |\n| Aggressive | 137.3K | 10 |\n\n***USDC.e (Polygon)***\n\nSimilar to USDC on Ethereum, it is difficult to reduce the LT without inducing large liquidations, thus the conservative proposal calls for a reduction to 84.50%.\n\nThe three largest potential liquidations ([1](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xb3095b2861fba8ebcfd199546ce9488c75676850),[2](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0x299b189f47838ee8ebb630c3024bb1cd9f109ee8),[3](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0x818b84cc4c3012cb6b36bfb627fd82438718fc7c)), representing the majority of new value eligible for liquidation, are all wallets that are looping USDC.e with itself.\n\nThe more aggressive approach would reduce LT to 83% and potentially induce $103K worth of liquidations.\n\n| Asset | Value Liquidated ($) | Accounts Liquidated |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Conservative | 10K | 45 |\n| Aggressive | 103K | 235 |\n\n\n***USDC.e (Avalanche)***\n\nOur approach involves reducing USDC.e’s LT to 78%, inducing $10,300 worth of liquidations across 11 new wallets.\n\nAgain, the largest liquidation would be a [user](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave-v2/risk/wallets/0xdb815d4071c3d8b2ebec6c003f30bfbfa6a5d8b8) who is looping USDC.e. This would bring the market in line with our final parameters, and thus there is no need for an aggressive proposal.\n\n# Specification\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec LT (Moderate/Aggressive) | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| Ethereum | USDC | 80.00% | 75.00% | 87.50% | No Change / 87.00% | \n| Polygon | USDC.e | 80.00% | 75.00% | 85.00% | 84.50% / 83.00% | \n| Avalanche | USDC.e | 75.00% | No Change | 80.00% | 78.00% | \n\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2. If consensus is reached, submit an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
