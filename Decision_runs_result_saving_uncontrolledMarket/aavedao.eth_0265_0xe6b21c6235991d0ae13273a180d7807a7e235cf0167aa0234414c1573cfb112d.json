        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Merit - A New Aave-Alignment User Reward System\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - Aave Chan Initiative\nDated: 2024-02-16\n---\n\n## Summary\n\"Merit\" proposes a merkle-tree-based periodic airdrop system, designed to reward Aave-aligned user behaviors and enhance protocol competitiveness, with a defined budget for the initial 90-day period.\n\n## Motivation\nAddressing the competitive DeFi landscape, \"Merit\" seeks to elevate Aave's appeal and efficiency through a rewarding mechanism that prioritizes DAO-beneficial actions, distinguishing Aave from competitors employing artificial incentive methods.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe \"Merit\" system employs a booster-based model to reward specific user actions with points, dictating the weekly StkAAVE and GHO distribution. The system incorporates merit boosters and diluters to adjust user rewards based on their alignment with Aave's objectives. The initiative starts with a budget of 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO, totaling 5M$ for a 90-day duration, focusing on direct Aave protocol engagement and promoting diversified staking strategies.\n\n### Rewarded Actions\n\nActions that align with Aave's strategic objectives will be rewarded:\n\n| Action |\n| --- |\n| Borrow wETH |\n| Borrow GHO |\n\n### Merit boosters\n\nMerit boosters enhance these rewards for specific behaviors:\n\n| Behavior | Multiplier description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Second-degree user of aligned protocol | booster for users coming from aligned protocols that favor Aave over other protocols. |\n| Migrator | Incentive for moving positions to Aave from others protocols |\n| Diversity Supporter | Rewards for using minority LSTs |\n| Aavenger | usage of AAVE as collateral\n| MakerDAO fren | usage of sDAI as collateral\n| OG DAO Participant | Booster for early DAO voters or delegates |\n| Holdooor | Booster for ≥100-day AAVE holders in the past year |\n| Stakoor | Booster for ≥100-day StkAAVE holders in the past year |\n| Staker | Bonus for staking AAVE, StkBPT, StkGHO |\n| Active in Governance | Rewards for voting or delegating to an Aave DAO recognized delegate platform |\n\n### Merit Diluters\n\nMerit Diluters will dilute part or all rewards for certain behaviors:\n\n| Behavior | Dilution Description/Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| User of Non-Aligned Protocol | Severe dilution (up to -100%) |\n\n### Non-aligned protocol list:\n\nWe propose to launch Merit with a single protocol with non-aligned status: **Morpho Aave Optimizers V2 & V3**\n\n### Migration bonus multipliers list:\n\nWe propose to apply the “migratooor” Boosters to users leaving the following protocols to join the Aave ecosystem:\n\n- Morpho V2\n- Morpho V3\n- Morpho Blue\n- Spark\n\n\n### Budget and Scope\n\n- **Bi-Weekly Budget:** Defined by Aave Finance service providers, all data will be published publicly after the Merit program ends.\n- **Total Budget:** **5M$ with 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO for 90 days.**\n- **Scope:** Aave V3 Ethereum.\n\n### Synergies\n\nNumerous protocols reached out during the TEMP CHECK period to co-incentive merit; @karpatkey_TokenLogic via Aave Finance are coordinating these efforts, and their incentives are expected to be on top of the Merit budget.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Refine the proposal details based on community feedback to achieve consensus.\n2. Conduct a snapshot vote for community sentiment.\n3. Following a successful snapshot outcome, escalate to the AIP stage for official voting and implementation.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes \"Merit,\" without external compensation.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

It allows the DAO to restart GHO minting while keeping the peg in check.\n\nGHO is expected to provide 10% of all DAO overall revenue by next week.\n\nHowever, we have to witness less collaborative behavior from some ecosystem actors. In light of this, it seems suboptimal for the Aave DAO to reward uncollaborative protocols & behaviors.\n\nThis is why we suggest stopping any subsidies to the makerDAO ecosystem; the Aave DAO has already paid millions via the AAVE and third-party LM programs and has been repaid by creating competitive forks and activating D3M in a protocol that has stolen millions of revenue from this DAO with no safety track record using a market sensible collateral.\n\nWith this proposal, a single $ in Morpho Blue or Spark will nullify any Merit Airdrop for the user.\nsDAI is considered a makerDAO product, not a Spark product; holding simply sDAI or having it in Aave will not dilute a user.\n\nThis proposal aims to be enabled for Merit Round 2 and all subsequent rounds.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\n### Conservative Option\n\n1. Remove \"MakerDAO fren\" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral\n\n### Aggresive Option\n\n1. Remove \"MakerDAO fren\" Boosters. for the usage of sDAI as collateral\n2. Include Morpho Blue & Spark users in the \"User of Non-Aligned Protocol\" diluter.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If this proposal reaches a consensus on Snapshot, update the Merit reward system accordingly\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Counteract the negative impact of Morpho optimizer on Aave DAO revenue by attracting Ethereum back from Morpho. Merit Round 1 resulted in approximately 165k ETH leaving Morpho and growing Aave's market share. The Morpho product is now imbalanced (limited to a 52k ETH capacity), ensuring it will not offer additional yield on top of Aave, thus achieving its primary goal.\n2. Support the GHO stablecoin peg, fostering supply growth and revenue expansion while maintaining a stablecoin base for the safety module:\n\n   - StkGho supply increased by 45%.\n   - GHO supply grew by 40%.\n   - The GHO borrow rate was increased to 13.8%.\n   - GHO peg remained within target rate 97% of the time.\n   - GHO protocol revenue grew significantly, reaching approximately 6.5m$/year.\n\nMerit Round 2 involved 1367 eligible users, with Staker & Strakoor being the largest booster (over 100 users), indicating a strong user trust in the Aave protocol and willingness to participate in the Safety module for yield and discounted GHO borrowings.\n\nBuilding on these positive outcomes from the first two Merit rounds, the ACI proposes extending the funding of Merit for an additional four periods (three merit rounds per period). This proposal would approve Merit's continuation for the next 12 months.\n\n### Operational aspects:\n\nWe propose Aave Finance incorporates Merit funding within their Treasury Management AIPs if this proposal is approved by a DAO snapshot vote. Our successful collaboration with Angle Protocol and their Merkl product will continue, with the ACI producing user-friendly applications for Merit beneficiaries and providing relevant data to the DAO.\n\nAt present, we do not propose making any changes to boosters or diluters within Merit; however, ad-hoc ARFC snapshot votes can be used by the DAO to modify these aspects of Merit at any time.\n\n### Budget considerations:\n\nThe Aave DAO currently enjoys an excess annual net profit of 80m$. The ACI considers allocating 20m$/year to Merit a worthwhile investment, as it supports Aave protocol market shares and boosts DAO revenue. The expected returns, particularly with GHO, are anticipated to be noteworthy.\n\nShould the DAO decide to discontinue Merit due to unsatisfactory returns or lower profits stemming from market conditions in the future, an ad-hoc ARFC vote can terminate Merit funding and limit budget exposure.\n\n### Learnings from the previous rounds:\n\n1. The wETH \"spray & pray\" approach has been underwhelming for most users due to the large scale of Ethereum borrowing on Aave (2B$). Despite this, wETH Merit was a resounding success in achieving its goals through the behavior of a subset of \"whales\" who recognize the value of Merit based on their substantial positions.\n\nTo address this, this proposal grants flexibility to Aave Finance and the ACI to allocate a part of the wETH Merit budget towards targeting influential users.\n\n2. The Ethereum-centric nature of the GHO Merit program generated some minor backlash due to high Ethereum network transaction fees. With the introduction of cross-chain GHO, we have an opportunity to deploy a \"cross-chain\" merit system in collaboration with L2 safety modules and L2 StkGHO.\n\nTo achieve this goal, this ARFC grants flexibility to Aave Finance and the ACI to allocate a portion of Merit budget to L2 markets following the deployment of cross-chain GHO.\n\n3. Some \"sleepy\" liquidity will likely never claim merit airdrops. To increase program efficiency and resource allocation optimization, this proposal greenlights redistributing unclaimed funds to subsequent merit rounds if a user hasn't claimed during six merit rounds.\nAs an example, unclaimed funds from Round 1 can be allocated to boost the Round 7 budget. \n\n## Specification:\n\nIf this proposal is approved by a snapshot YAE vote, Aave finance will incorporate Merit budget within their monthly Treasury Management AIPs. Funds management will continue to be handled by the  [Merit Safe wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdeadD8aB03075b7FBA81864202a2f59EE25B312b), and Angle's Merkl contracts will still handle distribution.\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

It also involves removing the StkGHO component from the \"Staker\" boost and approving the delayed start of GHO distribution.\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo expand the Merit reward system scope and address concerns about long-term AAVE rewards for StkGHO holders, we propose introducing a new rewarded action: \"Hold StkGHO.\" This change allows for a smooth transition to a safety module that is eventually 100% rewarded in GHO.\n\nWhile there is an overlap between \"Borrow GHO\" and \"Hold StkGHO\" rewarded users, this outcome is considered acceptable. The introduction of a new rewarded action for \"Hold StkGHO\" allows us to address concerns about rewarding users for non-enforcable actions due to the GHO borrow cap reached. \"Holding StkGHO is an incentive to liquidity sink GHO and secondary market demand.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposed Changes:\n\n1. Introduce a new rewarded action, \"Hold StkGHO.\"\n2. Remove the StkGHO component from the \"Staker\" boost to avoid circular logic.\n3. Approve the delayed start of GHO distribution within the Merit program.\n4. Prioritize StkGHO holders' rewarded actions over having GHO debt in the Merit distribution as long as the GHO borrow cap remains below 50M.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If this proposal reaches consensus on Snapshot, update the Merit reward system accordingly\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is made independently by the ACI.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\n**Title:** [ARFC] Introducing \"Frontier\" - Staking as a Service for the Aave DAO\n\n**Author:** Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n**Date:** 2024-01-15\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) introduces \"Frontier,\" a 'Staking as a Service' product for the Aave DAO. This service aims to further decentralize the protocol's staking exposure and actively participate in network security. ACI will operate staking nodes and run validator nodes on behalf of the DAO, enhancing the DAO's passive income and promoting a diversified staking strategy.\n\n## Motivation\n\nTransitioning from simply acquiring Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) like stETH and rETH to actively running validator nodes, \"Frontier\" represents a significant step towards greater involvement in Ethereum's network decentralization and security. \n\nFor this trial experiment, we propose to run 32 Stader minipools of 4 ETH.\n\nThis proactive approach will allow the Aave DAO to host community members in our minipools, providing them with staking exposure through ETHx.\n\n## Specification\n\nTo initiate \"Frontier,\" we propose the creation of a 2/3 multisig controlled by:\n\n- Aci.eth\n- Tokenlogic\n- Karpatkey\n\nThis multisig will be funded with 128 wETH, enabling ACI to set up 32 validator minipools on behalf of the Aave DAO.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n- **Enhanced diversity**: The Aave DAO has been a pioneer in LST diversity, staking as a service can allow the DAO to increase this diversity with new ecosystems and assets that are not necessary onboarded on main pools yet.\n- **Increased alignment**: Most DAO in our ecosystem to generate a passive income on their ETH holdings acquire stETH and call it a day. The Aave DAO was the first to actually push for diversity by adding exposure to rETH.\n\nThis ARFC proposes to take our ETH-alignment a step further by being the first ever DAO actually to run nodes. by operating minipools, the DAO reinforce its synergies with other protocols such as stader, and directly increases these LST alternative market shares by allowing passive investors to acquire ETHx (1 wETH stake by the DAO allows for 3 ETH to be “staked\" via ETHx)\n\nThe Aave DAO always pioneered and led, and we hope to inspire in the ecosystem; this is why this new service is named “Frontier.” (also as a reference to Ethereum's early days).\n\n**Guarantees and Risk Mitigation:**\n\n- **Yield Guarantee:** ACI will ensure a consistent yield, equivalent to the 'regular' ETHx returns, regardless of the actual performance of the nodes. mitigating Aave DAO performance risk.\n\nFrom experience, while Yield is consistent over infinite timeframes and/or deposits, DAOs and humans have the bad habit of not having infinite time and money.\n\n“Solo staking” or “minipool staking” are needed for decentralization, but when placed on the wrong side of variance, it can lead to underwhelming returns. As Frontier grows overtime this effect will be smoothen out, until then, ACI is confident in managing financial risk, even when luck isn't on our side. We are aligned and focused on long-term outcomes.\n\n- **Slashing Protection:** ACI commits to covering any potential losses due to slashing, safeguarding the Aave DAO's wETH funds.\n- **Stader SD Token Provision:** In partnership with Stader, ACI will obtain the necessary SD tokens, enabling the DAO to engage in staking without direct exposure to the SD asset.\n\nThis will remove all need for directional exposure to the SD token for the Aave DAO. The ACI will use related rewards to participate in Stader governance aligned with its “meta-governance” mission.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If Snapshot Stage outcome is YAE, to mitigate governance burden, and reduce the amount of governance AIP, Aave Finance will be requested to include the staking multisig funding in their next treasury management AIP.\n2. Implement \"Frontier\" by setting up the validator minipools\n\n## Disclosure\n\nThe ACI, independently initiates \"Frontier\" without external compensation.\nIf Frontier is approved, The ACI will receive the necessary SD tokens to operate Pools from Stader.\nThe ACI already operates Ethereum validators, Rocketpool, & stader Minipools privately.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
