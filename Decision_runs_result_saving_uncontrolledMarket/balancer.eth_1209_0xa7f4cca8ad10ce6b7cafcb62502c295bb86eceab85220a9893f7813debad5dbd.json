Currently, the Aave Protocol has a TVL of approximately $11.63 Billion.\n>\n> GHO is a decentralized multi-collateral stable coin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol.\n>\n>**pyUSD & Trident**\n> PayPal is a globally recognized leader in the payments and remittance industry. Its entrance to the crypto space with the launch of pyUSD represents a significant step into the Web3 world as the company looks to expand and improve its product offerings.\n>\n> Launched in August 2023, pyUSD is a partnership between PayPal and the Paxos Trust Company, whose previous assets include USDP and BUSD. The code for pyUSD is built on Paxos previous success with the aforementioned USDP token. Paxos is a New York State Department of Financial Services regulated Trust that acts as a qualified custodian of fully bankruptcy remote and segregated funds. Paxos issued coins such as pyUSD are always redeemable 1:1 and its reserves are held in cash and US Treasuries.\n>\n>Trident Digital is an experienced digital asset solutions provider that works with counterparties to achieve a number of goals across the crypto space. Trident Digital aims to scale stable coin adoption both within and outside the crypto market through strong relationships and experience navigating both the crypto and traditional finance markets. Our previous on-chain work includes facilitation of incentives for the [USDP-PSM](https://messari.io/governor/proposal/57b2db7d-7505-4190-9696-ac2c344e46a2).\n>\n> While the pyUSD/GHO pool currently holds no funds Trident Digital is working with partners to provide deep liquidity to the pool in the very near future.\n>\n>## Motivation\n>\n>This proposal aims to add one new veBAL gauge.\n>\n>GHO/pyUSD E-CLP - Range: -80bps to 50bps\n\n>## Specification\n>\n>1. **Governance:** \n>\n>* AAVE, aAAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO. Holders can vote on proposals at both a Snapshot level and through the Aave DAO [on-chain governance portal](https://app.aave.com/governance/). \n>\n>2. **Oracles:**\n>\n>No rate providers are used.\n>\n>* rateProvider0 (for GHO): 0x0 (none)\n>* rateProvider1 (for pyUSD): 0x0 (none)\n>\n>3. **Audits:**\n>\n>*Aave v3*\n>* [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin ](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [Peckshield](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/14-01-2022_PeckShield_AaveV3.pdf)\n>* [SigmaPrime](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_SigmaPrime_AaveV3.pdf)\n>\n>*GHO*\n>* [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/02-06-2023_SigmaPrime.pdf)\n>* [Sigma Prime](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/07-03-2023_SigmaPrime.pdf)\n>* [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/01-03-2023_ABDK.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin-v2](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/10-11-2022_Openzeppelin-v2.pdf)\n>* [OpenZeppelin-v1](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/blob/main/audits/12-08-2022_Openzeppelin-v1.pdf)\n>\n> *pyUSD*\n> * [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/paxosglobal/pyusd-contract/blob/master/audit-reports/Trail_of_Bits_Audit_Report.pdf)\n> * [Historical database of monthly attestations](https://paxos.com/pyusd-transparency/)\n> \n>On the off-chain side Paxos works with [Withum](https://www.withum.com/), a nationally-ranked audit firm, in order to provide timely monthly attestations of reserves backing pyUSD.\n>\n>4. **Centralization vectors:** \n>* Aave Governance is decentralized, and all changes must go through a transparent and well-tested governance process.\n>\n>* Paxos is a centralized entity functioning in a similar way to Circle, the issuer of USDC. There is no governance structure outside of that dictated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\n>\n>* All pyUSD is issued 1:1 against funds held in either cash or US Government Treasuries. All funds backing pyUSD are held bankruptcy remote with New York Banking laws protecting customer funds from being used to satisfy any debt of Paxos.\n>\n>* The E-CLP Pool type, the FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n>\n>5. **Market History:** \n>* [GHO](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)\n>* [pyUSD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/paypal-usd)\n>\n>6. **Value:**\n>* This pool is expected to drive meaningful TVL to Balancer and Aura Finance. The assets within the pool are not yield bearing.

USDC lives natively on the internet, running on many of the world’s most advanced blockchains. Billions of USDC change hands every day1, and every digital dollar of USDC is always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. - [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)\n>\n> **GYD**\n> GYD is an all-weather stablecoin that provides one-stop access to stablecoin risk control. GYD is fully backed by a set of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level to automate diversification and redundancy.\n>\n>These innovations include automated risk diversification rules, optimized minting and redemption design that guides the protocol on how to use reserve assets to maintain stability, and multiple layers of redundancy in price feeds and circuit breakers.\n\n\n>## Motivation\n>\n>This proposal aims to add three veBAL gauges and cancelling one unsed gauges.\n>\n>New Gauges\n>GHO/USDC E-CLP - Range: -70bps to 30bps\n>GHO/USDC E-CLP - Range: -110bps to 30bps\n>GHO/GYD E-CLP - Range: -110bps to 30bps\n>\n>Unused Gauges\n>wETH/GHO - 80/20\n>\n\n>## Specification\n>\n>1. **Governance:** \n>\n>* AAVE, aAAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO.

Currently, the Aave Protocol has a TVL of approximately $10.7 Billion.\n>\n>GHO is a decentralized multi-collateral stable coin that is fully backed, transparent and native to the Aave Protocol.\n>\n>**USDC**\nUSDC is a digital dollar, also known as a stablecoin, that’s available 24/7 and moves at internet speed. USDC lives natively on the internet, running on many of the world’s most advanced blockchains. Billions of USDC change hands every day1, and every digital dollar of USDC is always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. - [Circle](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)\n>\n>**GYD**\n> GYD is an all-weather stablecoin that provides one-stop access to stablecoin risk control. GYD is fully backed by a set of assets with fundamental innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level to automate diversification and redundancy.\n>\n>These innovations include automated risk diversification rules, optimized minting and redemption design that guides the protocol on how to use reserve assets to maintain stability, and multiple layers of redundancy in price feeds and circuit breakers.[-Gyroscope](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-491-enable-3-gyd-stablecoin-gauges-ethereum/5357)\n>\n>**USDT**\n>\n>All Tether tokens (USD₮) are pegged at 1-to-1 with a matching fiat currency and are backed 100% by Tether’s reserves.[- Tether](https://tether.to/en/)\n>\n>**USDe & Ethena**\n>\n>Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money not reliant on traditional banking system infrastructure, alongside a globally accessible dollar denominated savings instrument - the ‘Internet Bond’.\n>\n>Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, provides a stable crypto-native solution for money achieved by delta-hedging staked Ethereum collateral. USDe is fully collateralized and free to compose throughout DeFi.\n>\n>USDe peg stability is ensured through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against protocol-held collateral.\n>\n>## Motivation\n>\n>This proposal aims to add four veBAL gauges:\n>\n>**New Gauges**\n>\n>GHO/USDe Pool - Range: -50bps to 50bps\n>GHO/aArbUSDC Pool - Range: -40bps to 2bps\n>GHO/GYD Pool - Range: -40bps to 2bps\n>GHO/USDC/USDT Pool - Composable Stable Amp 750\n>\n>## Specification\n>\n>1. **Governance:** \n>\n>* AAVE, aAAVE and stkAAVE serve as the governance tokens for the Aave DAO.
