        "body": "# Summary\n\nBuilding on the recent integration of [Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS)](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-generalized-risk-stewards-agrs-activation/19178), this proposal introduces an automated Risk Oracle framework to enhance the efficiency of Supply and Borrow cap updates within the Aave Protocol. The framework is built around two core components: (1) algorithmic, simulation-based assessments continuously conducted to evaluate cap exposure across all markets, and (2) predefined cap utilization thresholds that trigger simulations to determine whether cap adjustments are necessary. Operating under stricter constraints than those currently permitted at the Risk Steward contract level, this system introduces no additional permissions while significantly improving the observability and responsiveness of risk management. The initial deployment is planned for Arbitrum to start, to be expanded to other chains in the future.\n\n# Motivation\n\n### Current Cap Update Process\n\nThe current implementation of the Risk Steward contract allows for the manual, periodic updating of Supply and Borrow caps, generally performed in response to market demand. Such an implementation allows for the risk/reward of respective asset exposure to be quantified and assessed in a much quicker fashion as opposed to the traditional governance mechanisms in place. This creates the ability to perform cap increases every three days by up to a 100% relative change, alongside functionality to react to adverse events or liquidity crunches through cap exposure decreases to any nominal value.\n\nWhile the implementation of the Risk Steward contract allows such risk configurations to be optimally managed in a more efficient manner, this manual integration creates significant operational overhead to maintain the state of relative demand across all Aave markets. This is currently performed through the following process:\n\n1. Manually identify a necessary cap assessment and potential alteration through internal alerting systems.\n2. Run internal supply and borrow cap risk simulations for the asset, determining the optimal increase or decrease with respect to the defined constraints at the Risk Steward level.\n3. Create a forum post outlining the imminent cap change(s) and the associated rationale for such increases through a risk report that references the state of the asset’s Aave market.\n4. Obtain the calldata and create a transaction for the cap change.\n5. Execute the cap change after a final security verification by BGD (2/2 Safe)\n\nThe high volume of updates, combined with the manual triggering of supply and borrow cap simulations, written analyses, and coordination across multiple service providers, often leads to delays in implementing cap increases. These delays can hinder potential growth opportunities for underlying assets that might otherwise contribute significantly. Additionally, the reliance on manual monitoring to address liquidity crunches for specific assets and chains adds further inefficiency. For context, since October 1, 2024, a total of 178 manual cap updates and 49 written analyses have been conducted across all instances.\n\n![image - 2025-02-03T010936.218.png](ipfs://bafkreibuloniitunlqaov72bnkc5oembjewu66dorrgnc26yzprj3hbgiu)\n### **Edge - Risk Oracle**\n\nThe Supply and Borrow Cap Risk Oracle automates the process of generating and applying cap recommendations for Aave, leveraging our underlying simulation engine being utilized today to perform manual cap changes through the Risk Steward. Depending on whether the cap utilization surpasses or falls below specific thresholds, either the cap increase or cap decrease simulation is triggered, in addition to the frequent time-based triggering of simulations for all respective markets. The simulation then determines the optimal new cap value based on a range of risk metrics. Once calculated, the updated cap is automatically published to the contract, where it is directly applied to the market, updating the cap value in real-time.\n\nThe following section provides a more detailed technical overview.\n\n- **Cap Increases**\n    - The risk oracle is triggered when the median cap utilization exceeds the defined utilization threshold for a full day.\n    - The simulation stress-tests larger supply and borrow caps, taking into account the current state of the protocol, user positions, and external factors such as liquidity availability on the chain and the general circulating supply.\n    - **Parameter Adjustments**:\n        - **Supply Cap**: Recommend a new supply cap, if the risk allows.\n        - **Borrow Cap**: Recommend a new borrow cap, constrained by its ratio to the current supply cap. If the current supply cap does not support an increase, a new supply cap will be recommended (if the risk allows) to support the new borrow cap.\n- **Cap Decreases**\n    - Decreasing cap exposure through the risk oracle is triggered with two different components of the model:\n        1. Dynamic decreases resulting from asset liquidity depreciation and/or an unhealthy set of positions within the market. The simulation stress-tests the current supply and borrow caps for all assets on a weekly cadence, taking into account the current state of the protocol, user positions, and external factors such as liquidity availability on the chain and the general circulating supply. If the current nominal cap value is deemed too risky, the simulation will determine the optimal decrease value as a function of the aforementioned components.\n        2. Deterministic decreases as a result of low cap utilization within a respective market when the monthly utilization falls below a specified threshold. To ensure a conservative approach, utilization must stay below these thresholds for at least 90% of the time. In such cases, the cap will be halved, leading to a maximum updated utilization of 50% for Supply Caps and 30% for Borrow Caps. The cap can only be reduced down to a fixed minimum value.\n    - **Parameter Adjustments**:\n        - **Supply Cap**: Recommend a new supply cap, depending on the associated risk defined in (1), and ensuring it can still support the current borrow cap in (2)\n        - **Borrow Cap**: Recommend a new borrow cap.\n- **Update Frequency**:\n    - Adjustments are made when utilization or the general market state requires it, with a minimum of 3 days between updates.\n- **Monitoring and Transparency:**\n    - All adjustments will be transparent and auditable, with data available for community review.\n\n### Risk Oracle Permissions\n\n- The risk steward contract currently enforces the following constraints:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Percent change allowed** | **minimumDelay** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply Cap | +100% (increase) | 3 days |\n| Borrow Cap | +100% (increase) | 3 days |\n\nThe proposed modification to the current flow of cap updates automates the process of leveraging our currently manually utilized risk simulations to increase such caps. As such, in the proposed specification, the associated percent change allowed will be set at a more conservative +30%, with an equivalent minimum delay adhered to at the Risk Oracle level. All supply and borrow cap update events emitted can be observed in our Risk Oracle dashboard [here](https://edgebychaos.com/risk-feeds/aave). As this system will minimize the amount of manual overhead for each cap increase performed, we aim to provide periodic performance reports for the DAO.\n\nThrough the integration on Arbitrum, the following 15 markets fall under the specification:\n\n![image - 2025-02-03T010941.873.png](ipfs://bafkreieiddfslmk2up55jpwgvaxsv4zwnem3pimbv3pggsfxbi3c2jjnni)\n[Chaos Labs Arbitrum Risk Dashboard](https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/markets/Arbitrum-main/listed-assets)\n\n### Growth/Speculative Assets\n\nWhile the Risk Oracle is designed to establish a generalized system for automated cap increases within the proposed constraints, certain speculative, growth-oriented assets—such as ezETH on Arbitrum—cannot be standardized in this manner. These assets inherit external ad-hoc inputs, preferential considerations, and limiting risk configurations at the protocol level. As a result, the Risk Oracle will not be used to recommend cap increases for such assets. Instead, they will continue to be manually assessed using the existing method employed through the Risk Steward contract. Additionally, manual stewards will remain as a fallback mechanism when deemed necessary, ensuring continuity with the current implementation.",

Currently, selling 500 weETH incurs less than 2% price slippage.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082239.816.png](ipfs://bafkreibyphb5tf77ava6uh66nvyjywpge3xm5eqiymiltgo7k5qlaw45sy)\nweETH's liquidity on Base has remained similarly stable following an increase in the 4th quarter of 2024. Currently, selling 650 weETH incurs less than 2% price slippage.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082243.366.png](ipfs://bafkreid4jarfroyybcfct7r5s4eqk5cl5lpzraat4iuzfihxzprverx3hq)\nweETH’s DEX liquidity on Ethereum has remained stable over the last 6 months, with the current sell liquidity under a 1% price impact being of 15,000 weETH.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082246.864.png](ipfs://bafkreicpeji6azwsuwu6pplrqt3z4obkl7jwvh55cij52wr3tglhtiinmq)\n### Peg Stability\n\nBelow, we analyze weETH’s peg stability during the August 5, 2024, market stress event, in which WETH fell 21%. Evaluating weETH’s exchange rate stability is critical for assessing LTV and E-mode parameters, as price deviations between weETH and WETH can lead to delays in liquidation and arbitrage-driven borrowing, impacting risk exposure.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-10 at 3.30.44 PM (1).png](ipfs://bafybeiat3fnejbuqh4qq74vs6fseh3f55jpf5viqmze3u33pznx3zqm54e)\nOn August 5, the weETH/WETH market rate followed a similar trajectory, with a maximum deviation reaching 140 bps. While the recovery speed on both chains was comparable, Ethereum exhibited a slightly faster reversion to the internal exchange rate. On Arbitrum, the market rate took longer to revert compared to Base and Ethereum. However, all three instances demonstrated a successful recovery and quick mean reversion.\n\n### LT & LTV\n\nBased on the above observations, weETH’s liquidity on Base has remained stable after recent improvements, and its ability to maintain a stable peg under stressful market conditions supports an LTV&LT increase. Therefore, we recommend increasing LTV to 75% and LT to 77%. Additionally, we propose establishing a separate weETH/WETH Liquid E-Mode with higher parameters to enhance users' capital efficiency rather than adjusting the parameters within the existing E-Mode.\n\nOn Arbitrum, weETH demonstrates similar stability in liquidity compared to Base but exhibits slightly weaker peg stability than on Base and Ethereum. However, its properties are still sufficient to recommend increasing its collateral parameters to 75% and 77%, aligning them with those on Base.\n\nHowever, given the reduced liquidity present on the Base chain we recommend adjusting the Liquidation Bonus within the weETH/WETH E-Mode to 1.25% to mitigate the price impact caused by large highly correlated positions.\n\n# wstETH\n\nFollowing the introduction to Liquid E-Modes with Aave v3.2, which enables targeted combinations of collateral and debt assets, we propose aligning the wstETH’s more aggressive parameters currently present on the Prime instance across all Aave deployments. Thanks to wstETH’s battle-tested stability, this change will improve capital efficiency while maintaining reduced risk.\n\nTo align the LT and LTV of wstETH to those used within Prime’s E-Mode, we cover the asset's volatility and peg over multiple instances.\n\nOn Base, wstETH’s liquidity against WETH has declined in recent months. However, thanks to the fast bridging speed and quick mean reversion properties, it is still sufficient to support the proposed parameters. \n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082253.225.png](ipfs://bafkreicfztiw2mj7wcz3t53wlcupdgpw5ivssomv7bnzhzrnvytpf2b76y)\nIts liquidity has also fallen slightly on Arbitrum, though it has been more stable in the past two months, with a 1,000 wstETH for WETH swap able to be completed for less than 1% price slippage.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082256.676.png](ipfs://bafkreifn2s3fylqr4tq4rhfrhtv2g6omqzusnnp7eussf5otvs5hh7lv2e)\n### Peg Stability\n\nPrice deviations can cause problems like arbitrage exploitation, where, given the underlying liquidation threshold, users take advantage of price differences between the protocol’s fundamental valuation of an asset and its market price, potentially destabilizing liquidity. This can lead to WETH debt accrual and thus, in tandem with WETH collateral liquidations and withdrawals due to the underwriting of temporary mispriced debt, lead to interest rate and utilization spikes, with LST/LRT-collateralized e-mode LTVs gradually (net) increasing while WETH collateralized stablecoin debt positions risk unperformed liquidations due to such utilization rates.\n\nThese deviations typically arise during periods of market stress. In such scenarios, deviations are driven by complex factors, including investor de-risking from volatile assets, liquidation cascades triggered by non-correlated positions such as stablecoin borrows against WETH, and, in rare cases, slashing events that erode confidence in an asset. The speed of reversion is generally contingent on the market priced implied duration risk associated with such a WETH-correlated asset, which can be dynamic dictated by exit queue considerations, as well as the game-theoretic value given by the fundamental robustness and on-chain liquidity of the asset itself.\n\nFor this reason, to gauge the resilience of wstETH’s peg to ETH across different chains, given by the available liquidity and leverage on the chain, we analyze price behavior during the market drop that occurred on August 5, 2024, during which WETH suffered a 21% daily drop, with the rest of the market following suit and LST/LRT assets showing significant deviations. Despite that, wstETH demonstrated strong reversion characteristics across Base, Arbitrum, and Scroll. This observation indicates a high degree of stability that supports the proposed E-Mode parameters.\n\n- **Ethereum:** On Ethereum, wstETH dropped to a minimum of 1.1531 WETH, representing a 1.85% depeg. The asset quickly returned within 0.5% from its exchange rate, showing a strong mean reversion tendency.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082259.823.png](ipfs://bafkreihnkljagpcy5pe5vwqq5kwcins3hicybvibzn7is5mjhlh3erxdp4)\n- **Base**: On Base, wstETH dropped to a minimum of 1.1490 WETH, representing a 2.1% depeg. Despite this dip, the asset quickly returned to its peg, demonstrating resilience and a tendency toward mean reversion under stress.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082302.791.png](ipfs://bafkreihzzceteodebsmdmaaw7damfktztpwgavkjvfaockw44nsdcijcl4)\n- **Arbitrum**: On Arbitrum, wstETH experienced a smaller depeg of 1.66%, reaching a low of 1.1550 WETH. Although this recovery was slightly slower than on Base, wstETH still demonstrated consistent mean reversion and stability.\n\n![image - 2025-03-23T082305.579.png](ipfs://bafkreid76hrccbxg3bksxhpfoygt5agutoy7wwmahcl6jjwtlcdfzfft6y)\n### LT and LTV\n\nThe combination of robust liquidity, strong peg stability, and the inherent resilience of wstETH ensures that aligning LTV and LT parameters for the wstETH/WETH E-Mode on Arbitrum, Base and Core to the one on Lido instance is both feasible and prudent. This is because the ETH-correlated E-Mode configuration is constrained by the least liquid and least stable assets within the pool, limiting capital efficiency across the board. However, with these updated configurations, we can adopt parameters that better reflect the liquidity and stability of wstETH, allowing for higher capital efficiency in isolated E-Modes.\n\nHence, we recommend setting the LTV at 93.5% and the LT at 95.5%. By enabling a high level of leverage, these parameters are also expected to increase demand for WETH across the chains.\n\n### Collateral and Borrowable\n\nTo prevent same-asset looping, which could undermine future use of liquidity incentives and lead to unintended utilization, we recommend configuring wstETH as collateral and WETH as borrowable in the proposed E-Mode. This structure aligns with the approach detailed in [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-risk-parameter-updates-wsteth-weth-e-mode-parameters-for-lido-market-10-20-24/19542), which advocates for selective collateral and borrowing configurations to maintain market efficiency.\n\n## Specification\n\nBased on the observations and considerations outlined above, we recommend implementing the following liquid E-Mode configuration for the weETH/WETH pair on Base and proposing an LTV adjustment for weETH on both Arbitrum, Base, and Core Instances.\n\n### **weETH/WETH E-Mode (Base)**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | weETH | WETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 93% | - |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95% | - |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.25% | - |\n\n### **weETH LT&LTV**\n\n| **Asset** | **Chain** | **Current LTV** | **Recommended LTV** | **Current LT** | **Recommended LT** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| weETH | Base | 72.5% | 75% | 75% | 77% |\n| weETH | Arbitrum | 72.5% | 75% | 75% | 77% |\n\n### wstETH/ WETH **E-Mode** (Base)\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | wstETH | WETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 93.5% | 93.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95.5% | 95.5% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n### wstETH/ WETH **E-Mode** (Arbitrum)\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | wstETH | WETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 93.5% | 93.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95.5% | 95.5% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n### wstETH/ WETH **E-Mode** (Ethereum Core)\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | wstETH | WETH |\n| Collateral | Yes | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 93.5% | 93.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95.5% | 95.5% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

        "body": "## Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust ten (10) total risk parameters, including Loan-to-Value and Liquidation Threshold, across five (5) Aave V3 assets.\n\n- GNO on Gnosis\n- OP on Optimism\n- ARB on Arbitrum\n- stMATIC on Polygon\n- MaticX on Polygon\n\n## Analysis\n\nIncreasing the liquidation threshold and LTV for assets allows Aave to enhance users’ capital efficiency. However, this must be balanced with proper risk management to ensure that there is a sufficient buffer in the event of large drawdowns and/or liquidations. The analyses below were conducted utilizing our LT simulations, which showed either minimal or no increases in VaR at the recommended LT levels, while also considering user distribution and on-chain liquidity.\n\n### GNO (Gnosis)\n\nGNO is in isolation mode with a debt ceiling of $2M, with $971K borrowed against it, split between USDC and WXDAI. The top suppliers of GNO have strong health scores of over 3, while some do not borrow against GNO.\n\nGiven the user distribution and liquidity, we recommend increasing the LT to 53% and the LTV to 48%.\n\n### OP (Optimism)\n\nUSDC and USDT are the most popular assets borrowed against OP collateral, together with DAI representing 71% of the total debt against OP. These positions are thus at risk of liquidation should OP’s price fall. \n\nHowever, the largest suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores and on-chain liquidity would support their liquidation.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### ARB (Arbitrum)\n\nThere is currently $5.64M borrowed against $28.5M ARB in this market, the majority of which is stablecoins.\n\nCollateral at risk increases smoothly as ARB’s price declines, and we find that on-chain liquidity can support efficient liquidations. \n\nGiven this, we recommend increasing the LTV to 58% and the LT to 63%.\n\n### stMATIC (Polygon)\n\nThere is $6.28M borrowed against $30.09M stMATIC in this market, with $2.4M of that borrowed in E-Mode. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of USDC.e.\n\nThe top suppliers maintain relatively strong health scores, with the largest borrowing just $82K against $12M stMATIC, putting this market at relatively lower risk of large scale liquidations.\n\nGiven these factors, we recommend increasing the LTV to 48% and the LT to 58%.\n\n### MaticX (Polygon)\n\n75% of the value borrowed against MaticX is associated with MATIC-correlated assets in E-Mode, putting these positions at a relatively lower risk of liquidation. Non-E-Mode borrows are primarily of stablecoins, with USCD.e the largest.\n\nThe largest MaticX suppliers are either looping with WMATIC, borrowing a small amount of WETH, or borrowing USDC.e. \n\nGiven on-chain liquidity and user distribution, we recommend increasing the LTV to 50% and the LT to 60%.\n\n## Specification\n\nGiven these observations, we recommend making the following changes:\n\n| Chain | Asset | Current LTV | Rec. LTV | Current LT | Rec. LT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gnosis | GNO | 45% | 48% | 50% | 53% |\n| Optimism | OP | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Arbitrum | ARB | 50% | 58% | 60% | 63% |\n| Polygon | stMATIC | 45% | 48% | 56% | 58% |\n| Polygon | MaticX | 45% | 50% | 58% | 60% |\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe invite a community discussion around the proposed parameter updates and, barring community objection, will follow up with a Snapshot vote in five days.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",

After several months of successful operation, we propose updating the parameters to allow for more responsive risk management while maintaining appropriate safety constraints.\n\nTechnical service providers spend significant time reviewing risk parameter update AIPs, which could be more efficiently handled through the Risk Steward mechanism. With well-defined processes in place and months of successful operation, we can safely expand the scope of parameter adjustments allowed through this system.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following parameter updates are proposed for the Risk Steward:\n\n### Updated Parameters\n\n> LT, LTV and LB decreased to 0.5% 2025-03-12\n\n- **Supply and Borrow Caps:** 100% relative change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Debt Ceiling:** 20% relative change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **LST Cap adapter params:** 5% relative change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Stable price cap:** 0.5% relative change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Base Variable Borrow Rate:** 1% absolute change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Slope 1:** 1% absolute change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Slope 2:** 20% absolute change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Optimal Point (Kink):** 3% absolute change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Loan to Value (LTV):** 0.5% absolute change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Liquidation Threshold:** 0.5% absolute change with 3 days minimum delay\n- **Liquidation Bonus:** 0.5% absolute change with 3 days minimum delay\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nThe proposed parameter updates maintain conservative limits while allowing for more efficient risk management. The minimum delay periods ensure adequate time for review and response to any changes.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe implementation will require updating the RiskSteward smart contract with the new parameter constraints.\n\n## Useful Links\n\nhttps://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nACI did not received payment for the creation of this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "## Overview\n\nThis proposal continues on the proposed steps from [this post](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719) by recommending the removal of sUSD as collateral on Aave V3’s Optimism. Additionally, we recommend reducing the LT and LTV of the Stablecoin E-Mode on Optimism, which sUSD is part of, and setting sUSD LTV to 0.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis recommendation follows the recent proposal to reduce the supply and borrow cap of sUSD to 10m and 1, respectively; that recommendation follows a period of reduced sUSD DEX liquidity, which dropped to a buy-side low of $2M before recovering after the introduction of token incentives.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151805.225.png](ipfs://bafkreihgsfq3rklem3uewkfzhpofau2fc7mkp742shace72sae7aay3d7i)\nDuring this period, shorting activity on sUSD was observed between January 9th and January 15th. Following the implementation of token incentives on January 16th, as detailed in [this announcement](https://x.com/synthetix_io/status/1878944713446924552), these short positions were closed, and new borrowing demand primarily came from users farming the newly introduced incentives.\n\nBelow, we present a table of the current sUSD borrows on Aave and the associated strategy exposure. The distribution of such strategies seems to be quite dispersed, with the recent incentive structure leading to demand to create perpetual positions on Synthetix coupled with liquidity pool growth rather than short positions.\n\n| User | Action | Size | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0xD8b88C185e06eBF8C58B7dc8b7AFf18304CdD888 | Short | 350k | Jan 9 to Jan 15 |\n| 0x49bf093277bf4dde49c48c6aa55a3bda3eedef68 | LP | 150k | 16th |\n| 0x407cff84eeaacda390fe302c99fa5dd32521bc53 | Holding | 400k | 16th |\n| 0xe31deacee1770dfa56f8849724bcb7f8e5f76ef2 | LP | 130k | 16th |\n| 0xf7ca1f0ff0995c84fef530f7c74c69fb80331e81 | Perp | 200k | 16th |\n| 0x9644a6920bd0a1923c2c6c1dddf691b7a42e8a65 | Perp+LP | 750k | 16th |\n| 0xfd81b27d9796a1ba7d7171ea70010c9befb2a62a | Perp | 380k | 17th |\n\n### Peg Dynamics and Mechanism Design\n\nAn analysis of the peg and utilization dynamics revealed that the deviation can be attributed to a combination of multiple factors, including traders profiting from the Synthetix Perpetual platform, the lack of interest rate on sUSD debt in an environment of heightened rates, and the ongoing migration to Synthetix V3 which reduces the demand for sUSD. This created an imbalance as this excess supply was not met with proportional demand, putting downward pressure on the price of sUSD. This conclusion is supported by the increase in sUSD’s market cap, which closely followed the downward price deviation and the growth in interest rates.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151807.732.png](ipfs://bafybeicynmyw2iywjymc2s6lbeyjbavpcvsdwnqpwxoz2fnd3av36u3kkm)\nWhile this behavior does not pose a risk to sUSD’s fundamental backing, the exit of sUSD’s price from its concentrated liquidity range reduced buy-side liquidity, thereby increasing Aave's risk to sUSD positions. This liquidity constraint underpinned the recommendation to reduce caps, aiming to mitigate Aave's risk.\n\n### Removing sUSD as Collateral\n\nWith the recent deterrence of the creation of new sUSD debt on Aave and continued minimized supply exposure, the majority of outstanding debt is fundamentally leveraged to explicitly contribute to the recent sUSD incentive programs by minimizing effective peg exposure. However, while highly overcollateralized, the current economics associated with the soft peg mechanism is fundamentally shaky; minimizing the usage of sUSD as collateral is recommended to be performed as a preventive measure. The current distribution of such sUSD-collateralized stablecoin debt positions is highly conservative, as can be seen below, thereby requiring a significant depeg to start to contribute negatively to the Aave protocol, and the expectation is such that exposure will continue to be minimized over time, as has been the case with a 3M reduction in supply on Aave (25%) over the last 7 days.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151810.268.png](ipfs://bafkreichtqxkc33sgfqdmovkfkb52lal52eksh3ynamdjoghnkt333o3fe)\n![image - 2025-01-30T151812.842.png](ipfs://bafkreifmjwarbys4s3iecgetat2nmeyxp22qa4r7jyjbsru2qlrrpapvdy)\nMoreover, during a swift depeg event 7 months ago, we proposed an immediate LTV0 change due to the deprecation of their spot synths contributing to significant downward pressure, as can be seen [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/susd-depeg-update-05-16-2024/17719). The fundamental characteristics of the asset eventually improved once more through mechanical changes on Synthetix’s side in the redemption process, leading to the unfreezing of the asset, as seen in [this](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-parameter-recommendations-susd-on-v3-optimism-05-23-2024/17779) post. However, we continued to reduce exposure in the form of decreasing caps significantly coupled with decreasing LTV/LTs in both the general market and E-Mode configuration, leading to a more conservative state. As such, a significant buffer of 6% price movement already exists between the collateral value at the LT and the bad debt threshold of 1/(1+LB) in e-mode itself.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nTo further improve this safety buffer and given the conservative distribution of collateralized debt positions throughout the stablecoin E-Mode config on Optimism, we recommend decreasing the LTV/LT in Stablecoins E-Mode while minimizing induced liquidations.\n\nConsidering the current positioning within the E-Mode, we estimate the optimal LT reduction to be 87%. While we intend to deprecate the E-Mode and remove sUSD from it progressively, this change poses an initial step in that direction. Chaos Labs will monitor the market and introduce additional Liquid E-Modes if demand for a stablecoin-correlated E-Mode remains.\n\nThe change to 87% LT is expected to cause the liquidation of just $95K of collateral.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151815.223.png](ipfs://bafkreihlu36ppeeaml3zkpfe7vuf2iqfakfent4yzb2n3i3xqnpw7ixwpm)\nThe liquidations caused at the recommended LT are primarily stablecoins with significant liquidity to support the minimal liquidation size, with sUSD liquidations only representing $2.4K, or 3.2%.\n\n![image - 2025-01-30T151817.770.png](ipfs://bafkreieomtso2cfoswuhmg6ehmc4sdsxd3wrrdtgicbzd57u44tgetqlmu)\nAdditionally, we recommend setting the LTV of sUSD outside of the Stablecoin Correlated E-Mode to 0; this measure will prevent additional borrowing from being performed using sUSD as collateral, hence limiting the future risk posed by an sUSD downward deviation. \n\nThis measure will simultaneously apply to both sUSD parameters within and outside of the E-Mode, hence limiting the opening of new positions.\n\nFollowing an improvement of the sUSD peg and a reduction in sUSD-denominated collateral, Chaos Labs will reinstate the borrow cap to a defined value determined by our methodology.\n\n## Specification\n\nFor the sUSD asset on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Asset | Deployment | Current LTV | Rec. LTV |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| sUSD | Optimism | 60.00% | 0.00% |\n\nFor the Stablecoin E-Mode on Aave V3 Optimism instance, we recommend the following:\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Rec. Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| LTV | 90.00% | 0.00% |\n| LT | 93.00% | 87.00% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n# **Disclaimer**\n\nChaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this ARFC.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain)",
