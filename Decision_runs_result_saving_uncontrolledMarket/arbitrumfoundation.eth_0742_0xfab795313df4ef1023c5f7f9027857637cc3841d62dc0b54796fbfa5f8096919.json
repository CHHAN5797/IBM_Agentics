        "body": "# Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal builds on the ideas and concepts introduced by [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) in the initial [Operation Company (OpCo) proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/the-opco-scale-structure-synergy/22737). The OpCo is a legal entity that delegates and key stakeholders can leverage to achieve DAO-defined goals, principally by forming an operational mesh layer and assigning internal employees or negotiating and entering into agreements with service providers and individual contributors to facilitate initiatives. OpCo’s mission is to negate identified frictions affecting the DAO’s strategy execution, such as allowing for the establishment of more operational roles for the DAO, facilitating efficient and competitive contributor and service provider negotiations and information flow between these parties, creating clear responsibilities for carrying out initiatives, and helping ensure the continuation of programs the DAO depends upon. OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes a potential advancement that could be made within its mandated focus areas, it can work on and propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nAs it currently stands, the Arbitrum DAO is generally unable to move swiftly when it requires specialized contributors to execute a strategy, for which there isn’t a straightforward and low-friction approach, with these processes typically requiring a vast amount of effort from the supply side instead of being driven by the demand side. Moreover, many initiatives, especially more complex and wider-reaching ones, lack clear owners in charge of ensuring a holistic approach to execution and initiatives’ continuation, meaning that in the unfortunate case that a service provider decides/is forced to disengage from its duties, there aren’t always accountable individuals or entities that would push the initiatives forward. OpCo’s goal is to function as the entity the DAO can leverage to remedy these limitations and move forward in areas that require a more structured approach.\n\nTo cover OpCo’s operating expenses over the first 30 months, including full-time staff appointed internally, setup and other admin costs, as well as the DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee, this proposal suggests earmarking 22M ARB (subject to change in either direction if market conditions change notably between the Snapshot and Tally votes) for the initiative:\n\n* 4M ARB allocated to a bonus pool for internal employees and OpCo’s oversight committee (3M reserved for internal employees and 1M reserved for the committee). If bonuses are paid out, they must be denominated in ARB and have a vesting structure attached, with internal employees’ payouts additionally being performance-based.\n* Of the remaining 18M ARB, tokens will be liquidated until $12M worth of cash equivalents has been attained. At ARB’s current price of $1, this would require roughly 12M ARB. The liquidation will occur over up to 3 months immediately following the proposal passing Tally at the discretion of the liquidating party (the Arbitrum Foundation together with a provider of their choice for asset liquidation) with a mandate to minimize price impact.\n* After subtracting the bonus allocation and the liquidation is complete, the remaining ARB of the earmarked 22M token allocation will be immediately transferred back to the DAO treasury.\n\n![ARB Liquidation.png](ipfs://bafybeifs75ocgefcebce7mgv5spdjfubengcta7ua6nz5rbrlbprbbtxvq)\n\nOpCo will be able to utilize the $12M in cash equivalents as follows:\n\n* $2.5M worth of stable assets released upfront.\n* Once OpCo has officially operationalized, the entity can draw up to $500K of cash equivalents each month.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $500K but is below $1.5M, the executive-equivalent employees must get approval from the OAT before accessing the funds.\n* If a monthly drawdown exceeds $1.5M, OpCo must seek approval from the DAO through a Snapshot vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nPresently, most DAO programs operate in silos, leading to, among other things, redundant efforts and non-existing cross-initiative resources. The DAO also generally depends on a single initiative leader for the continuation of a successful program, while some initiatives don’t even have clear owners, which adds significant friction to strategy execution. DAOs are also inherently disadvantaged when evaluating and swiftly engaging individual contributors or service providers, and Arbitrum is no exception. This proposal aims to provide the DAO with the capabilities to nullify the abovementioned frictions by creating a DAO-adjacent legal entity—OpCo. Among other things, the DAO may choose to leverage OpCo to manage:\n\n* Operational support & project planning,\n* Project management of DAO initiatives,\n* Negotiations with service providers,\n* Allocation of resources across contributors & DAO-approved projects\n\nOpCo will grant the Arbitrum DAO better capabilities to bootstrap initiatives and secure the continuation and execution of them, while also expanding the total addressable contributor and service provider base as certain sensitive negotiations and deal terms don’t necessarily have to be disclosed publicly. Moreover, the DAO-adjacent entity will function as the operational mesh layer for individual contributors and service providers, streamlining communications and knowledge sharing across engaged entities and individuals.\n\nOverall, the DAO’s past, current, and likely upcoming initiatives can be divided into 5 high-level categories: Governance Frameworks, Financial Management, Investments, Ecosystem Support, and Grants. The initiatives, their respective owners, and into which of the 5 categories they fall are visualized below.\n\n![Current Initiatives.png](ipfs://bafybeidaponefn7ospa42xhhtdhcw2v33to5yvrskyrvcxbmtagwwl24ru)\n\nIt is of utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO maintains a decentralized and bottoms-up system for bootstrapping new projects, DAO contributors, and setting strategies, including creating and steering the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose, as well as approaches to achieve the goals and decision-making. As such, OpCo will be focused on the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management initiative categories, but note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category if the DAO so chooses through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n\nThe entity’s main focus is to increase the efficiency of strategy execution through operational optimization and, in particular, activating and recruiting the optimal stakeholders, contributors, and service providers. For the avoidance of doubt, the DAO would always have ultimate authority over OpCo, with the entity purely being a helpful resource focused on streamlining wider-reaching and complex initiatives that require a more structured execution framework as well as helping push the DAO forward within areas where the entity identifies shortcomings. We want to stress the importance of ensuring that one of Arbitrum DAO’s key differentiators—enabling new participants to join the ecosystem and make an impact, growing into well-established contributors—is conserved. Without Arbitrum DAO empowering its contributors and delegates, the DAO might sacrifice one of its core strengths, and we believe that entities such as SEEDGov, Entropy Advisors, Tally, etc., are present within the ecosystem exactly because of this empowerment.\n\nArbitrum has one of the most active and engaged DAOs within the industry, combined with help from the Arbitrum Foundation and robust programs for bootstrapping and fostering growth within the ecosystem. Although there is always room for improvement, these factors have enabled the DAO to allocate grants with positive results, sustaining a vibrant and welcoming ecosystem. Having said that, if the DAO wishes to, it can expand OpCo’s mandate to include grants in the future through a Snapshot vote. When it comes to investments from treasury funds, the GCP has been established to facilitate capital allocation into the gaming sector, while the AVI is currently working on setting up a structure allowing the DAO to make venture bets across other verticals, which is why OpCo will be excluded from operating within the investments category. As alluded to earlier, we also feel as though it’s crucial that the facilitation and implementation of governance frameworks continue being driven by decentralized actors, but the DAO could again expand OpCo’s operations into this initiative category if it so wishes.\n\nWith that said, certain clear inefficiencies have been identified with respect to the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories. This is likely due to the operational frameworks enabling execution for these categories still being somewhat underexplored areas. As such, there is a lack of ownership, and the DAO has no structured way to frictionlessly operationalize contributors to push complex challenges forward within these verticals, often requiring a vast amount of Arbitrum DAO-specific knowledge and even lobbying efforts from the supply side instead of the demand side. Due to the current structure, active governance participants are generally purely incentivized to prioritize strategies that they are fit to solve. This has left certain critical domains unattended and reflects the need for an entity that could be mandated to help define the root causes of execution obstacles and provide solutions to remedy them.\n\nThe aforementioned inefficiencies are naturally amplified by the fact that the number of potential contributors is often restricted due to many initiatives requiring deep specialization. Finding the facilitators capable of managing initiatives end-to-end within these categories can be difficult. Oftentimes, the contributor and owner roles for initiatives are separated or there is not a clear owner at all, meaning that no one party is responsible for the continuation of these initiatives. For initiatives where the contributor and owner roles are the same or there is a clearly defined owner, the DAO generally relies on a single party for the continuation of the initiative. If the service provider or contributor, for any reason, decides or is forced to exit the ecosystem, there is not a well-defined framework for the initiative to be moved to a new owner.\n\nAs initiated, OpCo’s core mandate will be to enable the execution of DAO-defined strategies within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories when requested by delegates. However, OpCo is also required to be proactive, meaning that if the entity has the bandwidth and recognizes an area within its focus categories where developments could be made, it can propose a strategy through which the entity would address the identified frictions.\n\nTypically, the current protocol for the execution of strategies and new initiatives within the DAO’s two aforementioned focus areas is as follows: (i) either the proposer defines the strategic approach and goals for the initiative or a working group is created that aims to outline these specifics such that a proposal can be created, with the working group also sometimes facilitating some or all of the work required for the execution of the strategy; (ii) if not done by the working group, the proposer or proposer-connected party is contracted to facilitate the strategy or the DAO runs some type of a procurement/election process to decide the service providers or contributors; (iii) once the work has been performed and the facilitators’ term ends, a continuation proposal is created if the initiative has a clear owner. Otherwise, individual DAO contributors are required to take charge of the initiative and push it forward.\n\nIf OpCo were to be created, it would primarily be leveraged to assume responsibility for phases (ii) and (iii). I.e., the DAO defines strategies or simply strategic goals. If a clear executor to reach the key objectives exists within the DAO, they could be chosen as a facilitator and would be contracted by the OpCo. If not, OpCo could be mandated to execute these strategies by either assigning existing internal employees, hiring new internal resources, or contracting outside service providers/individual contributors to perform the required undertakings. However, if the DAO isn’t proactively defining strategies/strategic goals, OpCo is required to be active within this area as well, given it has the bandwidth to do so, with these OpCo-created strategies then ratified by the DAO through the regular voting process.\n\nOpCo would have full discretion over hiring internal employees, while anyone interested in facilitating a DAO initiative could propose themselves (or another party) for that. Such a proposal must include a capital allocation to cover the facilitator’s expenses since OpCo’s budget only covers internal employees’ salaries. If approved through governance, the facilitator would then be contracted by OpCo as a service provider for the DAO. Depending on what is viewed as the most efficient approach, OpCo will have the ability to negotiate and run procurement processes both privately and publicly, which will further strengthen the Arbitrum DAO’s ability to attract and retain top talent, with all information that can be shared with the wider DAO being made available through oversight and financial reports. The below slide depicts OpCo’s initial focus categories, but please note that with the exception of the Investments category and any emerging future categories wherein other, new DAO-adjacent legal entities are set to operate, the mandate can be expanded into any current/future initiative category.\n\n![Future Structure.png](ipfs://bafybeiewjs6bgbqbbnrswbtdxkd2f2wr6b2ymjatwwu26ojtufsxfy3u5m)\n\nIf a DAO-ratified strategy or strategic goal that the OpCo is mandated to facilitate doesn’t have a specific end date, the DAO-adjacent entity would continue executing until the entity feels as though the associated goals have been reached or the DAO instructs the entity to stop executing by passing a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). If the work is expected to be long-term in nature, OpCo would be responsible for ensuring that it can be continued by accounting for associated costs in its budget extension request.\n\nFor example, delegates could define a high-level events strategy by deciding the number of events the Arbitrum DAO should be represented at in 2025, whether the strategy facilitator is the proposer, a proposer-related party, an OpCo internal employee, or someone who is chosen through a procurement process, and approving the strategy’s costs that are not covered by OpCo’s budget (i.e., salaries if the facilitators are not full-time staff appointed internally, booking event venues, catering, etc.) through the typical governance process, after which OpCo plans the exact events to participate in, contracts the required service providers or operationalizes internal employees, and manages all involved stakeholders and other related aspects throughout the process.\n\nService providers and individual contributors that are currently contracted, or will likely be in the near future, with the Arbitrum Foundation and fall within the Financial Management and Ecosystem Support categories, such as SEEDGov in its role as the Delegate Incentive Program Manager, MSS members, firms forming the ADPC, Entropy Advisors, etc., should collaborate closely with OpCo once its operations are fully established and stabilized. Once fully operational, OpCo will have the capacity to project manage and oversee these initiatives according to its complete mandate. The long-term vision for this process is as follows:\n\n1. OpCo’s core team is hired, and operations begin;\n2. OpCo demonstrates product-market fit (i.e., the DAO is satisfied with the entity’s output) and that it has adequate processes, capabilities, and any other relevant functions to execute according to its complete mandate;\n3. OpCo is prepared to oversee full-time DAO operations, assuming existing contributor contracts through novation and managing new initiatives on behalf of the DAO (e.g., by ensuring that appropriate KYC measures and documentation are implemented).\n\nIn the case that an integral facilitator within the Ecosystem Support or Financial Management categories (or any other category OpCo might be mandated to operate within in the future) exits the ecosystem for any reason and an initiative is left without an owner, the DAO could likewise mandate OpCo to find a replacement solution.\n\nIt’s important to note that OpCo will not have the authority to enter into contracts with service providers or individual contributors for strategies not approved by the DAO through governance, unless directly related to its operational needs (e.g., hiring an accounting firm). OpCo internal full-time employees cannot be contributors to DAO initiatives as individuals (they need to do so through OpCo) and are strictly prohibited from entering into employment engagements with other DAOs, organizations, entities, or comparable affiliations, whilst contractors that facilitate a specific vertical and are signed to OpCo can have engagements in other DAO initiatives and outside of the ecosystem. Full-time OpCo staff can only be appointed internally. However, as mentioned earlier, the DAO can roll any service provider or individual contributor into OpCo by passing an onchain vote. This vote has to request capital to cover the facilitators’ expenses since when it comes to salaries, OpCo’s budget only covers internal full-time staff. OpCo is expected to work closely with Offchain Labs as well as the Arbitrum Foundation to ensure that scopes of work do not overlap.\n\nIndividual contributors, service providers, and other analogous entities are naturally free to go directly to the DAO to propose they facilitate a workstream and get paid for it without facilitation by the OpCo. However, if the proposed scope of work falls within OpCo’s mandate, it is expected that delegates vote against such a proposal if it can be better executed via OpCo’s involvement. Proposers will be encouraged to engage with OpCo before posting a proposal to the forum to align with the DAO-adjacent entity’s internal employees. OpCo’s internal employees will also proactively communicate with proposal authors and facilitators outside of OpCo such that there is no overlap between deliverables and the future plans for all initiatives are clear.\n\nFinally, it’s crucial to mention that the introduction of a DAO-adjacent legal entity carries risks and burdens that shouldn’t be ignored. Among other things, it requires some trust in a select group of facilitators as they are responsible for hiring and procuring the correct contributors as well as operationalizing and managing the DAO-adjacent entity, OpCo’s setup and fixed costs are quite notable, and some amount of administrative work is required that otherwise wouldn’t have arisen.\n\n# Specifications\n\n## OpCo Operational Process\n\nWe expect the general workflow for OpCo to be as follows:\n\n* A forum discussion is initiated, with the owner of that discussion having communicated with OpCo and defined whether the covered subject falls within OpCo’s initial mandate, i.e., the Financial Management or Ecosystem Support verticals.\n* For verticals that are included in OpCo’s mandate, a discussion could broadly take one of the following forms:\n  * A new key objective is introduced, but the roadmap to achieve that objective is unclear: Delegates have the option to create a Snapshot proposal to direct OpCo to produce an onchain proposal that defines the strategy to achieve the key objective(s), whether the entity would procure a facilitator or hire/operationalize an internal employee, as well as any funds needed to cover the strategy’s expenses, excluding OpCo’s internal employee costs. If approved, OpCo would begin facilitating the proposal created by itself. It’s important to note that OpCo, together with its oversight committee (OAT), is responsible for keeping the DAO informed about the entity’s bandwidth. They’ll also provide updates on when current projects are expected to end. This ensures that if there is a sudden spike in new proposals, especially complex and more time-intensive ones, delegates can prioritize and vote on the ones OpCo can take on.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, but the incentive program’s structure and size are unclear. A proposal is passed for OpCo to operationalize internal employees and create the exact strategy. OpCo then defines, e.g., the amount of incentives to be distributed, what the application process to receive incentives looks like, how success will be measured, etc. A proposal to ratify the strategy, the incentives to be distributed, and the required workforce is then created. If passed, OpCo will activate the needed facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) and strategy execution begins.\n  * A new key objective is introduced and the roadmap to achieve that objective is clear: Delegates approve an onchain proposal that defines the strategy, whether the facilitator is the proposer, proposer-related party, an internal OpCo employee, or someone the OpCo procures, and the related expenses excluding facilitator fees for internal OpCo employees, after which strategy execution begins. If a proposal introduces a new key objective with a clear roadmap but that roadmap is ambitious, the OAT together with OpCo should signal how feasible it is for the entity to execute the proposal. If it’s determined that such a roadmap is feasible, the OAT together with OpCo would also communicate whether or not the entity needs more internal resources to be able to execute.\n    * Example: The DAO wants to run an incentive program to expand the ecosystem, and the structure and size are clear. An onchain proposal to ratify the strategy, the facilitators, and the capital needed is then created. If passed, the required facilitators (program manager, data team, etc.) are contracted by OpCo, or OpCo operationalizes/hires internal employees, depending on the DAO’s decision, and the strategy is activated.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n* Proposals and their execution can still be DAO-led end-to-end and outside of OpCo if delegates vote in this regard. OpCo is a tool for the DAO to leverage if needed.\n* The DAO-adjacent entity is required to be proactive, meaning that internal employees need to actively give feedback in the forums and participate in opinionated discussions.\n* Furthermore, if OpCo has available bandwidth, it should identify areas within its mandated verticals where improvements could be made. If there is no clear owner for such areas and addressing them would benefit the DAO, OpCo should take action. OpCo can create a proposal to define the strategy for addressing the targeted area, requesting funds to cover expenses, excluding costs for OpCo’s internal employees and other related operating expenses, and authorizing the DAO-adjacent entity to operationalize facilitators to execute the strategy.\n\nOpCo’s initial capital allocation is meant to cover the entity’s setup costs and operating expenses, including full-time internal staff salaries, recurring administrative costs, and OpCo’s oversight committee. After OpCo’s core team has been hired, the entity has demonstrated product-market fit and readiness to execute according to its complete mandate, OpCo could be leveraged to help develop a DAO-wide budget, in which case the DAO-adjacent entity could hold the budgeted capital for at least the Ecosystem Support and Financial Management categories. In this case, when proposals related to these verticals are passed, no capital would have to be moved from the treasury as OpCo would be able to cover all expenses from its holdings.\n\n## Establishing OpCo\n\nExploratory work on OpCo’s legal structure has already been initiated, but further effort and consultation with key stakeholders, delegates, legal parties, and the Arbitrum Foundation are needed to hammer down the exact structure. Any costs incurred by the Foundation for setting up the legal structure would be reimbursed from capital allocated to this initiative if this proposal were to pass.\n\nOpCo’s initial term will tentatively be 30 months (around 6 months for setup and 24 months for operations from the entity’s official initiation date). The initial term’s length has been chosen to allow ample time for any unforeseen delays in establishing the legal entity, ramping up and stabilizing its operations, and will enable OpCo to focus on more complex and long-term strategies and internalize top talent as a longer initial term provides predictability/job security for employees. Once the first term is coming to an end, the executive-equivalent internal personnel together with OpCo’s oversight committee—the Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT), introduced below—are required to collaborate to create the continuation proposal for the DAO-adjacent entity. This is expected to cover, among other things, the second OpCo term’s length, the required budget, and any changes or improvements that should be made. It should be noted that if OpCo is required to internalize a vast amount of facilitator roles before a DAO-wide budget is put in place, OpCo might have to create a proposal that would allocate additional funds as its initial exemplary budget has been constructed to cover up to 12 internal full-time employees at different salaries.\n\nTo enable OpCo to successfully fulfill its mandate, the entity should, among other things, have the following initial operational capabilities, internal employees, and resources:\n\n* Internal Finances, Financial Rails, and Controls\n  * Appoint an external accounting and audit firm to maintain financial records and create yearly audits of financial statements and internal controls.\n  * Banking capabilities to be able to convert stablecoins into fiat currency and pay service providers not accepting tokens.\n* Legal\n  * Hire a full-time, in-house legal counsel.\n  * Obtain the required insurances that cover the DAO-adjacent entity as well as internal employees and the OAT.\n* Business-Critical Software\n  * Acquire any needed collaboration and communication tools, accounting and financial management software, human resources management systems, etc.\n* Internal Executive-Equivalent Employees\n  * Chief Chaos Coordinator\n    * Ensures that OpCo has the required internal resources, employees, and contracted service providers such that the DAO-adjacent entity can operate properly and execute strategies mandated by the DAO.\n    * Responsible for building and advancing the entity’s operational structure and managing workflows as initiatives are rolled into the organization and new focus areas are introduced.\n    * Similarly to other executive-equivalent personnel, accountable for adequate record keeping and internal controls.\n    * Collaborates with any other executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT to produce bi-annual oversight and financial reports.\n    * Together with executive-equivalent personnel and the OAT, in charge of creating the continuation proposal for OpCo’s next term.\n  * Chief of Coins\n    * Works with the relevant parties to produce a detailed, actual budget for OpCo, ratified by the OAT and the DAO. In the future, we expect the Chief of Coins to help facilitate a DAO-wide budget together with the relevant parties.\n    * Before a DAO-wide budget is created, responsible for requesting additional funds to ensure the entity’s operations if capital allocated for OpCo’s OpEx is close to being depleted.\n    * Verifies that allocated funds are custodied in a secure manner and utilized as intended.\n    * Makes sure that the OAT and the DAO have required visibility into ongoing expenses, how financials are expected to develop, and any other relevant considerations.\n    * Monitors Arbitrum’s financial performance and makes new recommendations based on this information.\n    * Closely collaborates with entities and individuals responsible for treasury management-related tasks, enabling the creation of a unified asset allocation and risk diversification strategy in line with the DAO’s vision, mission, and purpose.\n    * Manages accounting, payroll, and payment infrastructure.\n\n## OpCo KPIs\n\nWe are looking for community feedback on this front, but some potential, apparent KPIs for OpCo (h/t [@dk3](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/u/dk3) for most of these) include:\n\n* Talent Acquisition, Service Provider Selection, and Program Management\n  * Decrease in time-to-hire, compared to the DAO’s previous structure\n  * Employee engagement and satisfaction\n  * Retention rate\n  * Share of service providers meeting or exceeding performance metrics\n  * Cost savings or added value generated\n  * Diversity of service providers engaged\n* Ecosystem Coordination\n  * Time to solve open questions and other ambiguities\n  * Number of initiatives facilitated and their success\n  * Level of community engagement and stakeholder satisfaction\n  * Agility in adapting objectives\n  * Share of OpCo-initiated strategies accepted by the DAO\n* Performance Tracking and Transparency\n  * Timeliness of oversight and financial reports\n  * Share of data and metrics made publicly available\n  * Community engagement with reports\n\nUltimately, the OAT will be responsible for designing, finalizing, and implementing the relevant KPIs once OpCo is at a point where this can be sufficiently done. We envision that this will be a collaborative effort between the OAT and the DAO, with KPIs reviewed and adjusted periodically based on how OpCo evolves and the community’s feedback.\n\n## OpCo Accountability – The Oversight and Transparency Committee (OAT)\n\nThe OAT is a group of five individuals with the primary mandate to oversee OpCo’s operations, ensure the DAO maintains transparency into the DAO-adjacent entity, function as the coordinator between the DAO and OpCo, and establish clear communication channels with the other committees overseeing the separate DAO-adjacent entities such as the GCP and possibly the CapCo in the future should the DAO vote accordingly. More specifically, the OAT’s responsibilities include but are not limited to:\n\n* Accountability: Ensures that OpCo is not overstepping its mandate, over-hiring doesn’t take place, and execution is constrained solely to strategies approved by the DAO. Holds the executive-equivalent personnel accountable, helps produce and approves bi-annual oversight and financial reports, designs relevant KPIs for OpCo once the entity is at a point where this can be sufficiently done, and gives other quarterly updates to the community (such as how OpCo is progressing towards the KPIs designed by the OAT, any operational developments, etc.), reviews all relevant internal materials, and monitors that funds held in OpCo-related wallets are used correctly.\n* Operational Support: Provides assistance in the entity’s legal setup process, gives guidance on OpCo’s operational development, assists the executive-equivalent personnel in producing a continuation proposal for OpCo, and continuously guides OpCo-related contributors to align with the DAO’s will.\n* Hiring, Termination, & Authorization: The OAT, in collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation, would hire the executive-equivalent personnel to the OpCo (the Chief Chaos Coordinator, the Chief of Coins, and any other positions of equivalent responsibility that may be introduced in the future) once the legal entity is established. The OAT will help onboard the executive-equivalent personnel and assist in the creation of a standardized onboarding process for future internal employees such that new hires’ expectations are managed properly. Once the first internal employees are hired, the OAT would act as the approving authority when OpCo enters into contracts with service providers or individual contributors, as well as greenlight salaries, larger spends, expenses, and budgets, having the authority to challenge decisions made within OpCo that may have a material, negative impact. Moreover, the OAT would be empowered to terminate service provider/individual contributor/etc. contracts as well as fire OpCo’s internal staff. If the OAT decides to take such an action, the concerned party will be suspended from their duties, and payments will be halted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Removal of OAT Members: OAT Members may be removed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, a violation of a conflict of interest or other OpCo policies. In the event of a violation: (A) an OAT Member may call up an internal vote for removal with a memo detailing the alleged violation; (B) for a vote to remove an OAT Member to pass, it must have at least 4 out of the 5 OAT Members voting in favor; and (C) the ArbitrumDAO may also call for a vote to remove OAT Members at any time pursuant to a Temperature Check vote in accordance with the quorum and voting threshold requirements of a Temperature Check. The OpCo Team has the ability to call for a Temperature Check vote to remove an OAT Member as voted upon by the ArbitrumDAO. (i) The OpCo Team member may flag to another OpCo Team member that an election to remove an OAT Member via a Temperature Check vote is warranted; (ii) If such other OpCo Team member considers the request for removal to be warranted, then the OpCo Team member who originally made the flag may call for a removal election (subject to a 3 day feedback period, followed by a 7 day voting period) as a Temperature Check vote; (iii) In the event that a call to remove fails, the OpCo Team member who called for such Temperature Check vote cannot call another vote for removal for a period of 3 months. The process for electing a replacement for a removed OAT member will be equivalent to how the removed member was elected. I.e., if the removed member was elected through a DAO vote, the replacement member will be elected through a DAO vote. If the removed member was elected by the OAT, the OAT will elect the replacement member. A removed OAT member cannot be reappointed to the OAT. Further details on the OAT election process are given below.\n* Coordination: Actively engage with Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum Foundation to align on deliverables and serve as the liaison between delegates, key stakeholders, the wider DAO, and other DAO-adjacent entities’ oversight committees. The OAT will also initiate a monthly OpCo oversight call for community members to get updates on the most recent developments and for them to have the opportunity to make inquiries. A separate forum section will be created for OpCo.\n\n## OAT Election Process\n\nIf this proposal were to pass Snapshot, the formation of the Oversight and Transparency Committee would commence. The DAO would elect 3 individuals to the OAT, with these individuals then promptly appointing 2 additional members with specialized skill sets to ensure all Arbitrum stakeholders’ interests are represented and the OAT’s proficiencies are varied and complete. Additionally, the Arbitrum Foundation will be given an observing and non-voting sixth seat on the OAT similar to the GCP. OAT members are expected to be able to contribute at least 10 hours per week to OAT-related tasks.\n\nOAT applicants are required to apply as individuals to increase accountability. Applicants are required to disclose any current or possible future conflicts of interest in their applications, including but not limited to financial, personal, and professional. Applicants are also required to disclose all active contributor roles and payment streams related to the Arbitrum DAO that they, and entities that they have a professional or financial relationship with, have and are receiving. The application process for the 3 DAO-elected members would be initiated soon after the OpCo proposal passes an offchain vote and would run for ~3 weeks. Note that the application period can be extended if the size of the applicant pool is limited. A shutterized, weighted voting system will be utilized on Snapshot, and the 3 applicants with the most votes will be chosen as members of the OAT. The DAO-elected members should then prioritize appointing 2 additional members (required to be individuals as well). The 2 additional members don’t have to be appointed at the same time. The additional members will be added to the OAT optimistically, with the DAO having the ability to reject either/both of the additional members through a Snapshot vote (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”). All members will serve until the end of the first OAT term unless removed or they resign.\n\nWhile the same internal OpCo employees as well as contracted service providers and individual contributors will continue in their roles across OpCo’s terms if the DAO-adjacent entity is extended in the future, the OAT’s term is 12 months, with a re-election process initiated when the OAT’s term has around 3 months left. The DAO would again choose 3 members who then appoint 2 additional members. If the new cohort is different from the previous one, the previous OAT members are expected to help onboard the new members when the term is coming to an end. There are no consecutive term limits for OAT members. As the OAT is mandated to assist in OpCo’s setup process, the first OAT term will be slightly longer than subsequent ones since it will include the period from when the initial OAT members are selected to the establishment of the entity, plus 12 months from the entity’s official start date.\n\nAny individual may apply to the OAT. However, all appointed individuals that have a non-observing seat, as well as any companies with which these appointees maintain a professional or financial relationship, are required to relinquish any and all contributor roles within the Arbitrum DAO that were obtained through an official election or ratification process conducted via Snapshot or Tally. As long as an individual has a non-obseving seat on the OAT, they and their affiliates as defined above are prohibited from becoming an internal employee for OpCo, entering into service provider contracts with the entity, and applying to a contributor role related to the Arbitrum DAO that requires an official election or ratification process through Snapshot or Tally. Due to legal constraints, an OAT member and their affiliates as defined above cannot be members of another initiative’s or DAO-adjacent entity’s oversight committee. If an appointed individual or their affiliate as defined above sits on another oversight committee(s), they are required to resign from any such position(s) to be able to join the OAT.\n\n# NOTE: Due to Snapshot's character limit and the length of this proposal, the following sections have been omitted from this text compared to the forum post: OAT Applicant Requirements, OAT Compensation Structure, Governance and Compliance Requirements for OpCo, its Internal Employees, and the OAT, OpCo Financials and Costs, Snapshot Voting Structure, and Timeline.

        "body": "Non-Constitutional\n\nAbstract\nTLDR: This proposal funds a coalition led by Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits in order to aid in turning Arbitrum DAO members’ ideas into reality for a term of 12 months.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition is an organization initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits. The Coalition aims to execute turnkey R&D work on behalf of the Arbitrum DAO. The Coalition’s mandate is to help steer the path from ideation in the forum to the optimal, efficient, and safe execution of proposals. In other words, being a steward in making the DAO’s visions a reality. The coalition will provide the necessary resources so that the DAO can make informed decisions.\n\nMotivation\nThe Arbitrum forum includes many worthwhile suggestions, but often lacks the required research, coordination, design, and risk assessment to move forward optimally. For example, iterating on proposals, drumming up delegate awareness, and finding the necessary partners to execute an idea are often difficult tasks. The Arbitrum Coalition’s mandate is to help distill information and accelerate governance decision-making so DAO participants can make informed decisions.\n\nThe Coalition has best-in-class experience/specialized expertise and personnel to execute on this venture and are all already notable contributors to the DAO. Areas of expertise include but are not limited to research, framework creation, risk assessment, secure code reviews, threat modeling, and testing enhancements.The Coalition will take the necessary steps to ensure the Arbitrum DAO has the resources it needs to accomplish its goals.\n\nAs a case study demonstrating the need for the Coalition, there was a lot of discussion around returning tokens 3 accidentally sent to the airdrop address back to the recipients. However, there was no one to call on to look at the landscape of how other protocols deal with this issue, design and implement a mechanism, or take it through the governance process. Likewise, the DAO has seen multiple grant programs suggested but has not been able to assess what has worked or not worked for similar programs in the past from an objective perspective. A multitude of such cases can be seen over Arbitrum DAO’s short tenure. These are the exact roles the coalition will undertake for ideas that gain traction among DAO stakeholders.\n\nHad the coalition existed during the time of the STIP proposal, it would have played a pivotal role in alleviating many of the inefficiencies and challenges delegates faced in the process. Blockworks Research and Gauntlet would have been prepared to develop comprehensive resources in support of the program end-to-end. From simplifying the evaluation of proposals with concise explanations and quantitative analysis to simplifying the voting process for delegates, and ultimately eliminating the need for a second process aimed at finding a service provider to monitor and analyze the program once live, by doing it ourselves. While we did make modest contributions in this regard 4 [2 1], our commitment would have been backed by substantially greater resources. In addition, the Coalition would (and will, should this proposal pass) do its own analysis of how this STIP program performed (after the fact) and provide feedback and recommendations on how to improve it in the future. The Coalition would have advocated for streamlined voting methods in place of 105 separate votes and created efficient voting dashboards, reducing the reliance on last-minute community-funded solutions. While it’s a missed opportunity, it highlights the potential for future value.\n\nAdditionally, complex mechanism designs like creating a permissionless validator set (BOLD) and sequencer design (timeboost) can be made more easily understandable for ARB delegates with support from the Coalition and researched impartially versus other potential solutions when proposals of this nature inevitably go on the forum.\n\nThe Coalition will help community stakeholders make the best possible decisions when it comes to AIPs. For example, Trail of Bits will aim to review each onchain proposal’s source code to ensure it achieves what is stated. This code review ability is a feat many delegates cannot achieve on their own and will be extremely useful to enable competent voting. Blockworks Research will distill the competitive landscape and underlying technology and Gauntlet will be able assess potential risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nAn example that demonstrates the value the Coalition will provide relates to support decision-making for the Arbitrum Plutus DAO proposal to Activate ARB Staking 8. Adding an inflation rate to the token poses concerns around risks to the token, new independently created staking contracts would need to be audited, and it would be helpful if delegates had access to quantitative research surrounding how inflation has impacted other tokens in the past. The Coalition can work together to provide objective analysis, quantitative research, and, if desired by the community, audits and execution for this proposal and others like it.\n\nThe Arbitrum Coalition will help the DAO reduce friction and operate effectively. Having three of the most experienced service providers in crypto best positioned and resourced to act at the behest of the DAO will be a tremendous value add.\n\nRationale\nOne key difference between Arbitrum and many other protocols is the immense power given to the DAO at token generation, which makes the DAO fully responsible for the coordination and growth of the protocol.\n\nArbitrum’s impressive decentralization demonstrates that the DAO can’t rely on single entities such as Offchain Labs or the Arbitrum Foundation. Any steps taken to help create a robust decentralized ecosystem of service providers so that the DAO is not dependent on any single entity is a step in the right direction. This way if any one organization falls, is negatively regulated, or otherwise encumbered, the protocol continues to march forward. The Arbitrum Coalition is the first initiative toward this overarching goal.\n\nAdditionally, the Coalition will aid in bringing more service providers subservient to the DAO. For example, it can be a steward in creating a methodology for other budgeted entities to come into existence.\n\nOther DAOs have a diverse ecosystem of service providers who help the DAO operate efficiently. The Coalition will be the first entity working towards this overarching structure such that over time the DAO will have an ecosystem of service providers executing on key roles like grants, development, growth, risk, legal, and more. This is a necessity in maintaining a truly decentralized and efficiently operating DAO.\n\nTwo additional benefits to funding the coalition will be the professionalization of DAO undertakings and growth for Arbitrum. All representatives of the coalition are professional and will bring competent and effective work and communication into the DAO that should help proposals move along with less friction. Additionally, the entities involved have a combined audience of far over 500,000 and will be sure to produce public content on the work we do for the DAO to hopefully drive more users and developers into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Coalition’s purpose is not to replace delegates, but rather to support, serve, and empower both them and the community as a whole with tools and deep insights to streamline effective decision making.\n\nIntroduction to The Coalition\nTrail of Bits: Since 2012, Trail of Bits has helped secure some of the world’s most targeted organizations and devices. They combine high-end security research with a real-world attacker mentality to reduce risk and fortify code. They have worked extensively with Offchain Labs and performed over 1,800 hours of security review of Arbitrum through four focused engagements, including Nitro and Arbitrum V2. Many firms in DeFi, including Optimism, Balancer, Uniswap, and Compound 1 trust Trail of Bits expertise to help secure their code, and you can find many more in their Publications repository. They’ve succeeded in finding vulnerabilities in highly verified systems 1 and providing the best solutions regardless of whether they invented them. They are relentless about raising the baseline in the communities they work, and have developed and made freely available some of the most-used security tools, reference guides, and security 1 research in the industry.\n\nGauntlet: Gauntlet 3’s quantitative optimization solutions drive rapid and sustainable growth for DeFi’s top protocols, DAOs, and ecosystems through research 2, reports 2, products 2, and bespoke engagements 4. Gauntlet has the longest track record in DeFi risk management, with a managed peak at $40+B for DeFi protocols such as Aave and Compound.\n\nBlockworks Research: Blockworks Research 1 is a team of analysts that delivers institutional-grade data-driven research and analysis for L1s, L2s, DeFi, and gaming/consumer applications. Our team is well-known in the industry for producing high-quality, actionable research reports and data dashboards covering various topics, including L2s, dApps, tokenomics, technical upgrades, emerging trends, governance, MEV, and market analysis. The team is divided into protocol-specific coverage so that our analysts are experts in their respective niches. Blockworks Research is a branch of Blockworks 1, a media company hosting conferences, podcasts, and an editorial site.\n\nKey Terms\nThe Arbitrum Coalition (“the Coalition”): A group initially made up of Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits whose mandate is to empower delegates with resources for making the most informed decisions possible.\n\nDAO Advocate: A single designated entity that maintains the ability to direct the coalition’s efforts. Functions as a referee between the DAO and the coalition. We suggest L2BEAT fulfill the role of the Advocate as a proven good actor for the Arbitrum DAO given their contributions and status in the DAO. The advocate will receive a stipend of $8,000 per month for their work. The advocate’s main responsibility is ensuring the DAO’s best interests are met by the Coalition.\n\nCoalition Member Termination: Ultimately, and above all, this Coalition will exist to serve the Arbitrum DAO. As such, individual members of the Coalition can be considered for replacement if their service does not meet the standards of this proposal or the DAO’s expectation. In the scenario a Coalition Member is considered for replacement, the DAO will need to examine the list of alternative vendors as well as any new market entrants eligible for consideration and pass a vote through\na Snapshot vote (reaching quorum) to stop the following payments to the vendor and replace said entity with a counterpart. The Coalition member will be considered terminated upon the vote passing. The same process may be executed in order to terminate and stop the stream of funds for the entirety of the Coalition and/or the DAO Advocate.\n\nCoalition Member Exit: As a malleable entity, if a member of the Arbitrum Coalition wishes to exit for any reason, they may do so by providing a two week lead time of departure and offer a list of viable replacements. Payments to the Member will stop 14 days after notice is given.\n\nSpecifications\nThe advocate will have the ability to call on the coalition for R&D efforts at their discretion and act as the DAO’s representative to ensure that the Coalition is working on the most value-added initiatives and providing beyond satisfactory value. The advocate will solely act on the DAO’s behalf and function as a facilitator. From analysis, to modeling, to payload the Coalition will tackle and streamline workstreams together.\n\nThe roles of the Coalition include but are not limited to:\n\nTrail of Bits: Reviewing onchain upgrade proposals to ensure that they align with the design and specification of the proposal through whitebox source code reviews. This role is particularly important given the prevalence of governance attacks, as seen with Tornado Cash. When no proposal requires a code review, Trail of Bits will focus on building content to help review further proposals, including tools (dedicated Slither detectors, fuzzing harness, proposal state diff visualizer, … ) and educational material (tutorial, checklist, code walkthrough, …)\n\nGauntlet: Will empower the Arbitrum DAO with an understanding of the optimal path for growth through our quantitative work. Decisions in ecosystems, specifically DeFi, benefit from design, research, and modeling to determine how to incentivize usage, maximize economic efficiency, protect systemic health, and plan for the future with rigorously validated insights. Examples of some recent work include Aave Killswitch 1, Uniswap incentive design 1, ongoing Arbitrum USDC migration 1, and Cost of MEV: Quantifying Economic (un)Fairness in the Decentralized World 1.\n\nBlockworks Research: Will provide objective data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context, competitive environments, and make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. Additionally, Blockworks Research will function as the project manager handling logistics such as communication with the DAO and speaking with delegates. BWR is also able to input on mechanism design.\n\nThe Advocate is not a part of the coalition and exists purely to facilitate the DAO’s interests and direct the coalition. The Advocate is a representative of the DAO.\n\nWe believe it pertinent to get The Coalition stood up with haste and that Blockworks Research, Gauntlet, and Trail of Bits make up ideal initial members. That said, The Coalition is a malleable entity that can change, expand, and contract in domains and members as the DAO wishes. The Advocate as L2BEAT, likewise, should be looked at as a temporary seat that is always open to change. At the end of the 12 month period the domains and members should be reevaluated based on performance, lessons learned, and the adapting needs of the DAO as expected for the following 12 months.\n\nProjects\nThe Arbitrum Coalition aims to provide the following services as a first priority\n\nForum Proposal Review [BWR]\nWill provide impartial data-driven research surrounding proposals to help delegates understand the context and competitive environments such that they can make more informed decisions. These reports may also be used as a tool for those writing proposals to improve their work. The Advocate will direct the frequency and research topics of this work.\nReview on chain proposal code updates [Trail of Bits]\nWhite box security review of source code through a combination of manual and automated review, which may include a review the proposal for design flaws and identifying security and correctness properties\nReviews do not include proposals that are initiated by Offchain Labs and the Arbitrum foundation. These proposals are already going through security reviews (including by Trail of Bits)\nJust-In-Time Quants [Gauntlet]\nGauntlet’s Applied Research 4 and Risk teams will deliver quantitative review, research, and modeling or simulation for DAO proposals and initiatives relating to economic risk, design, or optimization.\nArbitrum Ecosystem Risk Dashboard [Gauntlet]\nA public ecosystem risk dashboard, similar to Aave 3 and Compound 1, provides users, investors, and voters continuous visibility into market risk throughout the ecosystem. Market risk metrics will include Volatility, CEX/DEX liquidity, and Gauntlet Safety Ratings, to inform ongoing risk-return optimizations. Gauntlet will hold monthly Risk Training sessions on how to use the dashboard from deployment to adoption and beyond.\nService Provider Onboarding Framework [BWR]\nEstablish a framework that the DAO may choose to utilize as a tool for onboarding future service providers.\nThe framework will include potential requirements and criteria; solutions for checks and balances; onboarding and offboarding processes for additional service providers including but not limited to legal counsel, operations, engineering, and marketing. All potential service providers can be thoroughly vetted by BWR, if the DAO chooses, ensuring sufficient staffing and resource availability.\nFollowing the DAO signaling an appetite for such an activity, Blockworks Research can propose and host a service provider onboarding process. The initial proposal will attempt to allocate a budget of ARB that service providers can then apply to receive a portion of through an RFP. The DAO will then vote which service providers to onboard. Recruiting, criteria, the process, budgeting suggestions, and facilitation can be handled by The Coalition. Though BWR is happy to take the proposal through the process, the DAO may opt to use the framework in any capacity it wishes, including ones that exclude BWR from future involvement.\nProject Management [BWR]\nWill handle communication with DAO surrounding coalition activities. Additionally, it will be the point of contact for DAO stakeholders and service providers. Blockworks is responsible for the overall execution of the coalition, documenting its success, escalating issues, and recommending solutions. Blockworks will maintain its own governance process to ensure continuity.\nOnce the first priority services are met, the Arbitrum Coalition can provide the following. Though these are examples of activities that can be executed on, the DAO, through The Advocate, will have decision making power over the scope of the coalition’s work.\n\nTooling Creation and Enhancement [Trail of Bits]\n\nDevelop and enhance tooling to enhance the security of the Arbitrum ecosystem and its proposals, including:\nSpecific static analysis bug detectors targeting code update.\nDevelop fuzzing capabilities to test the validity of the new upgrade states and verify that the state changing will not break any invariant\nVisualize the state of the governance contracts, in particular: the state of previous proposals, current emitted and delegates votes, how the tokens are delegated,\nVisualize and verify correct encoding of values used in the governance contracts and the action contracts.\nEducational material [Trail of Bits]\n\nProvide educational material and guidelines for reviewing upgrades procedures, including: Tutorials, Checklists, Code walkthrough\nResearch New Mechanisms [BWR]\n\nObjectively analyze and contribute to the design of new and existing mechanisms such as sequencers, fraud proofs, data availability solutions, and more. All research will be data and evidence driven evidence, where available. Projects to be prioritized by The Advocate.\nDelegate Engagement [BWR]\n\nWill create processes that incentivize delegates to be more active contributors to proposals rather than passive reviewers. For instance, a delegate incentives framework with accompanying requirements. Additionally, host regular cadence calls with delegates and those that authored proposals to work together on iteration.\nGrowth Initiatives [BWR]\n\nWill produce content surrounding coalition activities. Blockworks Research’s podcast, 0xResearch, will feature a segment on a weekly basis throughout the coalition’s term that will discuss the latest updates in Arbitrum the protocol or governance. Additionally, Twitter threads and newsletter mentions will be regularly provided in order to attract more developers and users into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nCosts\nThe total cost of the coalition for the 1-year term will be based on the 30-day VWAP price of ARB on the day prior to the onchain proposal. One quarter of payment will be paid upfront to each Coalition Member, with a 274 day stream of the following ¾ starting 91 days from the AIP’s execution. The stream of funds will remain in DAO control and can be cut off at any time through an onchain DAO proposal. As of the ARB price on October 25th, this proposal is estimated to cos",

        "body": "# Non-Constitutional\n\n# Abstract\n\nFollowing the passing of the [Unifying Arbitrum’s Mission, Vision, Purpose (MVP)](https://v1.snapshot.box/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth/proposal/0xf5fdce242b85134153397754d25a43a49611a3e8a1c73b2e11a67e864c56e022) proposal, we’re moving to the next step in aligning the Arbitrum DAO on its end-state goals and the more granular strategies through which these will be reached. Arbitrum Strategic Objective Setting (SOS) is an initiative through which DAO members will be able to propose and vote on a cohesive set of short- to mid-term objectives in a collective, inclusive, and adaptable way.\n\nThrough the SOS, any contributor can submit a set of short-term (1-year) and mid-term (2-year) objectives and related tangible key results for the DAO. The set of objectives should directly drive the DAO closer to reaching its vision, and align with the mission and purpose, as listed in the MVP proposal. The DAO will then vote on the proposed sets of objectives to select a single collection for implementation.\n\nEvery 12 months, the chosen objective set will be reviewed and, if needed, revised based on changing market conditions, the competitive environment, progress made in the past year, etc. In order to keep the DAO up to date with the progress towards each strategic objective, we suggest the research member of the ARDC be tasked with providing quarterly reports assessing how the DAO has improved through proposals and initiatives as well as suggesting what areas require more attention while recommending solutions to address these areas.\n\nOnce a set of objectives and related key results has been approved, Entropy will strive to build a budgeting framework where each high-level objective is allocated a certain amount of capital on a yearly basis, with interested contributors having the ability to request a share of this capital through a standardized structure. It’s important to note that contributors will still maintain the ability to post standalone proposals outside of this structure and are not forced to tie their initiative to the MVP/SOS/budget framework. Having said that, as the established objectives should be regarded as one of the DAO’s highest priorities, contributors should expect more friction when it comes to passing a proposal that doesn’t reasonably demonstrate that it fits within the established short- to medium-term objectives. In other words, while the freedom to make proposals that fall outside the SOS will not cease to exist, we expect that the DAO will discourage it via the creation of a social contract among delegates.\n\n# Motivation & Rationale\n\nDiversity is undeniably one of Arbitrum DAO’s strengths. We have hundreds of delegates from all around the world with varying perspectives, cultural behaviors, interests, incentives, etc. This is a double-edged sword, however, as it makes it more demanding to converge on unified goals and interim focus areas. The absence of concrete and agreed-upon goals today makes it challenging for the DAO to review progress and facilitate accountability, while it may be unclear to contributors what deliverables they should be prioritizing. Similar to the MVP proposal, the SOS takes inspiration from [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355)’s approach to materializing short- and medium-term objectives for the DAO.\n\nBy establishing clear short- and mid-term strategic objectives and key results, the outcome of the SOS will serve as a roadmap that will bring cohesion and direction to the DAO’s activities. This structured approach will enable the DAO to move beyond reactive governance and toward proactive strategic development. Having well-defined objectives allows the DAO to measure progress better, identify operational gaps, and adjust course when needed.\n\nThese objectives will create a shared foundation for evaluating opportunities across the DAO’s diverse contributor base. When assessing new initiatives or responding to market developments, delegates and contributors will have tangible criteria to inform their choices. This alignment will help prevent the dilution of efforts that can occur in DAOs, ensuring collective resources and energy are directed towards Arbitrum’s most important goals. A regular review cycle ensures the DAO’s objectives remain responsive to changing conditions while maintaining momentum toward the mission, vision, and purpose. If the MVP helps to define the DAO’s long-term vision, then the SOS allows Arbitrum DAO to chart the course to get there.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal can be considered to have two distinct phases. The first phase comprises a ~14-day forum review, feedback, and edit period after which the SOS framework will move to the 7-day offchain voting period. If passed, Entropy will consider the structure of the SOS accepted by the DAO, and the second phase will be initiated. In phase two, contributors will submit their strategic objectives matrices with one matrix finally chosen through a Snapshot vote. The periods making up the second phase are described below.\n\n## Notice Period (14 days)\n\nAt the beginning of the 14-day notice period, announcements will be made on the forum and all the other relevant communication channels (e.g., Twitter, Telegram, etc.), giving delegates and contributors enough time to prepare for the upcoming submission period. This announcement will include:\n\n1. The expected start and end dates of all the subsequent periods (submission, feedback, and revision).\n2. Guidelines on how to submit a proposed set of short- and medium-term objectives as well as related key results.\n3. Link to an open channel through which anyone can submit one-off objectives and related key results for consideration by those looking to develop a full-fledged objectives matrix submission.\n4. Link to an FAQ forum thread where delegates can ask questions about the program.\n\nEntropy Advisors will facilitate the end-to-end process in cooperation with the Arbitrum Foundation and any other relevant parties.\n\n## Submission Period (30 days)\n\nThis submission period lasts 30 days, during which delegates and contributors are invited to make their submissions. Those interested in participating will have to create a forum post under a designated Strategic Objective Setting (SOS) subcategory. The goal-setting methodology utilized will be the Objectives and Key Results framework, where each objective (high-level, inspirational goal) is accompanied by key results (specific, measurable outcomes) that once reached, represent an objective having been completed. As a reminder, these objectives should indisputably align with the DAO’s mission, vision, and purpose. At a minimum, a valid submission must include the following information:\n\n1. View of Arbitrum’s current state and what its strengths/weaknesses are\n2. Short-term objectives (1 year)\n3. Mid-term objectives (2 years)\n5. Key results, i.e., measurable success metrics, for all objectives\n6. Risks connected to all objectives\n7. High-level estimates of non-capital resources needed for each objective\n8. Rationale explaining how the objectives align with Arbitrum’s MVP and why they were chosen given Arbitrum’s current state\n\nThe format for a SOS submission post on the forum is as follows (note, while the Title and headers should follow the below format, the information under each header is up to the author; this is a non-exhaustive list):\n\n* Title\n  * Format: [SOS Submission] {Delegate} – Strategic Objectives\n  * Example: [SOS Submission] Entropy Advisors – Strategic Objectives\n* Summary\n  * A brief summary of the strategic objectives\n  * High-level explanation of their impact on Arbitrum.\n  * Main focus areas for each proposed objective (i.e., Stylus, Orbit, Gaming, etc.)\n* Rationale\n  * A general overview of Arbitrum’s current state, including where the author sees the ecosystem’s strengths and weaknesses.\n  * Explanation of how these objectives are aligned with Arbitrum’s MVP, why they were chosen given Arbitrum’s current state, and what risks, required non-capital resources, and expected outcomes are related to the objectives.\n  * Key assumptions and strategic reasoning behind chosen objectives.\n* 1-Year Strategic Objectives & Key Results\n  * A clear and specific statement of each objective.\n  * ~2-5 measurable key results/success metrics per objective.\n\n* 2-Year Strategic Objectives & Key Results\n  * Same format as 1-year strategic objectives.\n* Further Details\n  * Anything else the author feels as though relevant to include in their submission.\n\n### Condensed Example of a 2-Year Strategic Objective (figures are illustrative):\n\nObjective: Arbitrum becomes the indisputable leader within a selection of onchain finance-related verticals: stablecoins, RWAs, and lending.\n\nAlignment with the MVP: As onchain finance-related verticals continue to grow in usage, importance, and impact, it is imperative for Arbitrum to achieve a market-leading position in a certain set of these sectors. Doing so ensures that the ecosystem stays aligned with its vision of being the home for the universal shift onchain, with Arbitrum rollups as the first stop in crypto for users and the default platform for developers.\n\nKey Result 1: Arbitrum One becomes the second largest blockchain in terms of stablecoin volume traded on onchain exchanges.\n\nKey Result 2: RWAs (excluding stablecoins) held within the Arbitrum ecosystem grow by 20x from when the DAO chooses its set of objectives.\n\nKey Result 3: The Arbitrum ecosystem reaches a 30% market share of all outstanding onchain loans.\n\nWhile the number of strategic objectives in a matrix is not limited, proposers should consider the DAO’s capacity to effectively focus on multiple areas simultaneously. Moreover, while the objectives should be aspirational, they must also be attainable. When providing feedback or choosing a specific objective matrix, we encourage delegates to evaluate their feasibility critically. Implementing unrealistic objectives and key results would most likely result in wasted efforts and be counterproductive.\n\nA given year’s objectives are expected to be limited to a specific focus area and not to overlap with each other. As such, we recommend submitters refrain from proposing objectives that are too high level since the potential for overlap increases. Having said that, the sets of 1- and 2-year objectives can be the same as long as key results across years are different.\n\nSee this example from [Hasu’s proposed goals for Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/hasus-goose-submission-proposed-goals-for-lido-dao-to-consider/5590). When objectives form a cohesive, well-documented strategy, it is more likely to gain support from delegates. Just giving the DAO a list of objectives likely will not be sufficient; the expectation is for the objectives to make up a holistic strategy with a well-reasoned rationale.\n\n## Feedback period (21 days)\n\nOnce the submission period is over, no new objective matrices can be put forward. The submission period is followed by a 21-day feedback period. During this time, submitters are prohibited from making changes to their submissions to allow delegates to examine each submission, provide feedback, and propose edits. This period ensures that all delegates have ample time to familiarize themselves with each submission and that everyone is commenting on the same submission versions.\n\n## Revision Period (14 days)\n\nDuring the revision period, submitters may amend their objective matrices based on community feedback if they wish to do so. Apart from making edits, this period enables submitters to merge their proposals with others, mixing and matching objectives across submissions (note that a given year’s objectives should still have no overlap). If two or more proposals are merged, proposers should post the final version as a new submission in the SOS subcategory and modify the original submissions’ titles to indicate that they have been merged as well as include a link to the merged version at the top of the original submissions. If a proposer feels as though their objectives and key results are already adequately covered by another submission, they are also free to withdraw their submission during the revision period. At the end of the revision period, submissions will be locked and considered as the final versions, which will be the ones put up for a Snapshot vote to choose the DAO’s strategic objectives matrix.\n\n## Voting period (7 days)\n\nFinally, the voting period. Entropy will be in charge of creating a Snapshot vote with a list containing all finalized strategic objective matrices in a single proposal, with delegates voting on which matrix they are the most aligned with and see as optimal. The Snapshot will utilize single-choice voting with an option to abstain. Quorum is reached when at least 3% of all votable tokens have participated in the Snapshot, with the option that has received the most votes being implemented. A strategic objectives matrix proposer is free to vote on their own submission.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, delegates will vote on standalone matrices formed by sets of 1- and 2-year objectives and key results. Please note that if there is a vast amount of submissions going to a Snapshot vote, Entropy reserves the right to postpone the initiation of the vote following the revision period to ensure that delegates are given some additional time to examine the final versions of submissions. If there is any confusion in navigating the forum throughout this process, e.g., where to post, how to title posts, how to merge proposals with another author/similar proposal, etc., Entropy Advisors will be available to answer any questions from the community.\n\n## Review Phase & Ad Hoc Strategic Objective Adjustments\n\nAfter the initial strategic objectives matrices are defined and one has been chosen, the DAO is encouraged to review the chosen matrix on a yearly basis. This ensures the objectives and their key results remain relevant and aligned with the DAO’s evolving needs and the overall market dynamics. The process is similar to the second phase described earlier, but delegates can propose to modify existing objectives/key results, add new ones, or remove those that are no longer relevant.\n\nA review phase should be initiated 12 months after the previous voting period has ended. Ideally, OpCo has already been operationalized by then, meaning that the DAO can instruct the entity to manage the review phase. As stated earlier, we propose that the research member of the ARDC is initially tasked with providing quarterly reports assessing how the DAO has progressed with respect to its strategic objectives. Once OpCo is operationalized, this responsibility could also be transferred to the entity if the DAO chooses to do so.\n\nThe review phase is initiated by passing a Snapshot vote. In the proposal, the proposer must define who is in charge of managing the review phase. Given the review phase Snapshot vote passes, there will be a 14-day notice period. This will consist of a forum post updating delegates on the current state of the strategic objectives and informing them on what this review phase consists of. Among other things, this forum post should include:\n\n1. A summary of the strategic objectives and how successful the DAO has been with respect to fulfilling them.\n2. The expected start and end dates of all the subsequent periods.\n3. Guidelines on how to submit an amendment.\n4. Link to a FAQ forum thread where delegates can submit questions about the program.\n\nAfter the notice period, delegates are invited to submit amendments to the initially chosen strategic objectives matrix during a 30-day submission period. Amendments are not limited to simply modifying strategic objectives and key results. They can also involve removing, adding, or replacing specific objectives and associated key results.\n\nOnce the submission period ends, amendment submissions go through a 21-day feedback period during which no changes can be made to the submissions. Finally, a 14-day revision period will take place during which proposers can make edits to their proposed matrices and merge them with other proposed matrices before being locked and put up for a Snapshot vote to choose the new objective matrix. If no amendment submissions are made, there is no need to move to the feedback, revision, or voting periods, and the old objectives matrix will remain effective.\n\nNote that the review phase timeline given above can be modified at the discretion of the review phase proposer depending on the number of submissions made.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the SOS review phase should be conducted annually, with each cycle beginning 12 months after the conclusion of the previous voting period. However, if there's a pressing need to review the strategic objectives due to, e.g., changes in the market environment, competitive space, or the DAO’s financials, a delegate can create a forum post outlining extensive reasoning for ad hoc adjustments accompanied by the proposed strategic objectives and related key results. Allowing for at least one week for discussion, the forum post will then be put up for a Snapshot vote utilizing single-choice voting with the options of adopting the proposed objectives and key results, initiating a fast-tracked review phase with a similar structure as described above (again, the proposer has to define who is managing this phase), and leaving the current objectives and key results unchanged.\n\nIt’s important to note that a well-structured strategy objectives matrix **should not be expected to be changed frequently**. As such, a proposed ad hoc adjustment must be extremely rigorously argumented and only take place if most of the previous strategic objectives have been reached or given unprecedented/emergency circumstances. Moreover, delegates ought to be highly critical when such adjustments are proposed. For example, the proposer simply stating that they disagree with the current objectives should not be a strong enough reason to modify the objectives.\n\nIf an objectives matrix is changed on an ad hoc basis, the originally scheduled review phase will be pushed back. This phase should only be initiated once 12 months have elapsed since the previous vote to change the DAO’s strategic objectives and related key results has passed.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO’s strategic objectives and related key results can be removed by creating a forum post explaining the reasoning to do so. Allowing for at least one week for discussion, the post will be moved to a single-choice Snapshot vote with the voting options “For”, “Against”, and “Abstain”, requiring a simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain” for the proposal to pass.\n\nPreviously chosen, not yet achieved objectives and related key results will remain active during a Review/Ad Hoc Strategic Objective Adjustments Phase to ensure the continuity of the DAO's strategic direction, replaced only once a new objectives matrix has been selected through a dedicated voting process. I.e., unless the DAO votes to remove its objectives, the continuity of the SOS is ensured.\n\n# Timeline\n\n* First Phase (Ratification of the SOS Framework):\n  * Review, Feedback, & Edit Period: January 10th - January 23rd\n  * Snapshot Period: January 23rd - January 30th\n* Second Phase (Ratification of a Strategic Objectives Matrix):\n  * Notice Period: 14 days (note that this period's initiation might be pushed back slightly such that submitters will have more time to include possible takeaways from ETHDenver into their matrices during the Submission Period) \n  * Submission Period: 30 days\n  * Feedback Period: 21 days\n  * Revision Period: 14 days\n  * Voting Period: 7 days\n* Review Phase (Potential Amendments to the Strategic Objectives Matrix): Initiated 12 months after the previous voting period has ended or as a result of an ad hoc adjustments proposal as described above.\n\n*Note that any of the time periods in the first and second phases can be shortened/extended at Entropy’s discretion depending on the number of submissions received.*",

        "body": "**Timeline of Updates:**\n\n*Oct 24 - MVP posted*\n*Oct 30 - Mission statement updated*\n*Nov 1 - Proposal put on hold while seeking final feedback.*\n*Dec 9 - Purpose statement updated.*\n*Dec 12 - Will proceed to Snapshot.*\n\n## Non-Constitutional\n\n## Abstract\n\nFollowing extensive conversations with stakeholders and active delegates, and feedback on our initial mission/vision/goals [proposal](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-dao-s-vision-mission-and-goals/26537), Entropy Advisors has decided to modify our approach for aligning the Arbitrum DAO on its end state goals and the more granular strategy through which these will be reached. This approach can be distilled into three separate phases:\n\n1. Achieving wide-reaching agreement on why the Arbitrum DAO exists and what it is trying to accomplish. In other words, what is the Arbitrum DAO’s mission, vision, and purpose. The MVP is purposefully simple and unambiguous such that it is absolutely clear what the DAO is ultimately working towards, with additional complexity only introduced when strategic goals to reach the end state are created. Without an agreed upon north star, it is impossible to evaluate how one-off strategies and initiatives assist the DAO to reach its goals, simply because there is currently a wide set of different opinions on what the DAO is striving to achieve. Additionally, most—if not all—initiatives and strategies are evaluated in isolation without considering how they play into wider frameworks. While the MVP might feel too abstract, its purpose is to enable more complexity to be stacked on top of it through iterative efforts.\n\n2. Once the DAO’s end state goals have been solidified, anyone will have the opportunity to propose a strategy matrix made up of 12- and 24-month focus areas for the DAO through an open process named Strategic Objective Setting (SOS). These areas should have well-established guidelines for tangible implementation and what they aim to accomplish, as well as only have one purpose—optimally moving the DAO towards its end state. This is the step that will allow the DAO to refocus its attention on the most critical deliverables and judge how one-off initiatives fit into its short- to medium-term priorities. Entropy Advisors is working on the SOS proposal in tandem with the MVP, and it will be posted as a subsequent separate proposal with the DAO choosing one matrix of strategies as the winner.\n\n3. Combined with financial forecasting, the SOS will enable the DAO to budget itself for the next 12/24 months by earmarking capital to each strategic focus area ratified in step 2. Arguably, the most important aspect of this step is for the DAO to align on how profitable/loss-making it wants to be during the coming year(s). Lastly, with clearly defined strategic focus areas, it should also become simpler for the DAO to begin marketing its efforts since, e.g., a clear identity, as well as narratives, can be built around each of the DAO’s focus areas.\n\n![MVP image 1.png](ipfs://bafkreihzcndqv6am5ba2uqx3nnecirushrkktinzlbrqkn46spaxu3767i)\n\nWhen it comes to this proposal, we’ve strived to distill numerous key stakeholders’ and delegates’ thoughts and ideas into a cohesive mission, vision, and purpose for the Arbitrum DAO, presented below. It’ll naturally be impossible to align all DAO participants on the DAO’s end state goals because of the ecosystem’s diversity. However, for this exercise to be successful, the passed Mission, Vision, and Purpose must have buy-in from a clear majority of the DAO and cannot be unilaterally pushed forward.\n\nAfter looking into other ecosystems, we concluded that [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/the-guided-open-objective-setting-exercise-goose-proposal-a-genesis-step-to-jump-start-a-dao-wide-goal-setting-exercise-and-cadence/5355) currently has the best-suited mechanism to strategically define objectives in a decentralized and efficient manner, which is why we are striving to implement a program for Arbitrum that takes influence from Lido. We thank Lido DAO contributors who set a great example of how decentralized governance should go about this exercise.\n\n## Call to Action\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO’s Guiding Principles are as Follows:\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum ecosystem. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\n![MVP Image 2.png](ipfs://bafybeieolo4gzttjfxjoa3rv5werhlpfdo36cagyniy7jqzhbcbmcizkci)\n\n\n## Motivation + Rationale\n\nThe current lack of defined mission, vision, purpose, and strategic objectives today has created a notable, twofold inefficiency in the DAO:\n\n1. Each organization operating in the DAO must extrapolate for itself what it should work towards that contributes the most value to Arbitrum. Questions arise such as:\n* Should my organization work toward enabling operational sustainability and painting a picture of ARB as a productive asset?\n* Growth of the technology stack:\n    i. Orbit?\n    ii. Stylus?\n    iii. Arbitrum One?\n* What role should public goods have within Arbitrum?\n\nWith a lack of clear strategic focus areas, being an effective DAO operator becomes difficult. Redundant and conflicting work turn into a reality due to a lack of alignment and organizational structure.\n\n2. The absence of concrete goals has made it challenging for the DAO to judge the effectiveness of initiatives. A system has been created where all the DAO can effectively do is judge “Did this organization work hard” but lacks the ability to judge “Did this organization do a good job moving Arbitrum forward towards its end state goals.”\n\nAdditionally, a clear vision is required for the DAO to pursue its own brand and marketing strategies. It is time to align on this vision. If Arbitrum DAO executes its mission successfully, what does Arbitrum’s place in the world look like? What are the ecosystem and its numerous contributors (the DAO and its programs, the Foundation, and development teams) working towards? What sets Arbitrum apart from competitors?\n\nThe goal of the MVP proposal is to align the DAO on the highest level of purpose, enabling the subsequent SOS to build on top of it and function as a framework through which delegates and key stakeholders can propose and choose a set of concrete short- and mid-term goals for Arbitrum DAO. This approach helps ease Entropy's concerns with our [initial approach](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/unifying-arbitrum-dao-s-vision-mission-and-goals/26537), where the proposal promised everything under the sun as it continually expanded with more (and sometimes conflicting) opinions into the mix. Additionally, we believe our original desire to set out on a 5-year plan left too much room for ambiguity without tangible steps to be taken.\n\nThus, the scope has been reduced. Even within the objectively high-level MVP proposal herein, there are still likely to be areas of contention, such as whether Arbitrum should align with Ethereum more closely, whether the DAO should put a greater emphasis on its flagship Arbitrum One product, and whether the delegates will actually feel empowered to use the MVP as a driving force for their actions.\n\nThe MVP will be the foundation for most actions taken by the Arbitrum DAO going forward, especially when it comes to short- to medium-term strategy setting and budgeting. It is a document that will help drive the DAO, protocol, token, and ecosystem into the foreseeable future and directly inform decisions surrounding new proposals and initiatives.\n\n## Diving In\n\n### Purpose (Meaning): Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem. \n\nDriving Question: Why does Arbitrum DAO exist?\n\n* Why is Arbitrum DAO developing all of the products and initiatives with the design decisions it is?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO’s purpose is to **Defend and guide the Arbitrum Ecosystem.**\n\nArbitrum is not just scaling tech, it scales L1s without concessions to censorship resistance, accessibility, decentralization, or security. A crucial component of the DAO’s existence is to defend these ideals. For its governed chains, Arbitrum DAO ensures that there is no single point of control, can eliminate rent-seeking intermediaries, and most importantly, users maintain control of their assets without trusting an entity. In order to defend Arbitrum into perpetuity, the DAO requires sustainable operations and funding mechanisms, which will be further expanded on in the Vision section below. \n\nAccording to the [blockchain trilemma](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/vision/), to scale and accommodate more throughput and users, L1s require trade-offs in terms of either security or decentralization. Making concessions to decentralization or security is not an option for Ethereum mainnet, leading to a chain that even with today’s limited number of onchain participants becomes prohibitively expensive for most users. Arbitrum DAO’s purpose, true to Vitalik’s [rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698), is to scale L1s while defending security and decentralization. \n\nThe second portion of Arbitrum DAO’s purpose is to guide the ecosystem. Guiding the Arbitrum ecosystem refers to every aspect of what Arbitrum offers, whether it be Arbitrum One, Orbit’s ecosystem of chains, or DAO-funded programs. At a high level, guiding encompasses two areas: growing and stewarding. Growing Arbitrum One is achieved by creating the best environment for builders, supporting their apps, bringing in more users and awareness to the value One provides, and ensuring alignment between builders and Arbitrum DAO. The same applies to Arbitrum’s Orbit chains. Sustainable growth is at the core of Arbitrum DAO’s purpose, and the DAO should view its role with respect to growth from a lens of continuing for 100s if not 1000s of years.\n\nStewarding the ecosystem relies on guiding the path forward for Arbitrum upgrades, new products, and funding decisions. In the world of Arbitrum, the DAO is in control, and that means making informed decisions that optimally move the ecosystem forward in an unceasing and durable way. The DAO is in charge of calling the shots for the future of Arbitrum. \n\n### Mission (Action): Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.\n\nDriving Question: What is Arbitrum DAO doing to achieve its purpose?\n\n* What activities is it executing in practice that lead to its reason for existence being achieved?\n\nAnswer: Arbitrum DAO’s mission is to **Empower people with the freedom to build their best onchain world.**\n\nArbitrum DAO’s mission is to empower people with the sovereignty to build what they want, code in their preferred language, execute without barriers, and create without needing permission—embracing true onchain freedom. However, building one's best onchain world does not just apply to developers, but equally to users, creators, and DAO contributors.\n\nArbitrum gives builders the freedom to develop on their own terms. “Your chain, Your rules.” This includes, among other things, allowing for self-governed rollups (not forcing ARB into the design) and supporting multiple languages. Arbitrum stands out in being the best and most robust scaling tech, but also in forward-thinking design decisions that enable it to be the primary home for builders by giving freedom and flexibility to its development community.\n\nThe most important aspect of enabling the best onchain world is achieved through Arbitrum continuing to build a full-featured tech stack that includes battle-tested permissionless proving, forced inclusion, custom gas tokens, multi-language support, interoperability, MEV solutions, and much more. True to its purpose, the best onchain world with Arbitrum has security at its core.\n\nEmpowering rollup and application developers to leverage the best-in-class technology stack without restrictions will establish network effects and, importantly, a unified narrative that ties together the rest of the ecosystem, creating an environment that attracts new builders across a wide set of verticals to Arbitrum. This in turn enables Arbitrum to be the primary destination for compelling blockspace, defined as a blockchain’s ability to attract users through the utility it provides. For a rollup to be compelling, it must have sought-after blockspace, which can only be achieved in one way: Attracting great apps. We don't just aim to create blockspace that maintains Ethereum's core values, we aim to create blockspace that people want to use. Attracting builders is one of the most crucial pieces to Arbitrum’s mission. While crypto has many amazing apps, compelling blockspace is the key that will enable crypto to break into magnitudes more users in the future. Today, Arbitrum One is the most compelling rollup in crypto and the DAO’s flagship product, and that is an achievement we must continue to support at all costs. That said we must not lose sight that on a long time horizon, the ecosystem will also expand through complimentary Orbit chains.\n\nWhen it comes to end-users, creators, and DAO contributors, Arbitrum DAO’s mission to empower people with freedom can be quantified in two notable ways:\n1. Being part of a wider, resonating collective movement generates a certain degree of loyalty, excitement, and alignment that is difficult to quantify, yet crucial in driving long-term, sustained engagement and new contributions.\n2. Freedom is attributed to the ability to pick and choose from a wide selection of applications and infrastructure-level solutions, creating a package of services tailored to specific requirements. Arbitrum offers flexibility to meet diverse priorities and utility functions—whether users value security, privacy, low costs, etc., the ecosystem adapts to support them all. Arbitrum is building to be the one-stop shop where end users, creators, and DAO contributors are equipped to effortlessly perform anything that’s achievable on a blockchain without constraints.\n\nIn order to reach the aforementioned goals, it is of the utmost importance that Arbitrum DAO runs sustainable operations with revenue. Without sustainability, it will be impossible for the DAO to continue supporting the building out of the best scaling tech, pushing forward an ecosystem attracting the best builders, and providing end users, creators, and DAO contributors with an empowering, collaborative, and personalized environment. A pivotal part of Arbitrum DAO’s mission is ensuring that all highly adopted Arbitrum-based rollups and apps create revenue for the DAO, maintaining alignment between the ecosystem and token.\n\n### Vision (Aspiration): Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.\n\nDriving Question: What is the end state goal for Arbitrum that the DAO is striving to achieve?\n\n* Where is Arbitrum’s place in the world after the DAO achieves all it has set out to do?\n\nAnswer: **Arbitrum is home to the universal shift onchain.**\n\nWith the most full-featured tech stack and compelling (sought-after) blockspace in crypto on Arbitrum stack rollups, users and builders from all walks of life and verticals will have flocked into the Arbitrum ecosystem. New users’ first onboarding experience in crypto will be through an Arbitrum rollup, while the default choice for developers will be to deploy on an Arbitrum technology stack-enabled chain. In a world where financial transactions happen onchain, the majority will take place on Arbitrum blockspace.\n\nArbitrum DAO will function as a resilient flywheel. The best tech stack together with robust ecosystem support will increasingly attract builders and notable enterprises who create and enable applications that onboard more users into the ecosystem. Profits accruing to the DAO from users leveraging Arbitrum’s blockspace will bolster network security and also be reinvested in a sustainable and diversified manner. Sequencing and licensing fees will be reinforced by acquiring ownership interests that help expand the ecosystem (intangible) and enable value accrual (tangible). The DAO will function with some similarities to a conglomerate, leveraging investments to create an even more robust application and infrastructure layer, directly strengthening its core product, which again will produce increasing returns that can be used to strengthen network security through ARB and to support new growth.\n\n![MVP Image 3.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeie47gxhymgnzlpwh5p7v24s6fhwlbc3ai3dff7jcbykkadfn2jema)\n## Concluding Thoughts\n\nIt took multiple months of conversations with stakeholders to really get a sense of Arbitrum DAO’s future but Entropy Advisors is very happy with the potential for this new process. While much of this proposal is not directly actionable, we believe that it is the necessary first step in moving forward with Arbitrum DAO’s future strategic plans. We look forward to making final modifications to the MVP based on the DAO’s feedback. It is worth noting that it is not possible for the MVP to serve everyone's desires because it would end up with contradictions, but it’s important that it is a document that the DAO can get behind and feel empowered to use.\n\nThe subsequent SOS (Strategic Objective Setting) proposal will be the next step in this exercise, in which anyone will be able to create 12- and 24-month actionable strategic goals for the DAO. The SOS will be posted shortly after the MVP. If approved, it will include a 14-day notice period and 30-day submission window, in which any contributor can submit a strategy matrix of concrete strategic objectives aligned with the MVP. These workstreams could then be budgeted, creating a new paradigm for operational structure in the DAO.\n\n## Expected Timeline\n\n1. Dec 9th: final version of MVP forum period requesting comments and time to edit the proposal with delegate/broader community suggestions. Will be extended if necessary.\n3. Dec 12th: Snapshot to signal approval/disapproval/abstention of MVP (simple majority with at least 3% of all votable tokens voting either “For” or “Abstain”).\n4. Late Dec / Early Jan: SOS posted\n5. Entropy Advisors plans to take the MVP to a constitutional vote, adding it as language to the constitution, after a 6-month trial period. During the initial 6 months, changes can be made to the MVP via a proposal+Snapshot vote, but after being included in the constitution, would require a constitutional onchain amendment. It is our belief that the current MVP is broad enough to handle substantial changes in the crypto market.\n\nA huge thank you to @castlecapital, @maxlomu, and all the other contributors who dedicated considerable time and effort to provide us with valuable feedback on this exercise.",

        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThe Arbitrum DAO has allocated over 422m ARB tokens across various initiatives, including incentive programs, grants, investment vehicles, and service providers, amounting to a total spend in the nine-figure USD range. While these allocations have driven significant growth and innovation, there has been minimal oversight or review of how these funds are ultimately used, and no system currently exists to incentivize the identification and reporting of fund misappropriation. Although three instances of misuse have been uncovered, it is likely that additional cases remain undetected.\n\nIn response, Entropy Advisors proposes the **establishment of a grant misuse bounty program dubbed “The Watchdog”** to incentivize the identification and reporting of misused DAO-allocated funds. The program would utilize an incentive mechanism to reward community contributors and investigators who submit verifiable reports of misappropriation. If the proposal passes a temperature check, Entropy will manage a selection process to determine a suitable platform to host the Watchdog program.\n\n## Motivation and Rationale\n\nBy offering financial rewards for valid reports of misappropriation, there will be a stronger motivation for community members to contribute skills or information that aid in identifying misconduct in the DAO. Today, the identification of wrongdoing can result in retaliation, unnecessary friction within the DAO, and other negative externalities for the investigators. Moreover, with no incentive to bring forth allegations, it is unlikely that most community members would do so. The Watchdog program creates a decentralized force of accountability, augmenting the DAO’s capacity to detect abuse that would likely otherwise go unnoticed while protecting the submitter from repercussions.\n\nArbitrum DAO’s successful identification of misappropriated funds, whether by a service provider, protocol, grant recipient, or anyone else that receives funds from Arbitrum DAO has two large benefits:\n\n1. The DAO (mainly through the Foundation, as it has done so in the [past](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/stip-announcement-multisig-returns-leftover-funds/26383)) may be able to recapture some of the funds. This could involve legal avenues, smart contract enforcement (clawbacks / stream stopping), or community pressure.\n2. The evidence can be used to identify possible improvement opportunities in the underlying programs and make more informed decisions surrounding the recognized bad actors in the future.\n\nOther benefits include a mechanism for malicious action deterrence and bringing sophisticated onchain sleuths into the DAO.\n\nJust the existence of a transparent and well-publicized bounty program will likely deter some malicious actors from misusing DAO funds in the first place. Knowing that the community has the tools and incentives to identify misallocation increases the risk of exposure for those who might consider abusing the DAO’s trust. Recipients of DAO funds will need to think twice before acting maliciously or in a way that doesn’t align with the DAO’s strategic objectives, rules, and the broader interests of Arbitrum.\n\nBy allowing anyone to submit evidence-based reports of misuse anonymously, the program empowers the entire Arbitrum and crypto ecosystem to take an active role in maintaining the financial health and integrity of the Arbitrum DAO. We hope this fosters a culture of vigilance, good intentions, and accountability while bringing white-hat actors into the ecosystem.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Watchdog program will extend to ALL DAO-funded initiatives including end recipients of other programs such as the Questbook Domain program, Stylus Sprint, Arbitrum Foundation grants, and the incentives programs. The process for rewarding those who successfully identify fund misuse will start with a temporary solution utilizing a small committee of reviewers with a long-term plan for the program to eventually fall under OpCo, if and when it is stood up.\n\nEntropy proposes the following definition of misuse of funds:\n\n*Any action or inaction by a recipient of DAO-allocated funds that directly violates the stated terms, objectives, agreement, or overall spirit of the allocation under which those funds were provided.*\n\nMisuse definitions and examples below are included solely as a point of reference for the DAO and all decisions surrounding severity will be at the full discretion of the committee:\n\n* **Low:** Cases where there is minor misuse of DAO-allocated funds with limited impact on the DAO’s overall financial health, reputation, or strategic goals.\n  * Example: A Questbook domain allocator accidentally sent a double payment for a milestone and the recipient did not report it.\n  * Example: A grant recipient uses a portion of the funds for unauthorized purposes, such as non-DAO-aligned marketing, travel, or administrative overhead not included in the grant proposal.\n* **Medium:** Cases involving significant misuse of DAO-allocated funds that impact the DAO’s resources or strategic goals, but where the misuse is still recoverable, or partial results have been delivered.\n  * Example: An incentive program recipient uses funds in a way that does not benefit end users, but is a step away from outright theft and fraud.\n  * Example: A grant recipient diverts a significant portion of the funds (e.g., 50k+ ARB) to unrelated projects or personal use.\n* **High:** Cases involving large-scale, deliberate misuse of DAO-allocated funds.\n  * Example: A fund-recipient fabricates deliverables to obtain funds without working on the approved project, then disappears with the entire grant.\n  * Example 2: Theft or unauthorized transfers, such as if MSS members purposefully diverted funds to a recipient not eligible.\n\nThe workflow for Watchdog reports will be as follows:\n\n**1. Report Submission**\n\n* Anyone (watchers) can identify potential misuse of funds that originated from the DAO and submit an evidence-based report to a designated section on a to-be-determined bounty platform. Throughout the entire process, the identity of the submitter will remain private. As detailed further in step 3, the report will only be made public to the DAO in the instance that attempts at backchannel communications with the alleged party fail and a DAO ban is constituted or on a case-by-case basis where the committee deems it prudent to make the DAO aware of the misuse.\n* Reports will follow a standard template to help streamline the review process and collect the initial necessary information.\n\n**2. Review Process**\n\n* A whitelisted group of three DAO-associated reviewers will have the ability to review the submitted reports. We propose the group of initial reviewers to comprise the Arbitrum Foundation, Entropy Advisors, and the elected Research Member of the ARDC. This structure minimizes the operating costs of the program until OpCo is stood up., Entropy and the Arbitrum Foundation will be waiving payment as reviewers. The ARDC Research Member will be paid at their stated hourly rate, with funds coming from the ARDC V2 budget. We anticipate the review process for a Watchdog report to take a minimal amount of hours.\n* The three reviewers will discuss reports and, if required, contact the concerned party for clarifications. If two or more reviewers agree (at their discretion) that the submission is based on substance and misuse has occurred, the watcher(s) will receive the bounty. The reviewers will also determine the level of severity of the misuse (Low, Medium, High), which will impact the bounty reward as outlined in step 4.\n* In the case that 2 or more reviewers deem there has been fund misuse, the Arbitrum Foundation will open up private channels of communication with the concerned party and attempt to get the funds back for the DAO.\n* Reviewers are required to abstain from specific review processes if a conflict of interest (COI) is identified. If two or more reviewers have an identified COI, the reviewers will identify two external parties who don’t have COIs and have the capabilities to review the report. If the report is made public, the reviewers’ identified COIs will be published at the same time. To reduce the need for an additional election process and budgeted compensation, Entropy suggests utilizing the soon-to-be-elected Domain Allocators from the D.A.O. program, MSS members, and the other ARDC V2 members for the short list of trusted community members to step in if multiple COIs exist.\n\n**3. DAO Forum & Snapshot Voting**\n\n* If all attempts at backchanneling are failed, the report will be posted to the forum with all the watcher’s personal and identifiable information redacted in the version posted publicly. On a case by case basis, the committee may decide to post a summary of the report to inform the DAO of the misuse. Otherwise individual reports will not be posted to the forum directly. It is Entropy’s belief that in instances of low misuse, it is unwise to subject teams to public scrutiny for what could be a common or minor error.\n* The DAO will vote via Snapshot on whether or not the violation constitutes a DAO ban. Delegates can reference the Furucombo [instance](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/potential-misuse-of-funds-furucombo/25496) as an example.\n* The Foundation will determine in which instance of legal recourse is viable. This will be dependent on the size of funds involved in the misuse and legal jurisdiction of the accused party.\n\n**4. Reward Mechanism**\n\n* If the review committee deems a report valid at their discretion, they will deem what level of misuse. A certain level of subjectivity has been introduced due to the wide range of programs that the Watchdog program will cover. A mix of factors will be taken into account the level of severity. These include, but are not limited to the total amount of funds involved, how the funds were used (ex. simple error or intentional fraud), if the misuse is rectifiable, and/or the level of damage to the Abitrum ecosystem/brand.\n  * **Low:** 1k ARB base payout + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $10k\n  * **Medium:** 10k ARB base payout + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $20k\n  * **High:** 30k ARB + 5% of recovered funds capped at an additional $100k\n* A fixed reward has been included to ensure that an incentive always exists for community members and individuals to submit reports. The base payouts denominated in ARB will come from the approved Watchdog budget.\n* If recaptured funds are denominated in a volatile asset, the maximum reward awarded to the watcher will be calculated as the 30D TWAP of the underlying asset on the day the transfer is made. For clarity, the reward is still paid out in the recovered asset.\n* While anyone is encouraged to submit reports, only watchers that complete a KYC with the Foundation will be eligible for rewards.\n* The program will run until the 400K ARB is exhausted from valid misuse reports. Once 100k ARB remains, a proposal will be put forward to the DAO to extend the budget or shut down the program.\n\nWe believe that this mechanism is optimal for the time being, but if/once OpCo is stood up, the program could be moved into its domain. If done so, the reviewer and voting mechanism would likely need to be restructured.\n\nThe expectation will be that 6 months post program launch, Entropy Advisors will raise a subsequent vote to the DAO in order to gauge the program's success. At this point the DAO can determine if the program should continue in its current state, be moved under OpCo if or when it is stood up, or if the program should be discontinued. Entropy will provide a retrospective report near the end of the 6-month trial to help the DAO evaluate the successfulness of the program. The report will summarize the received misuse cases along with data such as total amount of misuse, severity breakdowns, and amount of ARB recovered.\n\n### Steps to Implement: RFP Process\n\nIt will be necessary to create a secure platform where community members or contributors can privately submit their reports. This will ensure confidentiality and data security for all parties involved. With the requirements resembling a bug bounty program, we imagine that an existing platform can quickly build the necessary portal. If the proposal passes a temperature check, Entropy will directly contact potential providers and solicit bids that will be publicly posted in a dedicated subcategory in the forum. Delegates will have visibility into the bids, but Entropy will conduct negotiations, select the provider, and present a summary of the rationale to the DAO prior to the proposal moving to Tally. Unless the DAO feels strongly about being involved in the selection process, our team views this as the simplest and quickest route to choosing a provider. The Arbitrum Foundation will serve as the counterparty for the agreement.\n\nEntropy refrained from setting a maximum budget at this stage as to not publicly signal to interested providers what amount the DAO would be willing to pay. Additionally, depending on whether the portal needs to be built from scratch or simply added to an existing platform, the costs may vary greatly.\n\n## Budget\n\nIn total 400,000 ARB + the necessary amount of ARB for the selected bounty platform (determined by RFP process) will be sent to a new MSS multisig in order to facilitate the program.\n\n* 400,000 ARB available to reward valid Watchdog reports.\n* Amount of ARB necessary to build and host the Watchdog program. To be determined through a RFP process.\n\n## Timeline\n\nDecember 20th: Forum post\nJanuary 16th-23rd: Snapshot vote\nJanuary 24th : Procurement process begins\nTBD: Onchain Vote\nTBD: Program is launched\n\n## Voting Options\n\nWith the RFP process happening pre-Tally ratification, the Snapshot vote will be subjected to the non-constitutional quorum requirements of 3% of the votable token supply with a simple majority of votes in favor/abstain.\n\nIt will be a basic vote with FOR, AGAINST, and ABSTAIN as the three options.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nOutside of being placed as one of the three reviewers, Entropy does not have any other conflicts of interest to disclose as part of this proposal.",

    "summary": "The proposal to consolidate the Arbitrum DAO treasury management committees into a single Arbitrum Treasury Management Council is well supported by voters and forum participants. It addresses fragmentation, improves efficiency, and reduces overhead without additional costs. The council structure includes the OAT as a voting oversight body, Entropy Advisors as the execution treasurer, and the Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs as observatory bodies. While some concerns exist around concentration of power and service provider selection transparency, overall community sentiment is positive, valuing streamlined governance and clearer accountability. Historical similar proposals passed with strong support but sometimes had negative market impacts, informing cautious optimism. Current market impact during voting is positive.",
