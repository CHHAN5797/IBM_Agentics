This journey began with a complete UI and UX overhaul via the ZEN interface, reached a significant milestone with the launch of CoWAMM—a novel solution for LVR mitigation—and now culminates in Balancer v3, a comprehensive reengineering of the platform’s underlying technology.\n\nAs outlined by Fernando, in his post on the [protocol's future](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801), Balancer v3 strategically focuses on key priorities such as fungible liquidity, stablecoins, long-tail, and yield-bearing liquidity, and introduces new customizable options for extending existing pool types through hooks.\n\nAlongside these technical advancements, Balancer v3 provides a unique opportunity to refine the protocol’s core mechanics, particularly its fee structure and pool framework—critical elements for long-term DAO sustainability. The following temperature check proposes adjustments to the fee model and core pool framework, set to take effect with the release of Balancer v3.\n\n# Simplifying the Protocol Fee Model\n\n## Fee Model on Balancer v3\n\nThe development of custom pools provides the DAO with a unique opportunity to integrate innovative pool types and advanced mechanisms for fee accrual and redistribution.\n\nCurrently, a significant portion of Balancer v2's revenue is derived from a specialized fee-capture system on liquidity pools hosting yield-bearing assets like Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs) and Liquid Reward Tokens (LRTs). With the launch of 100% Boosted Pools in v3, this established yield-capture advantage will be extended, allowing revenue generation from vanilla, non-yield-bearing tokens by deploying them into yield-generating markets. This approach enables any token with an external yield market to be composed and “transformed” into a yield-bearing asset, unlocking new revenue streams for the DAO \\- **a system that no other DEX in DeFi has**.\n\nAlthough the technology has demonstrated its product-market fit for yield-bearing liquidity, the existing 50% yield-capture fee has faced resistance from LST protocols and liquidity providers, limiting the DAO’s ability to capture this market segment fully. Given the critical role of yield capture in revenue generation, the DAO must reassess the current fee model to remain competitive and dominate this market.\n\nThus, our strategic focus for v3 centers on accelerating the adoption of boosted pools and solidifying the DAO’s position within the LST and LRT market. Additionally, we aim to drive continuous product innovation to continue to unlock unique revenue streams through hooks and custom pool logic.\n\nTo support this, we propose implementing two key changes:\n\n1. Reducing yield fees to 10% to increase adoption of yield-bearing liquidity on Balancer v3  \n2. Strengthening veBAL holder benefits with a simplified fee model[^5]\n\nThe veBAL system and BAL token emissions, being immutably established in Balancer v2, will continue utilizing the core pool framework and gauge system. This ensures alignment between token emissions and performance while maintaining veBAL's long-term relevance. Importantly, veBAL holders will benefit from concurrent revenue streams from both v2 and v3.\n\n**Fee Structure Overview:**\n\n* 10% fees on yield-bearing asset yields  \n* 50% on collected swap fees\n\n**Pool Classifications:**\n\n* Core pools: as per new revised core pool framework  \n* Non-core pools: All other pools\n\n**Fee Distribution:**\n\n* Core pools: 70% voting incentives[^6], 12.5% veBAL, 17.5% DAO  \n* Non-core pools: 82.5% veBAL, 17.5% DAO\n\n \n![bip-734-1.png](ipfs://bafkreia3hmaxolni5kvj5kgryxa7jbaz7xoeqmprpeyq2huqnlktxscyay)\n    \n\nThis model achieves three key objectives:\n\n1. Streamline veBAL holder benefits through an 82.5% total fee share  \n2. Aligns BAL emissions with high-performing pools  \n3. Maintains sustainable DAO SP (service provider) funding and operations at 17.5% fee share.\n\n## Modified Fee Model on Balancer v2\n\nBalancer v2's success as a governance token, and LST / Yield Bearing liquidity hub in 2023-2024 informs our approach to fee model optimization. While preserving the core framework's integrity, we're proposing targeted adjustments to align with v3's launch:\n\n* Maintaining current fee rates: 50% yield fees, 50% swap fees  \n* Updating non-core pool fee distribution:  \n  * Previous: Redirected 50% of fees to voting incentives  \n  * New: 82.5% to veBAL, 17.5% to DAO  \n* Updating core pool fee distribution to be in line with v3:  \n  * 70% as voting incentives, 12.5% to veBAL, 17.5% to DAO\n\nThis modification serves to:\n\n* Sustain momentum in successful core pools  \n* Direct swap volume success to veBAL holders  \n* Encourage v3 migration through lower yield fees (10% on v3 vs 50% on v2)\n\n## Revised Core Pool Framework\n\nFor a pool to be eligible for core pool status, certain criteria must be met. We propose to make it more clear what will be a core pool in the future:\n\n### Composition requirements\n\n* Minimum 50% yield-bearing or boosted tokens for pool types such as weighted or composable stable pools  \n* 80/20 weighted pools that utilize Balancer as their primarily liquidity hub (e.g. RDNT:WETH 80/20 pool on Arbitrum). Protocols need to apply to core pool status for such pool types[^7]  \n* Must maintain a minimum $100k TVL\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\n* No yield fee exemption  \n* Fee settings delegated to Balancer governance  \n* If no protocol fee settings are present or managed by another entity, the pool can only become core pool if an alternative protocol fee setting is setup in place[^8]\n\n### Token Requirements\n\n* All tokens must have verified smart contracts  \n* No tokens with transfer restrictions or rebasing mechanics\n\n### Core Pool list maintenance\n\n* Core pool status is evaluated on a bi-weekly basis before fee sweeps by automated checks managed by Balancer Maxis \\[5\\]  \n* New pool types or compositions not described within this framework need governance approval to be added to the core pool list  \n* The DAO shall review this framework and propose adjustments through DAO governance\n\n## \n\n## Impact of Fee Change\n\nBased on the proposed fee changes, we have conducted [backtesting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dx82Hqcw53AwnXOkY3CFSJMshojjT7BzlsKf3zQa-FQ/edit?gid=759201376#gid=759201376) on v2 data and ran simulations to assess the potential impact of v3 adoption.\n\n### Balancer v2\n\nThe revised fee model adjustments to Balancer v2 would result in the following change in fee distribution to key stakeholders:\n\n* veBAL: increase of 46.7% of revenue share compared to the current model  \n* Voting incentives (to veBAL and vlAURA holders): 30.3% decrease  \n* DAO: no change\n\n \n![bip-734-2.png](ipfs://bafkreidvw3kwpd2kuvxti7yagbpfphiauagdgeqbvb7b2vl22r776ns6ji)\n    \n*Monthly fee distribution on v2: actual vs proposed (average of August, September and October 2024\\)*\n\n### Balancer v3\n\nWhile the reduction of yield fees from 50% to 10% in v3 represents a significant change, our analysis \\[1\\] demonstrates how optimized yield fee utilization will maintain robust protocol revenue. We conducted detailed simulations using 5 out of our top 10 pools by TVL, focusing on two key pool categories[^9]:\n\n1. Stable USD vs boosted stable pools on v3  \n2. Composable stable LST/LRT vs Aave or Morpho boosted pools\n\n \n![bip-734-3.png](ipfs://bafkreicxn2ivsa5txihwy7k7voxrj5bpr3wd2pzmlu2ykwz2n3o2d2ualy)\n    \n*Monthly income to liquidity providers comparing Balancer v2 vs v3*\n\n \n![bip-734-4.png](ipfs://bafkreiesnlfsj7gtn2tef44j2xvyaltt6qsvj7o45rfqfwruvkvprnxjse)\n    \n*Monthly yield fees to the fee collector*\n\nKey Findings:\n\n* LPs will experience a 407% increase in income from boosted yield and reduced yield fees  \n* Protocol yield fee revenue maintains 56% of current levels even with reduced yield fees  \n* Enhanced yield capture from new boosted stable pools effectively compensates for most of the yield fee reduction to 10% assuming the same TVL levels\n\nThis analysis shows that while yield fees are decreasing, the protocol's ability to capture and optimize yield fees through new pool types ensures sustainable revenue generation. The 407% increase in LP yield income demonstrates the effectiveness of this strategic shift toward yield optimization.\n\n## Launch timeline\n\nThe proposed Balancer v3 deployment schedule:\n\n* Q4 2024: Initial launch on Mainnet and Gnosis chain with strategic pool selection  \n* Q1 2025: veBAL gauge system activation with new fee model implementation  \n* Q1-Q2 2025: Multi-chain expansion phase\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nA detailed technical specification execution plan will be posted as a separate BIP outlining the modified fee collection mechanism on v2 and the implementation for v3 in early 2025\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThe launch of Balancer v3 marks a strategic evolution in the protocol’s development. It brings significant enhancements to custom pool creation and extends the flexibility of proven pool types while preserving the strong foundation and market leadership established with v2.\n\nBy refining the yield fee capture structure and streamlining core functionality, v3 is poised to deepen yield-bearing liquidity, boost returns for liquidity providers, increase benefits for veBAL holders, and foster sustainable long-term growth for the protocol.\n\nThis proposal strikes a balance between innovation and stability, setting the stage for Balancer’s continued leadership in DeFi infrastructure. We invite the community to support these enhancements as we embark on this exciting new chapter in Balancer’s journey.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1\\] [Fee distribution modeling](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dx82Hqcw53AwnXOkY3CFSJMshojjT7BzlsKf3zQa-FQ/edit?gid=759201376#gid=759201376)  \n\\[2\\] [Balancer v2 core pool framework](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/partner-onboarding/balancer-v2/core-pools.html)  \n\\[3\\] [Historical core pool dashboard](https://balancer.defilytica.com/#/corePools)  \n\\[4\\] [Protocol Fee Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/balancer/protocol-fees)  \n\\[5\\] Balancer v2: [Automatic core pool list](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/4cebcb436926c7c0098563f7b562d40f13494b95/outputs/core_pools.json#L2)\n\n[^1]:  As with v2 yield fee can be set to be exempt.

        "title": "[BIP-800] Deploy Balancer V3 on OP Mainnet",
        "author": "0x7019Be4E4eB74cA5F61224FeAf687d2b43998516",
        "body": "Hello everyone!\n\nIn my capacity as a Music Director at Beets (formerly Beethoven X), I am submitting the following BIP related to the deployment of Balancer v3 on OP Mainnet:\n\n### BIP-XXX: Deploy Balancer v3 on OP Mainnet, managed by Beets\n#### Introduction\nThis proposal seeks community endorsement for deploying Balancer v3 on OP Mainnet. OP Mainnet is a Layer 2 optimistic rollup scaling solution for Ethereum, designed to provide highly efficient transactions while inheriting the security of Ethereum Mainnet. With over $600m locked in DeFi, it is the fourth-largest roll-up solution by TVL. Committed to decentralization and open-source development, Optimism aims to build an internet that benefits all and is owned by all.\n\n\n#### Continuation of Joint Balancer / Beets Deployment on OP Mainnet with Balancer v3\nWith an infrastructure designed to streamline custom AMM development and provide users and DAOs with a continuously expanding tech stack, Balancer v3 is a cornerstone technology for any ecosystem. One standout product driving adoption is the newly optimized 100% Boosted Pools, which have gained instant traction among multiple DAOs. With established lending markets like Aave on Optimism and protocols already familiar with v2, deploying v3 on Optimism is a logical next step.\nFollowing the successful deployment of Balancer v2 on OP Mainnet, which Beets operated, the v3 deployment would also be managed by Beets. This new deployment builds on the strong collaboration between the Balancer and Beets DAOs, further strengthening their partnership and delivering mutual benefits to both ecosystems.\n\nThe main highlights of the Optimism deployment are the successful applications and management of the [Phase 1 grant](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-balancer-beethovenx/2658?u=ardocc) and the [LST/LRT grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7483023484917983). Phase 1 grant distribution is still on-going, with approximately 218k OP tokens left to be distributed from the total 500k tokens. The last update for the grant can be seen [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/ready-gf-phase-1-proposal-balancer-beethovenx/2658/41?u=ardocc). The LST/LRT grant concluded with all the milestones successfully completed, the final update is available as a comment under the [grant application](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-7483023484917983).\n\nThere’s definitely also been challenges. The boosted pools were a major part of the strategy and initial success of the deployment. Through the boosted pools incident in August 2023 there was a significant loss of TVL and revenue. This also slowed down the usage of Phase 1 grant, since the distribution was set to be matched 1:1 with revenue. [The latest grant application for increasing yield-bearing asset liquidity](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/balancer-yba-dex-liquidity-7241529389308983) was also effectively shut down even though it received the highest preliminary score out of all the applications. While it was not explicitly stated, during the discussion the main reason brought out was the unconcluded Phase 1 grant.\n\n#### Path Forward for Increasing TVL and Revenue\nThe plan forward has already been devised. With the approval of this proposal, Balancer v3 would be deployed on Optimism, which enables relaunching the boosted pools. Through discussion with the Optimism grant council we have been given assurance to post a proposal for repurposement of the currently undistributed Phase 1 grant funds. The repurposement proposal awaits for the successful vote of this proposal, with the main idea to support bootstrapping 100% boosted pools and incentivizing YBA liquidity on the v3 deployment in general. This is set to guarantee the successful launch of the v3 on Optimism and also enables applying for future Optimism grants.\n\n#### Optimism Deployment Fee Adjustment\nIn addition to the deployment of Balancer v3, this proposal also seeks to align with the updated Balancer fee model outlined in [BIP-734](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-734-balancer-v3-launch-and-protocol-enhancements/6168). Additionally, Optimism deployment would adopt the same Core Pool Framework as described in the updated Balancer fee model.\n\nThe most notable change is reducing Yield-Bearing fees from 50% to 10%. This adjustment aims to incentivize DAOs already utilizing v2 to transition to Boosted Pools on v3, while also appealing to protocols outside the Balancer ecosystem that were previously deterred by the 50% fee. By offering a pool type that provides additional rewards to users and enhances liquidity in two of DeFi’s most vital markets—DEXs and Lending Protocols—this change firmly positions Beets/Balancer as the leading destination for Yield-Bearing liquidity on Optimism.\n\nThis proposal proposes the following fee structure for the joint Optimism deployment:\n\nNew v3 deployment:\n\n* Protocol fees: 10% on yield-bearing asset yields, 50% on swaps.\n* Core pool fee distribution: 70% voting incentives, 15% Beets, 15% Balancer (6.25% veBAL, 8.75% DAO).\n* Non-core pool fee distribution: 50% Beets, 50% Balancer (41.25% veBAL, 8.75% DAO).\n\nExisting v2 deployment:\n\n* Protocol fees: 50% on yield-bearing asset yields, 50% on swaps.\n* Core pool fee distribution: 70% voting incentives, 15% Beets, 15% Balancer (6.25% veBAL, 8.75% DAO).\n* Non-core pool fee distribution: 50% Beets, 50% Balancer (41.25% veBAL, 8.75% DAO).\n\nRevenue going to Beets is decided based on Beets Quarterly Budget system, but Beets will adhere to continue using at least **50% of the revenue it gets from the Optimism joint deployment for veBAL/vlAURA acquisition** (pending Beets governance). This will ensure a significant part of Beets revenue will be used to continue empowering the Optimism deployment, by example Beets has been using a significant portion of its vlAURA voting power to drive emissions to USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool on Optimism without voting incentives.\n\n#### Motivation\n1. **Deploying Balancer v3 on Optimism as Core Infrastructure:**\nDeploying Balancer v3 on Optimism places it at the heart of one of the most dynamic and rapidly growing ecosystems in DeFi. This deployment strengthens Balancer’s position on OP Mainnet while solidifying its role as a foundational protocol for liquidity and automated market-making within the Superchain ecosystem.\n2. **Establishing Balancer as the Yield-Bearing Hub on Optimism:**\nWith the introduction of Balancer v3, the protocol is poised to become the premier destination for Yield-Bearing liquidity on Optimism. Balancer’s unique features will drive competitive yields for LPs while ensuring reliable pricing for assets. This strategic positioning will attract both existing DAOs and new protocols, establishing Balancer as the go-to platform for yield-bearing liquidity.\n3. **Continuation of Mutual Benefits for Joint Balancer / Beets Deployment:**\nThe successful joint Balancer / Beets deployment of Balancer v2 on Optimism has delivered mutual benefits. The launch of v3, with the updated protocol revenue model, is expected to continue driving increased attention, TVL, and fees for both ecosystems.\n4. **Bootstrapping Supported by Existing OP Grant:**\nApproximately 220k OP tokens remain from the OP Phase 1 grant, which will be repurposed to help bootstrap liquidity for Balancer v3 deployment.\n\n#### Specification\nThis proposal asks the Balancer community to authorize the deployment of Balancer v3 on OP Mainnet. In addition, a new protocol revenue structure would be adopted based on the updated Balancer fee model. Deployment is expected to start once the proposal has been approved.\n\n#### Conclusion\nDeploying Balancer v3 on Optimism and updating the protocol revenue structure represents a strategic opportunity to enhance both ecosystems by driving liquidity, user activity, and innovation. Approval of this proposal will facilitate the integration of Balancer v3 on OP Mainnet and adoption of the new fee model.",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1354\n\n# Introduction\n\nOver the last 6 months, the Maxis have transformed into a professional on-chain DevOps team, ensuring smooth operations of Balancer technology across chains as well as providing white-glove service to partners in the ecosystem. Our key success metrics are showcased by fast response times to partner requests and successful execution of many initiatives like supporting the launch of CoWAMM, the related incentive program, or the design and execution of token grants. Furthermore, we are constantly improving our technology stack with the ultimate goal of achieving self-service autonomy for most operations.\n\nGiven the Maxis are an integral part of Balancer technology and partner management, we aim to switch to bi-annual funding starting in Q4 2024. This provides us with more funding stability and also guarantees that resources for the upcoming Balancer v3 launch will be adequately allocated.\n\n# Initiatives\n\nAs with previous funding proposals, we want to make the most impact to Balancer DAO by working on key initiatives with clearly measurable objectives.\n\nAs context, you can refer to our last quarters performance reports to evaluate our progress in relation to initiatives executed in Q3 2024 ([July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-july-2024/5907), [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-august-2024/5979), reports)\n\n## Initiative 1: Scale Balancer’s On-Chain DevOps Hub\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver the last 6 months, we have taken over responsibility over most of the on-chain operations tech stack, including multi-sig management, OpenZepellin infrastructure to distribute BAL rewards, secondary incentive management as well as new chain deployments and access management.\n\nOur main focus for the next half year is to simplify and further automate any on-chain operations that the DAO has to manage. These include but are not limited to new AMM management (e.g. CoWAMMs), Balancer v3 and its corresponding new fee sweeping mechanism as well as governance operations. Two components will be crucial to drive this initiative forward: our [automation code base](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis) and our [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/).\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Operate and maintain new chain deployments for Balancer v2\n\n* Support custom infrastructure for the Balancer v2 MODE deployment incl. a dedicated MODE ve8020 gauge system on MODE network.\n* Support and integrate potential new chain deployments into our operations infrastructure such as BAL token emission scheduling through OpenZeppelin\n* Deploy and maintain any needed infrastructure to operate those chains\n\n2. Fee processing for Balancer v2\n\n* Coordinate and run fee processing of Balancer v2’s core pool framework as long as it is operational in light of the v3 launch\n* Coordinate with Mimic fee processing\n\n3. Secondary Token reward management\n\n* Build a rewards management system on Mode as part of a veMODE initiative\n* Launch a injector configuration tool on the operations UI to further improve partner management and self-service capabilities\n\n4. AURA position management\n\n* Launch a safe module to automatically relock AURA\n* Maintain the self-service module for vote placement for the BD team and design potential automation work to assign incentives without human intervention.\n\n5. Gauges and Core Pool Framework (Balancer v2)\n\n* Continued management of core pool detection and pool list curation\n* Optimization of fee structure after transitioning our focus from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3\n\n6. Management and Execution of Token Grants\n\n* Maintaining and provisioning of upcoming token distribution grants\n* Advising on how to design and execute token grant programs\n\n7. Omni-chain operations: Chainlink Automation & Gas Stations\n\n* Further optimize Chainlink upkeep monitoring and automate LINK top-ups as well as the design and development of backup systems\n* Incorporate more monitoring solutions into the [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/chainlink-automation)\n* Establish omni-chain gas station contracts to feed all relevant dependencies with ETH (or chain gas tokens) and LINK (gas for automation jobs)\n* Collaborate with Chainlink to define and ship client-side cross-chain rate providers as well as advising on oracles for omni-chain operations.\n\n8. Analytics (v2)\n\n* Transition to maintenance mode for DeFilytica deployments\n\n9. Financial reporting (v2 & v3)\n\n* Advise on financial reporting metrics with karpatkey\n* Build and ship artifacts to monitor revenue generation on Balancer v3\n\n10. Operations UI\n\n* Full GitHub integration to propose changes from the UI\n* Completion of security review with Hypernative\n* Exploration of token whitelisting module\n* Building of tooling surrounding Balancer v2 and v3 management such as monitoring dashboards for Chainlink, Injector v2 configurator or the migration of legacy pool creators for Balancer v2\n\n## Initiative 2: Support and execute on the launch of Balancer v3 and new Products\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus, Tritium\n\n**Team**: Zen Dragon, gosuto, MikeB\n\n**Summary**\n\nBalancer v3 is planned to release between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. The Maxis will play a crucial role in setting up key infrastructure that guarantees correct operations of the new protocol version across chains. We will collaborate with BLabs and other ecosystem partners to plan and execute a smooth launch which will include a rollout to a defined set of target chains and the subsequent management thereafter. Additionally, we will explore new revenue models and tokenomics adjustments that will have the most beneficial impact on both partners and the DAO.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Plan and execute on v3 launch\n2. Design, deploy and maintain all key infrastructure necessary to manage Balancer v3 on-chain\n* Integration tests before launch\n* Support and build a potential testnet deployment together with Balancer labs\n* Automation\n* Permission sets and monitoring\n* Fee collection mechanisms\n\n3. Fee processing for Balancer v3\n* Design and implement a new fee collection mechanism for Balancer v3, either on-chain or off-chain. Balancer v3’s new design will allow to more easily collect fees per pool and therefore has the potential to be built completely in-house and onchain\n\n4. Support and manage deployments on strategic chains\n* Work together with the BD Unit to utilize synergies in chain deployments\n* Coordinate expansion plans with ecosystem partners\n\n5. Design and execute a liquidity seeding plan with potential bootstrapping reward programs.\n* Management and execution of secondary token reward programs to bootstrap liquidity on products build on top of Balancer v3\n\n6. Support partners and builders in execution of product launches\n* Management and monitoring of creator fees in Balancer v3\n* Work to align new pool logic with users (DAOs seeking liquidity solutions)\n* Be leaders and/or available resources in the Balancer Community and Developer Ecosystem\n\n7. Design and build new analytics artifacts together with the product and data teams\n* Explore potential deployment of a native analytics platform on the native app\n* Advise service providers on how to incorporate key metric data based on partner feedback\n\n8. Advance Tokenomics and the DAOs Revenue Strategy\n* Balancer v3 offers the opportunity to rethink the current setup of Balancer’s tokenomics. The Maxis will lead any strategic workshops or workstreams together with key stakeholders in the DAO\n* Optimize the core pool framework based on the reduced BAL emission schedule that will go into effect in Q1 2025 (according to the BAL [emission schedule](https://dune.com/balancer/bal-supply))\n\n## Initiative 3: Partner Management\n\n**Co-Leads**: MikeB, Zen Dragon\n\n**Team**: Tritium, Zekraken\n\n**Summary**\n\nBalancer’s partner pipeline has experienced substantial growth across the 10 networks we support, and this momentum is expected to continue as V3 and aligned stakeholders drive new opportunities. Our partner management team's core objective is to not only sustain but also maximize the value of relationships with both current and new partners for the benefit of the DAO and veBAL holders. To achieve this, we will collaborate closely with the business development and DevOps teams to strategically enhance the partner experience and streamline the onboarding process for new partners. By leveraging our technical expertise and commercial focus, the partner management group is dedicated to providing the best possible experience for all stakeholders on the Balancer platform.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Assisting partners in pool choice, strategy, design, and launch assistance\n* Utilizing internal partners such as Cowswap and Gyroscope\n\n2. Building strong working relationships with internal partners to provide the best possible service and options to our partners.\n* Employing the advanced tech built on Balancer to provide optimal outcomes\n* ncluding Cowswap, Gyroscope, Xave, QuantAMM, hooks, boosted pools, and others as they present themselves.\n\n3. Overseeing ongoing revenue improvements to suggest to partners. I.e. swap fees, pool migrations, amplification parameters etc.\n4. Providing proactive partner support and guiding new partners through the ecosystem.\n* Governance, incentive markets, new launches and pooling opportunities.\n\n5. Rate Provider review facilitation and continuous process improvement\n6. Spearheading with the DevOps team to execute BD and partner requests not limited to, primarily related to smart contract interactions in a safe and efficient manner.\n7. Coordinating with compounders and wrappers to ensure our partners receive seamless integration to all relevant platforms. I.e. Beefy, Aura, StakeDAO.\n8. Working with various vote markets to improve partner incentive efficiencies and an agnostic approach to revenue flows through veBAL incentive platforms.\n\n### Service Provider Name & Overview: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers**: Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\nPledge to abide by [[BIP-629]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-629-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards: Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n1.

Over the last 6 months we have always been handling the discretionary portion very conservatively. In the last quarter, we only utilized approximately half of the $60k in allocated funds for Q3 2024. We will roll over ***savings from this cost point of more than $25k USDC*** and deduct them from this proposal.\n\nFurthermore, we improved our cost basis per FTE, all while we increased our headcount and capacity for the anticipated higher demand for Balancers v3 launch. Our average costs came down from an average of $13,484 $ / FTE to $13,212.50 $ / FTE (incl. BAL vests) compared to Q3 2024.\n\nA detailed breakdown of our proposed costs is visualized below:\n\n![|624x320](upload://m8DK7A5w9Ai4IkfttRSTMtu56Bs.png)\n\nWe are additionally asking for a BAL token grant of 32,738 BAL for the next half-year (at BAL price of $1.89). BAL will be locked for 1 year either as veBAL or in a veBAL wrapper such as auraBAL.\n\nQuarterly BAL allocation: $30,937.50 ( = 16,369 BAL)\n\nIn total our USDC and BAL cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 5 FTE:\n\n|Position|Cost Basis|\n| --- | --- |\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC + BAL vest)|$13,212.50|\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC)|$11,150|\n|$ / Freelance FTE / month (USDC)|$9,600|\n\n**Length of engagement: 6 months**\n\n**Budget: 398,135 USDC and 32,738 BAL**\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n**Impact on the Treasury**\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold 3,507,473 BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for the next half year would impact 0.93% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 1.87% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 5.727mln in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 6.95% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 13.9%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `398135` USDC as `398135000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `32738` as `32738000000000000000000`.",

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/848\n\n## Introduction\n\n \n![bip-568-1.jpg](ipfs://bafybeieaekiotvrtfwp2bb3wb5cpzdrcsq2f64c2vbqsxnii6p2wiynkni)\n    \n`The Maxis pave a luminous path towards a radiant future for the Balancer ecosystem`\n\nThe new year started with much optimism which is reflected in the increased positive momentum in the market. Balancer has pivoted as one of the main liquidity hubs for LRTs and LSTs. The Maxis have played a crucial role in making sure our various partners have a seamless experience while onboarding to Balancer tech.\n\nThis positive momentum, however, has also resulted in an immense increase in workload for Maxis, be it on the operational side or partner management. The group performed exceptionally, although we had changes in our team structure with Shakotan leaving and moving on to work for Radiant Capital.\n\nThe combination of increased responsibility and workload are key factors for us to focus on automating as many internal and on-chain processes as possible while also making the partner experience as seamless as possible - both for Balancer v2 and v3. We took a lot of learnings from Q1 and want to transition to a more professional Dev- and GovOps organization. We will therefore focus our efforts on 2 key initiatives: automation and stellar partner experience for v2 and v3. To achieve these goals we need a balance of retaining the current talented team and having enough flexibility to attract new talent for our various development tasks.\n\nAdditionally, we will undergo some structural modifications to reflect these changes: Danko and the Ballers will transition into the Balancer OpCo (Admin & Ops) for administrative and operations, ecosystem liaison and community mod tasks. This is an ideal opportunity as we further decentralize our SP landscape and strengthen our DAO, while also focusing the teams on what they are good at. Learn more about it on the Foundation’s funding [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-year-three-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/5627).\n\nWe are incredibly excited about the road ahead. Our protocol metrics show amazing performance across the board and we are dedicated to make sure Balancer will continue to be the go-to blue chip AMM in this market cycle!\n\n## Initiatives\n\nIn Q1, we introduced initiatives which helped us focus our efforts to specific work domains. In general, we had great experience with these work packages but will make sure to not overcommit this quarter with too many tasks, as smooth DAO operations are our highest priority. Therefore, we will focus our energy on 2 initiatives resulting in the highest possible impact for the DAO.\n\n### Initiative 1: Transition to a professional DevOps organization with Automation\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\nThe Balancer Maxis have been maintaining and operating key infrastructure in the DAO. These components include the [Fee sweep automation repo](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator), [Reward injectors](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/ChildChainGaugeInjectoooor) and [grant distribution automation](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/STIP_automation). Furthermore, we were assigned the task to maintain and take over the OZ defender infrastructure making sure BAL gets streamed to all Balancer deployments.\n\nWe made significant advancements in Q1 but need to further focus on streamlining all these repositories. A main focus will also be set on migrating the infrastructure we took over from BLabs to a new version as the old one will be deprecated June 1st 2024. We therefore have a clear set of objectives to fulfill and also plan to use freelance resources to complete them.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Fee Sweep Automation:\n* Refactor and improve code base incl. integration tests\n* Provide transparent and meaningful reports so that all DAO participants (investors and partners alike) can understand the mechanisms behind our core pool framework\n* Work together with Mimic or other partners to improve fee sweep performance\n*  Evaluate and improve voting incentive placements\n* Re-evaluate Aura fee recycling\n\n2. vlAURA Voting:\n* Provision automatic voting as outlined in [BIP-508](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419)\n* Make the DAO owned vlAURA position easy to maintain (relocks etc).\n\n3. OZ Defender:\n* Establish a repository in the Balancer Maxis org\n* Implement deployment pipelines with the OZ API for professional CI/CD integration\n* Migrate to OZ Defender v2 and set up the enterprise tier subscription plan. The costs will be covered by Balancer OpCo.\n* Assess and negotiate the usage of a professional subscription to run our operations\n* Implement further monitoring\n* If possible, implement gas usage optimizations\n\n4. RewardsInjector v2\n* Finalize the new design\n* Write integration tests\n* Get a smart contract review\n* Make new contract ready to be used for Q3 latest\n\n5. Gauges and core pools\n* Automatic core pool detection and maintenance\n* Automatic gauge removal flagging\n\n### Initiative 2: Grow Balancer v2 and Support v3 Design\n\n**Lead**: MikeB\n\n**Team**: Maxis\n\n**Summary**\nBalancer v3 is in active development and set to go public with developer documentation and other collateral materials in April. Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It’s crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nAt the same time, we strive to improve the quality of the partner experience for Balancer v2 while also supporting the launch on promising L2 chains with our technical expertise. Balancer v2 will remain a core component of the Balancer ecosystem and we strive to make it as easy to use as possible.\n\n**Objectives for v3 design**:\n\n* Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n* Facilitate Hook Development: Bring innovative hooks to market through developer outreach and incentive alignment.\n* Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings..\n* Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n* Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n* Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n**Objectives for v2 growth:**\n* Improve partner experience supporting the marketing team with a consistent partner onboarding pack and process\n* Improved partner onboarding experience by streamlining internal processes\n* Streamline and simplify gauge on- and offboarding (incl. automatic flagging of deprecated gauges)\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s)**: Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers:** Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** YES\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** YES\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n#### 1. Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Leading governance procedures, ensuring their execution and integrity.\n* Facilitating technical discussions within governance scopes.\n* Setting up governance votes and reviewing payloads for DAO transactions.\n* Crafting detailed governance proposals and specifications.\n* Offering deep technological insights during governance deliberations.\n* Assisting in specifications to proposals for proper payload execution\n* Infrastructure and tool creation for enhancing governance operations.\n* Automating tasks, reducing human dependency in governance functions.\n* Creating UI tools that support operational tasks (past examples: pool creation, reward injectors, linear pool deployment [deprecated])\n\n#### Strategy and Business Development\n* Applying profound product and technical knowledge in strategic planning.\n* Engaging with new partners and broader Web3 communities.\n* Providing technical support and insights for strategic development.\n* Assisting in custom pool creations and new chain launches.\n* Managing revenue flows and direct incentives with partners.\n* Facilitating discussions on financial incentives and revenue optimization.\n* Acting as active partner support and assisting new partners navigate the ecosystem\n\n#### 3. On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Overseeing DevOps and automating multisig operations.\n* Building multisig payloads and conducting multi-person peer-reviews\n* Guidance on infrastructure-related aspects.\n* Overseeing Stipend Distribution Automation\n* Coordinating protocol fee sweep automation\n* Core development, aiding in automation and data management.\n* Smart contract development(when needed)\n* Taking over on chain automation for OZ Defender and migrating to new version of it\n* Support in technical best practices.\n* Bi-weekly fees processing and reporting\n* Grant program management and operations (if applicable)\n\n#### 4. Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Designing pools for the protocol, aligning with governance specifications.\n* Liaising with the ecosystem for synchronized functionality and growth.\n* Assistance in pool design and migration to v3\n* Token whitelisting and front-end testing.\n* Assisting in the technical aspects of pool and gauge creation.\n* Testing of v3 front-end infrastructure\n\n#### 5. Data Analytics and Reporting\n* Spearheading data analytics, offering valuable insights through reports and dashboards.\n* Maintaining high-level expertise in protocol-related data.\n* Providing quarterly financial reports\n* Assisting in data handling, contributing to informed decision-making.\n\n#### Length of Engagement & Budget\n\nThe biggest adjustment in the Maxis funding proposal is the allocation of $60k USDC for discretionary budget for the entire quarter. Main reasons are the increased demand in resources to conclude tasks as described in the automation initiative like smart contract reviews, resource allocation for the OZ defender integration and stabilization of our platform. We will make sure to use these funds as conservatively as possible and will report on the usage in the monthly reports. Overall, people costs in USDC terms will be at par or below the [previous quarters](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420) ($117,000 for Q2) as the Maxis will take part of their compensation in locked BAL vesting for 1 year. The fraction of locked BAL for compensation across contributors is 56% on average.\n\nWe have furthermore deducted following savings from this quarterly funding proposal:\n* 11,880 USDC\n* 800 BAL\n\n**Length of engagement:** 3 months\n\n**Budget:** `165,120 USDC` and `18,625 BAL`\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n#### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold ~4.2M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q2 2024 would cost around 0.4% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.74% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.78M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.86% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~11.43%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nShakotan with address `0x8053484489b110181a6dba0b59dda887e433f470` will be offboarded from all relevant multi-sig safes and be replaced by gosuto.eth `0x11761c7b08287d9489CD84C04DF6852F5C07107b` (can be verified [here](http://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/541d1f22cc498623880e219011c4cc24b5208caf/extras/signers.json#L2)). It is therefore proposed to swap Shakotan for gosuto in the [Balancer Maxi Signer](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/multisig.html#operational-multisigs-signer-set-aka-balancer-maxis) set. This grants signership to a number of 3/6 multisigs. Safes, signers and permissions can be understood by reviewing this [Table](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/multisig.html#the-multisigs-and-their-addresses) in the docs.\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `165120` USDC as `165120000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `18625` as `18625000000000000000000`.",

This initiative aims to foster greater liquidity and facilitate smoother transactions for users on these platforms. By enabling this gauge, we anticipate enhancing the yield-generating opportunities for both the Balancer community and Overnight Finance users.\n\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Website: https://overnight.fi\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/overnight_fi\nDiscord: overnight-fi\nDocs: https://docs.overnight.fi\nDefillama: https://defillama.com/protocol/overnight-finance\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n> Overnight.fi is a protocol focusing on asset management, with a specialization in neutral-risk strategies. At the heart of its product line is USD+, which is a yield-driven stablecoin, fully backed by collateral. This collateral for USD+ is rooted in DeFi strategies that generate returns. These strategies encompass lending to platforms like Aave, and include both stablecoin-to-stablecoin and neutral-risk strategies.\n>\n> **USD+ by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> USD+ is a DeFi product that offers users the opportunity to invest in a diversified basket of stablecoins. The main goal of USD+ is to optimize yield generation by allocating funds across various yield-bearing protocols and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem. In essence, users deposit their stablecoins into the USD+ pool and receive interest-earning USD+ tokens in return.\n> \n> wUSD+ is a type of wrapped token within the Overnight Finance ecosystem. In simple terms, it represents a stablecoin (like USD+) that has been \"wrapped\" to create a new token that can be used within the Overnight Finance platform and potentially other decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. This wrapping process allows for more fluid and flexible utilization of the stablecoin in various financial strategies and products, facilitating smoother transactions and broader integration within the DeFi space. It essentially helps in enhancing the functionality and interoperability of the original stablecoin, USD+.\n> \n> Currently, Overnight Finance operates on multiple chains including Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, with a significant amount of total value locked (TVL) across various products:\n> \n> USD+: $21,772,869.93 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others)\n> DAI+: $9,020,297.94 TVL (Operates on Base, Optimism, Arbitrum)\n> USDT+: $472,694.69 TVL (Operates on Binance, Linea)\n> \n> **OVN by Overnight Finance**\n> \n> OVN is the native token of the Overnight Finance protocol. It serves two main purposes: to promote the use of USD+, a yield-bearing stablecoin developed by Overnight, and to facilitate decentralized risk management within the protocol. OVN holders can participate in governance decisions, helping to align community incentives and guide the protocol's development. Additionally, OVN will be used in Insurance Vaults, where it can be staked to earn insurance premiums and potentially benefit from upward price pressure due to the protocol's revenue mechanisms. The token has a fixed supply of 1,000,000, with a detailed distribution and vesting plan to ensure the maximization of its value over time. Our token has a cross-chain functionality with the help of Axelar.\n>\n>\n> Launch Price: $20\n> Presale Price: $20\n> OVN Tokenomics: [Overnight Tokenomics ($OVN)](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/overnight-tokenomics)\n> Presale Information: [Overnight Presale Information](https://docs.overnight.fi/governance/ovn-token/ovn-presale)\n> 25% of OVN from Private Presale unlocked on Oct 2. and the remaining 75 will be linearly vested for 4 weeks.\n>\n>  Additional Information:\n> - We cancelled public presale and just used the money raised from private presale to bootstrap liquidity on DEXes. \n> - We have launched at 20m FDV.\n> - We are already live on Aerodrome and Velodrome Finance. We also incentivized huge amount of bribes on Aerodrome (7400$) and Velodrome ($5,700) (For Sept. 28 - Oct. 5)\n> - We have also provided 22.5k OP for our Beefy Boost Program that will be distributed in over 2 weeks.\n> \n> - The rate providers was also reviewed by the integrations team and deemed safe.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The motivation behind introducing this pair on Balancer stems from a variety of strategic benefits that this integration would bring to both communities:\n> \n> 1. **Enhanced Liquidity**: The introduction of the OVN/wUSD+ pair on Balancer would significantly enhance the liquidity of these assets, facilitating smoother transactions and potentially reducing slippage.\n> 2. **Increased Yield Opportunities**: By leveraging Balancer's flexible and dynamic liquidity pools, users can explore new yield-generating opportunities, thereby maximizing their returns on investment.\n> 3. **Community Engagement and Growth**: This collaboration would foster greater community engagement, bringing together the vibrant communities of both Balancer and Overnight Finance, and potentially leading to innovative developments and partnerships in the future.\n> 4. **Strategic Alignment**: The integration aligns with Overnight Finance's strategy of expanding its ecosystem and enhancing the utility and value proposition of the OVN and wUSD+ tokens. It also aligns with Balancer's goal of fostering a diverse and robust DeFi ecosystem.\n> \n> Furthermore, to stimulate liquidity and encourage participation, the OVN/wUSD+ pair will be incentivized on the three chains - Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base. This incentive mechanism is designed to attract more users to the platform and foster a vibrant and active community around the OVN ecosystem.\n> \n> We aim to create a competitive environment that rewards participation and ensures the most efficient allocation of resources. We believe that veBAL voters are sophisticated and discerning and they will prioritize the community’s best interest. Complexity is often a byproduct of innovation. Our past experiences teach us valuable lessons, enabling us to build more robust systems.\n> \n> While 80/20 pools have been associated with locking, the beauty of the DeFi space is its adaptability. Our objective is to leverage the pool structure for its inherent benefits, not merely conform to traditional use-cases. The goal is to amplify liquidity and ensure stability, rather than exploit emissions. We’re using the pool to its fullest potential to cater to the evolving needs of the market. As also noted, the proposed bribe per week represents a significant boost in Aura’s bribe market, should all bribes be channeled in here.\n> \n> The absence of a defined market cap or trading history doesn’t undermine the intrinsic value of the coin or its future adoption potential. The proposed gauge allocation, especially the 2% caps, is informed by a forward-looking strategy, ensuring that it aligns with the expected bribes and accrued yield.\n> \n> The gauge allocation is in recognition of the potential this new coin brings. Traditional metrics, like trading history, might not fully capture the inherent value and projected adoption. We’re operating in a rapidly evolving landscape; hence, a forward-looking approach is crucial. Coingecko’s preview status doesn’t reflect the groundwork and strategic partnerships that underscore this project.\n> \n> The proposal aims to push the boundaries, capitalize on new opportunities, and ensure the best outcome for the community. We trust the veBAL voters to recognize the merit and long-term vision of this initiative.\n\n\n**Specifications:**\n > 1. **Governance:** Information on governance [Overview - Overnight Finance Docs (Beta)](https://docs.overnight.fi/tokenomics-and-governance/overview)\n> 2. **Oracles:** Does the protocol rely on external oracles?
