This will be used as a project buffer with funds either deployed in support of the program, recycled into ecosystem development or returned to Arbitrum DAO.\n\nSuccessful completion of these deliverables will be a major value driver for the Arbitrum ecosystem. This success of this program will be assessed through metrics including, but not limited to:\n\n* Number of active developers\n* Dev Github quality\n* Delegate engagement satisfaction\n* Voter participation\n* Capture-resistance\n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the end of Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will have delivered:\n\n**Discover | Facilitate DAO native workshops**\n\n* Conduct Arbitrum DAO Vision, Mission, Values workshops\n* Clearly define funding priorities in a bottom-up way\n* Establish and confirm key success metrics for the Grants Program\n* Scope out requirements for a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Establish clear communications cadences & channels for all key stakeholders to engage with the program\n\n**Design | Construct best in class Pluralistic Grants Program**\n\n* Identify suitable tools and technology to support a robust, secure and efficient grants program (i.e. Allo)\n* Design and process map the end to end grant funding flows\n* Design approach, process and channels for sourcing high impact grants ideas\n* Design Grantee Registration process and grant pipeline management structure\n* Design Grant Program manager application process and assessment criteria\n* Work with Gitcoin to set up and launch a Gitcoin Grants round on Arbitrum\n* Design credibly neutral grant funding evaluation criteria, reporting structure and cadence\n\n**Execute | Facilitate the successful execution of Pluralist Grants Programs**\n\n* Onboard and coach Pluralist Program Managers in grant program best practices\n* Deploy 2.6 million ARB in funding to programs selected via the Pluralist Program Managers\n* Deploy 300k ARB to Gitcoin Grants round recipients\n* Oversee grants rounds to ensure they are free from fraud or abuse\n\n**Evaluate | Report back on grant funding outcomes**\n\n* Publish financial & analytics reports on grant funding value, volume, outcomes and other relevant metrics requested by the community\n* Share key learnings and grants program best practices with Arbitrum DAO and the wider web3 community\n* Collate community feedback and input on grants programs efficacy and success\n* Evaluate, review and iterate based on this feedback to continually improve the overall impact of the Arbitrum DAO grants program\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe are here because Arbitrum intends to deploy one of the largest DAO treasuries ever to grow their ecosystem. A 10% difference in the allocation efficiency of funds could mean hundreds of millions of waste which would impede Arbitrum’s ability to actualize its full potential. It’s easy to say, “we can solve these problems later”, but we have an opportunity to start on the right track and solve these problems today\n\nThe Plurality Labs team has a chip on our shoulder. We have all been in DAOs and have seen how governance can fail, sometimes quickly, sometimes quietly. Our common thread is the shared values of trust, transparency and freedom combined with a passion for helping DAOs solve hard problems.\n\n### Issues with fully Centralized and Decentralized Grants Programs\n\nWithin web3 we have seen three main vehicles by which Grants Funding can be allocated to builders. Below we have outlined why we believe Arbitrum DAO should take a pluralist approach to grants funding.\n\n### Centralised Grants Program: Problems\n \n![0311b2837f5d19e1de6302c085e0eb8b800963cf_2_624x345.png](ipfs://bafkreidp5ob5oiuy77fqrklknkgy2jujbdeavyhhxyxptnaar7txya4ybu)\n    \n* Limited transparency and auditability: A centrally managed grants program may lack transparency in decision-making processes, grant distribution, and fund allocation. This opacity can undermine trust and hinder the overall effectiveness of the program\n* Limited community participation: Web3 communities thrive on active participation and collaboration. A centrally managed grants program may not effectively engage community members at all levels of the organization in the decision-making and codesign processes.\n* Domain expertise and scale: Volume of grants requests may overwhelm capacity of small centralized team who may also lack domain specific expertise on programs requesting funding\n* Bias and limited experimentation: Centralized Grants teams bring their standardized approach to grant vetting leading to a lack of experimentation which creates an inherent selection bias. The selection bias can even be non-malicious as they are biased by forces like being more likely to “open the door” for those who they know or have worked with before.h.\n\n### Decentralised Grants Program: Problems\n\n![b5cb3f790e8de949030775b29bba6030f6ef6421_2_624x287.png](ipfs://bafkreidqzewoyc2jyhr6a5mbqrcaml4cowvjqbp7bmtjgpzyfe2hqcwcbe)\n    \n* Lack of time: Delegates will stop engaging if the request is for more than is reasonable. Reviewing a grant, especially if it is a direct grant for larger amounts can be expected to take from 1-4 hours each. Delegates cannot take that much time.\n* Inclusion and accessibility: Navigating the delegates and governance process of a large DAO represents a major lift for any prospective grants applicants. Those able to do so will likely have the best network and most capital, not necessarily the best grants ideas…\n* Lack of coordination: With a decentralized grants program, decision-making and coordination are distributed among multiple stakeholders. This can lead to challenges in achieving consensus, coordinating efforts, and aligning priorities.\n* Evaluation of impact: It is challenging for the DAO to assess the relative impact of different grants programs if no standardized reporting cadence, key metrics and evaluation criteria is maintained centrally.\n* Mitigating risks and fraud: Decentralized grants programs are vulnerable to risks such as fraudulent proposals, mismanagement of funds, and malicious actors. Implementing mechanisms for due diligence, verification, reputation systems and Sybil defense can help mitigate these risks and protect the integrity of grants funding.\n* Not fully developed: Even solutions like quadratic funding which lets users directly express their interest still require a program manager. They must shepherd the round and ensure quality fraud protection while making objective decisions about eligibility criteria, user and project appeals, and more. Until we design the open and permissionless protocol to handle these subjective components, the model still has single points of failure.\n\n### Launching the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program\n\nA Pluralist Grants program provides a perfect middle ground between Decentralized and Centralized Grants programs, unlocking the “best of both worlds.\n\nAt its core the Pluralistic Grants Model will see the Pluralistic Grants Program Allocator onboard 4-6 pluralist grants managers who will be responsible for distributing funds to grant applicants that benefits the Arbitrum Ecosystem. Sourcing and selection of these ideas will use novel combinations of bottoms-up and top-down mechanisms facilitated by Plurality Labs.\n\nThe programs will focus on specific needs within the ecosystem and their potential impact, for example, one Pluralist Grants Manager may focus on bringing a novel new technique for fund allocation or deep grants proposal expertise (i.e. Questbook). Another might stand up an Arbitrum gaming specific grants program. This flexibility allows for experimentation to allow Arbitrum DAO to discover what works best and allows for the specific needs of the Arbitrum ecosystem to be catered to.\n\nOur approach includes a progressive decentralization of the Pluralist Grants Program Allocator. During Milestone 1, Plurality Labs will maintain accountability for sourcing, selecting, reporting on and delivering results of the chosen pluralist grants programs.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 will see experimentation with decentralized allocation mechanisms in a Proof of Concept stage with the goal of running at least one round of Pluralist Grants Program selection in a fully decentralized way without needing any corrective intervention.\n\n![0e9c91acb14f197ac0396d79f28b7f530aedfd36_2_624x363.png](ipfs://bafkreiaumlf7kbilxwrxnx7hixajjiz5pzbpr73ciybkkgdnbqsjefqzru)\n    \n> 💡The Pluralist Grants Programs will be selected after the proposal passes governance and the Discovery Phase is completed.\n\nDuring the discovery phase, we will gather input from delegates and the broader community to define the vision, mission, and values of the Arbitrum DAO, and determine what needs to be funded.\n\nOnce this foundation is established, we will evaluate the best domains and mechanisms for allocating resources and capital to grantees. Pluralistic Program managers will play a crucial role in promoting experimentation, decentralization of decisions, and improved resource allocation outcomes.\n\nWe have observed that many previous grants programs has struggled with an inability to source great grant opportunities, which we hope to address in the following ways:\n\n* Applications to be program managers should separate from the applications for grant program ideas\n* Create a backlog of “high impact work to be done” be created, allowing competent builders to step to deliver impact for Arbiturm DAO\n* Create a list of builders, potential grantees, and those interested in supporting the Arbitrum ecosystem which can be direct towards the “high impact work that needs to be done”\n* Robust evaluation and reporting facilitated by Plurality Labs reduce time/effort/reliance on Project Manager and Grantees to demonstrate their success to the community\n* Launch a Grant Program accelerator program to provide grantees clear guidelines, training and support to develop a high quality grant submissions\n\nThe selection of the Pluralist Grants Programs and their managers will involve a facilitated bottoms-up approach, sourcing ideas, people, and processes. Factors considered in the selection may include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Previous experience delivering grants programs.\n* Domain expertise and knowledge\n* Ability to source innovate grants projects and support in the maintenance of a health pipeline of grants submission\n* Maturity of program specific processes and tooling\n* Nature of proposed funding allocation mechanism and data on demonstrated impact/success of mechanism\n* Demonstrated involvement with and commitment to Arbitrum ecosystem and its values\n\nThis is an exhaustive list, and the criteria for selecting Program Managers will be further refined in the Discovery and Design phase, with input from delegates and the broader community. We are committed to maintaining credible neutrality in the selection process.\n\nWith this approach we are confident that the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants Program will be fair, impactful and ultimately support the growth and success of the Arbitrum Ecosystem.\n\n### The Pluralistic Grants model also provides 300k ARB to support matching Gitcoin rounds which run on Arbitrum.\n\nThis is not payment to Gitcoin the organization, but a payment to grant recipients in a Gitcoin Arbitrum round we intend to launch. Gitcoin core rounds include support for Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, & Zero Knowledge. This aligns with the stated Arbitrum goal of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem while also attracting users which might otherwise choose another L2. It also allows us to tap into support of the Gitcoin DevRel team to help source builders, host hackathons.\n\nFunding grants this way will not only benefit the Arbitrum ecosystem, but enable the Gitcoin product team to prioritize making their Allo protocol available on Arbitrum. By being able to execute pluralistic programs on their Allo protocol allows us an open data substrate which will enable us to compare programs and projects across the pluralist framework. It also allows program managers to use quadratic funding and quadratic voting (if they choose) which require Sybil defense. This is a crucial enabler for the next section.\n\n![88d617338384427ed53607b929264bc8b623ef43_2_624x281.png](ipfs://bafkreiaylf4ugerhg5c755rx2ffjydpjcri6sx7mohjrafoiuylihkijfy)\n    \n### Improved Accountability, Transparency and Reporting are key benefits of the Pluralistic Grants model.\n\nWeb3 spends 100’s of millions annually on different grants and grants programs and to date, there has been little focus on the efficiency of those grant programs or the efficacy of their spend. We intend to build grant program efficiency metrics as well specific grantee project efficacy (or results) metrics.\n\nBy using a common framework for executing a plurality of grant programs, we have the ability to identify, track and refine metrics for each unique grant program. Something that has not been done to date, and would be more difficult to do in stand alone grant environments.\n\nBy doing this, we can begin to build qualitative data on the efficiency of each distribution method in a way that can identify improvements for that mechanism, but also compare mechanisms across stakeholder groups and use cases. By building these metrics, Arbitrum will be able to parse down the crowded field of grant-execution options and deliver the most effective Grants Program web3 has seen to date.\n\nGrant program execution typically stops when the money has been distributed, and we think that is premature. As part of this program we intend to experiment with a series of existing post-project evaluation tools (after action reviews, qualitative/quantitative metrics, case studies) but add in or invent novel web3 project evaluation solutions (hypercerts, on-chain analysis, panel reviews) to rate every project receiving funding in a way that can demonstrate the efficacy of the spending as it relates to building the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nWe know there are inefficiencies and fraud in the web3 grant mechanisms; this part of the program allows Arbitrum to make the most of its investments. Doing this will lead to a higher return on the Arbitrum investment and more funding for the most worthy projects, while leaving room to experiment with the novel web3 mechanism that can help us revolutionize the grant process.\n\n### Multisig Management\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Grants Safety Multisig*. This multisig will review, sign and execute all fund disbursement for the Arbitrum DAO Pluralistic Grants program. The role of the grants multisig is to process the requests made by Plurality Labs while also being able to review issues. At no point will Plurality Labs hold the funds designated for grant funding. The final form of this proposal will either name the selected individual or state the electoral process.\n\n> 💡 We also intend to use the Zodiac module shared by the Tally team allowing the DAO the ability to clawback funds from the grants program at any time.\n\n### Team\n\nPlurality Labs Team\n\n**Disruption Joe**\n\nRan grants operations for Gitcoin Grants rounds 8-10 growing gross marketplace value from $2 - $10 million.

In August 2022, he joined Gitcoin where he currently leads governance\n\n### Looking Ahead: Milestone 2 & 3\n\nThe overall plan is to deploy a pluralist grants framework which operates in a politically decentralized & capture resistant way. This will fund grants programs in a continuous way that minimizes bureaucracy and increases action while providing accountability as part of the system.\n\nPrior to releasing funds for milestone 2 to begin, Plurality Labs will offer a review of the previous milestone accomplishments and failures. They will provide a breakdown at that time based on how this project evolves.\n\nMilestones 2 & 3 are about scaling the frameworks and models we use while iteratively testing them. After Milestone 3, we hope to have built the needed components for this whole process to run on chain.\n\nIf successful, Plurality Labs would no longer be needed as a project manager of the overall grants program. Onchain decisions of the community would allocate funding to the programs which have been proven useful. Plurality labs could then be an equal peer to any other program competing for a portion of continuous funding available to the ecosystem.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n1.

        "author": "0xA5dF0cf3F95C6cd97d998b9D990a86864095d9b0",
        "body": "Abstract\ntl;dr: AIP-1.1 proposes (1) a lockup, (2) a budget and (3) transparency reporting regarding the 7.5% of the $ARB tokens distributed to the Foundation’s “Administrative Budget Wallet”.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used for covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation, payment of service providers, and for the purpose of fostering the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem. In respect to the 7.5% that has been distributed to the Administrative Budget Wallet, a transparency report regarding the 0.5% that has already been transferred is available here 163.\n\nThe remaining 7% of tokens will not be used until the approval of a budget, such as the one proposed in this AIP. The proposed budget is in-line with the Foundation’s strategic needs to represent and service the DAO and the allocation is smaller than initial allocations to peer foundations. This AIP proposes placing the 7% outstanding distribution in a smart contract-controlled lockup – linearly unlocking over 4 years – alongside transparency report structures to allow the DAO to periodically monitor expenditures and other activities of the Foundation.\n\nThe Administrative Budget Wallet will be used in pursuit of the Foundation’s mission statement as set out in the bylaws 24, which includes financing technical improvements and operations of the Arbitrum network, fostering ecosystem growth through grants to align with partner projects and educational initiatives with in-person and online events.\n\nMotivation\nOn March 16, 2023, the Arbitrum networks (Arbitrum One and Arbitrum Nova) were decentralized and given to the newly formed Arbitrum DAO. Included in this transition were:\n\n-Control of the upgradeability and technical future of the chains\n-Control over the DAO treasury\n-Control over net fee revenue - i.e. the net difference between fees collected by on-chain operations and L1 fees paid by the Sequencer\n-All Arbitrum social media platforms and accounts\n-Ability to elect and, if deemed appropriate, remove the Security Council and Directors\n\nFull responsibility of the chain’s technology, future, and fee revenue were given to the DAO directly. With the DAO assuming those rights and controls, the DAO also assumed the responsibility to fund the ongoing operations of the chains and the costs of running critical chain infrastructure, including RPCs, the Sequencer, and third-party vendors and service contracts.\n\nWhile there are many activities that the DAO can do directly on-chain, several of its responsibilities require a representative that can engage, maintain and enter new agreements with service providers to run infrastructure that’s critical for the ecosystem (e.g. servers, RPCs, block explorers, data feeds and analytics platforms, and tooling), and ensure that both the chain and the ecosystem have the support they need to continue to thrive. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the DAO without any interruption of services, it was necessary to create an organization that would be ready to service the DAO immediately from launch.\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation was created to fill this need, with its mission and scope outlined across the Foundation Bylaws 24. Prior to the launching of the DAO, The Arbitrum Foundation assumed responsibilities for funding and running chain infrastructure. However, in an arrangement that appears to be unique amongst Arbitrum’s peers, the Foundation does not receive or control the net revenue from transaction fees as this is given directly to the DAO treasury.\n\nThe DAO is also tasked with fostering and developing the Arbitrum ecosystem, where the DAO may seek to partner with companies or organizations that either cannot or will not publicly negotiate collaborations or partnerships due to confidentiality and other operational requirements. Often, large enterprises negotiate partnership opportunities in private without public processes, where these relationships can only be disclosed after they are agreed upon. Having a well-funded Foundation empowered to represent the DAO in this arena, alongside peer foundations, is in the best interests of the DAO to further develop the growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nRationale\nWhile the need for the Foundation to exist and represent the DAO is well-motivated, it became clear through community discourse around AIP-1 that it was important to have additional insight and restrictions on the Foundation’s initial funding. This AIP-1.1 proposes a detailed set of controls and initiatives to achieve that goal.\n\n1. Smart Contract Lockup:\n\nThe remaining 7% of ARB tokens in the “Administrative Budget Wallet” will be subject to a four year lockup schedule, unlocking on a continuous linear time basis commencing from the date of the Snapshot approval of AIP-1.1 by the DAO (i.e., a total of 175m $ARB released over each year for 4 years). The lockup will be enforced on-chain through a smart contract which will designate a multisig wallet controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation as the beneficiary. The lockup contract will be configured in a manner that allows the DAO to adjust future funding and/or modify the unlock schedule.\n\n2. Operating Budget:\n\nBelow is a proposed annual operational budget for the first year of the Foundation. While the operational costs are denominated in USD, the expectation is that approximately half will be paid in USD and half will be paid in locked $ARB tokens.\n\nAs this will be the first year of the Foundation’s operation and as the Foundation is still young at the time of this AIP, it goes without saying that these are estimates with the expectation that this will be an upper bound on the operational costs for the first 12 months. The transparency reports described in the next section will be an opportunity to track the actual expenses against the budgeted categories and keep the community informed.\n\nOperating Budget: Cost ($USD)\nGeneral and Administrative:\t$16,000,000\nR&D:\t$9,000,000\nTechnical Infrastructure:\t$5,000,000\nEvents, Marketing & Communications:\t$6,000,000\nTotal - Next Twelve Months:\t$36,000,000\n(50% $USD/50% $ARB)\n\n*The General and Administrative line-item includes personnel, contractors, legal, insurance and other operational costs. As of the date of this AIP, the Foundation currently has five full-time contributors, 8 contractors, and the Security Council engaged to support the Arbitrum ecosystem. The Foundation’s budget anticipates the need to hire an additional 15 full-time contributors across technical, growth and community functions over the course of this year.\n\nThis operating budget presents best-faith estimates of the Foundation’s anticipated budgetary needs which may be subject to change.\n\n3. Ecosystem Growth Initiatives\n\nAny additional funds released in compliance with the lock-up schedule above will be made available, but not necessarily deployed, to opportunistically pursue ecosystem growth opportunities and strategic partnerships on behalf of the DAO. The expectation is that the vast majority of ecosystem growth funds will be paid in tokens, and thus will not require the Foundation to sell any tokens. Wherever reasonable, the Foundation will include additional lockups and/or vesting when making distributions in tokens.\n\nThe Mission Statement in the Foundation’s bylaws 24 highlights the varied nature of the opportunities the Foundation intends to pursue, and a set of KPIs that can track all of these opportunities being developed. The basis of those KPIs will stem from a focus on onboarding and growing both the developer and user base of the Arbitrum ecosystem, attracting best-in-class infrastructure providers to the network, expanding across various industries, use-cases and scope of projects that engage with Arbitrum technology. The ultimate goal of the Foundation is to continue to foster the development of the technology and expand the Arbitrum ecosystem globally.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation’s processes for selecting grants, it is important to note that the DAO maintains control over the 3.527 billion $ARB and has the ability to distribute any additional grants as it sees fit. Additionally, should the DAO choose, it has the ability to trigger the inflation of the total supply of $ARB which will supplement the on-chain DAO treasury with 2% growth of the total supply of $ARB each year.\n\n4. Transparency Reports\n\nThe Foundation understands and agrees that the community should have oversight across how these funds are being utilized to gain comfort that spending is in the interest of the community. In furtherance of this goal, the Foundation is committed to providing a comprehensive annual report and a semi-annual progress update. This will provide the community with a better understanding of the Foundation’s expenditures, balance sheet and its pursuit of ecosystem growth opportunities alongside partnership developments, as well as the various internal and external committees and stakeholders that are involved in the decision making process.\n\nThe Foundation is continuing to build out its internal personnel to service grant requests and has already engaged a DAO service provider to assist with the administrative components of servicing grants. The Foundation is also talking with a number of different external service providers to assist in both the review and diligence processes.\n\nThe financial element of these transparency reports will include a breakdown of operational costs incurred while running the Foundation, including infrastructure spending for the Arbitrum chains, events, community building efforts, grants, etc.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned reports, the Foundation is providing an initial transparency report alongside this AIP covering all major actions and decisions the Foundation made during set-up, including the costs incurred up until now, which can be found here 163.\n\nSteps to Implement\n\n1. Foundation to deploy smart contract vesting wallet in the specified configuration and transfer 700 million $ARB to it.\n2. Foundation to implement all processes described in this AIP.\nTimeline\n\nThis AIP-1.1 shall be posted on the DAO forum and will have at least a 72-hour period for DAO comments and input. After the end of the 72-hour period and appropriate updates incorporating DAO feedback, this AIP-1.1 will be posted for vote on Snapshot for an additional 7 days.\n\n",

        "title": "Arbitrum DAO Grants - Delegated Domain Allocation by Questbook",
        "author": "0xb29A655f3D67B2B6724Fb22B2C2303cB660c946B",
        "body": "Author\nSaurabh, Questbook \n\nType \n**Non-Constitutional**\n\n### **Abstract**\n\n- We propose Arbitrum DAO to launch Arbitrum grants program with a budget of $1M spread across 2 quarters to fund a *wide variety* of teams building apps on top of Arbitrum in a transparent manner. Questbook is leading [Compound](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) grants program through [delegated domain capital allocation model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/) , a community-run grants program.\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by **4** **individuals called Domain Allocators - chosen from the community and by the community**. These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are strategic areas of focus for which Arbitrum wants to disburse grants\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards. At the end of the quarter, the Arbitrum community can vote to replace, continue domain allocators or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/) ) **will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way**. We have previously set up or currently setting up the grants process for Compound, Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nAs we continue to experience the depth of the bear market, it is increasingly important for Arbitrum to retain the mindshare of key ecosystem contributors and incentivize builders to build on top of it. Grants program is a great way to attract high-quality builders and grow the ecosystem more quickly. This proposal details the benefit to all the stakeholders involved - token holders, builders and DAO members\n### **Rationale** **(Benefits to Arbitrum)**\n\nThe proposed structure will lead to the following outcomes:\n\n1. **Aligned allocation of funds:** By leveraging the Delegated Domain Allocator (DDA) model, Arbitrum DAO can ensure that funds are allocated to projects that align with the domain (selected by the Arbitrum community), promoting efficient and effective use of resources. This approach aligns with Arbitrum’s goal of enabling the distribution of grants and empower the community to build and participate in the future of the Arbitrum.\n2. **Increased transparency:** The Delegated Domain Allocator approach provides a clear and transparent process for allocating funds, ensuring stakeholders understand the decision-making process and building community confidence. Questbook, a decentralized grant management platform, provides a transparent space for teams to showcase their backgrounds and experience. In addition, Questbook’s reporting features will allow Arbitrum to quickly generate monthly reports on the allocation of funds, with the details for each grant proposal.\n3. **Increased accountability:** With a dedicated group of stakeholders responsible for allocating funds, the Delegated Domain Allocator approach promotes increased accountability, ensuring that the funds are used effectively and efficiently. Domain allocators can be replaced through a community vote if their performance is not up to the standards accepted by the community.\n4. **Lower** **Turnaround Time (TAT):** The Delegated Domain Capital Allocation model will help improve proposals’ turnaround time and overall outcomes for the ecosystem. **An example of this is Compound who’s already leveraging the DDA model and has a communication TAT of less than 48 hours.** The performance of domain allocators will be measured using objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure goals are achieved efficiently and effectively.\n5. **Strong Brand Recognition** : The Delegated Domain Allocator model will play a crucial role in boosting developer engagement with Arbitrum, as well as forming strategic partnerships with important ecosystems to jointly fund grants in mutually beneficial areas. \n\n### **Specifications**\n\nThe program structure focuses on having community members as domain allocators. Arbitrum DAO will be required to set a budget of $1M to be disbursed by 4 domain allocators and for committee compensation. Each domain allocator will be elected by the community. Interested community members can self-nominate themselves to be considered for becoming a domain allocator. The domain allocator for each domain will be selected via a community-wide Snapshot vote. Domain allocators will run their domain on-chain for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community in order to evaluate the domain allocator’s performance.\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n**Arbitrum Grants Committee**\n\nThe program will consist of\n\n1. A Program Manager\n2. 4 Domain Allocators\n\n \n![1.1.png](ipfs://bafkreicew52tsgud3subrurhrv6jud3zyep743fpgfiv4yzw54nnty423m)\n    \n\nWe propose  [Tally’s Zodiac Governor Module](https://docs.tally.xyz/user-guides/using-governor-with-gnosis-safe/zodiac-governor-module-for-subdaos-and-grants-programs) for security purposes. Furthermore, a Grants SAFE with 4/6 multi-sig will be set up between the program manager and 4 domain allocators. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 3/3 multi-sig setup between the program manager, the specific domain allocator, and one member from the DAO.\n\nWe have identified the following domains based on our thorough research and the feedback from the Arbitrum team and community.\n\n![1.2.png](ipfs://bafkreifk7yaqw2lvwj35tx2rumagctyd3of6nd2bh3fawsiij74bmdlyv4)\n\n## Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:\n\nThe following will be the roles and responsibilities of the selected domain allocators.\n\n1. Time commitment per week: Maximum of 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager will ensure that the workload is evenly distributed\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Work with the Arbitrum team and the elected domain allocators to create and list out the necessary RFPs\n        2. Identify key areas and relevant ecosystem partners who will co-fund grants alongside Arbitrum\n        3. Create marketing content for communicating RPFs to the builders\n        4. Coordinate between Arbitrum team and the community regarding cohort announcement and funding requirements\n        5. Communicate the information regarding approval/rejection of proposals to the Arbitrum community regularly\n        6. Attend community calls, actively participate in the community forum, and keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program\n        7. Regularly update the progress of the grants program to the Arbitrum community over Discord and community calls\n        8. Bi-weekly reporting of key metrics of the grants program and progress each selected project such as:\n  \n \n![13a.png](ipfs://bafybeihd4opx3atmhvarhrd5t6edpmpyfi4m6ptblpl4siihpqip5qh2wu)\n    \n    \n\n2. Grants Program: \na. Source good-quality proposals from developer communities\nb. Sign the transactions for the approved projects\nc. Ensure a quick turnaround time for proposers regarding their proposal decision\nd. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the workload is evenly distributed and take their feedback consistently\n\n3. Domain Allocator:\n    1. Review proposals received for their domains based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator\n    2. Reject/Approve proposals and coordinate consistently with the program manager\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to developer communities in their network\n    4. Discuss program improvements with the other domain allocators and program manager during scheduled meetings.\n\n### **Compensation:**\n\nThe grant budget will be $1M with $200k for each domain. The committee compensation will be $200K for 4 domain allocators and one program manager for 6 months. Note that this is the proposed budget. All unallocated funds from every domain and committee compensation will be returned to the treasury. The compensation for Domain Allocators and Program Managers has been factored into this overall proposed budget. Please find below its details.\n \n![14aaa.png](ipfs://bafybeig7zsa7e7vdk7zdnmspuq4z6ciajxorckhiy3ckpro4xfcv6ycheq)\n    \nP.S\n\n1. We are inviting applications for all domain allocator roles. Once this proposal passes through Snapshot, we will create a separate forum post for the nomination of domain allocators. Delegates and community members can self-nominate themselves under the post for two weeks. After the nomination period, a snapshot vote will be conducted.\n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\nObjective\n1. The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Arbitrum’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n2. Increase in the number of builders, proposals, and funded projects\n3. Number of partners who are co-funding grants alongside Arbitrum in mutually beneficial areas\n4. Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs)\n5. Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n6. Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains during Arbitrum’s community call\n7. Increased engagement in builder community’s\nDiscourse\nDiscord, Telegram\nSocial media (Twitter, Reddit)\nGitHub\n\nSubjective\n1. Improved community involvement in the grants program\n2. Strengthened builders’ sentiment towards Arbitrum\n3. Enhanced Arbitrum’s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook’s role in Arbitrum’s Grant Program\n\n- Saurabh from Questbook will be the program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community. Saurabh was previously working very closely with the Program manager of Polygon, where he facilitated the disbursement of approximately $1 million in grants. Saurabh has received a grant from IoTeX to establish their grant program, and he works closely with the Program Manager of Compound Grants Program 2.0. Saurabh has spoken to more than 100 builders and teams over the last 6-8 months and understands what it takes to make a grant program successful - from both program manager and builder perspectives.\n- Questbook Grants tool will make sure the workflows are systematic and transparent.\n\n### Product Flows\n\n1.

The ArbitrumDAO Constitution, located at https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation, a Cayman Islands foundation company, which will serve the ArbitrumDAO community and be governed by it, aims to foster the growth and development of the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO will have the ability to submit Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (“**AIPs**”), vote on them and make them a reality through The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\nThe guiding values of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO are described in Section 5 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution and are incorporated herein.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe Arbitrum Foundation serves the ArbitrumDAO by administering the wishes of the community and otherwise adhering to its guiding values. The Arbitrum Foundation and DAO governance are intended to serve as vehicles enabling impactful, transparent and fair decentralized governance by the broader Arbitrum community.\n\nThrough the submission of AIPs, the ArbitrumDAO will be able to collectively decide and effectuate changes ranging from core protocol technology to non-technical decisions that otherwise impact the community and $ARB tokenholders.\n\n\n### Specifications\n\n**Governance powers breakdown**\n\n**1. $ARB Tokenholders**\n\n* $ARB tokenholders, who make up the ArbitrumDAO, play the most critical role in the proper functioning of decentralized governance in the pursuit of a trustless, transparent and verifiable Arbitrum ecosystem. As Arbitrum is intended to be a public good, it is only right that governance over it should be governed by those for whom such public good is intended for.\n\n* $ARB tokenholders have the ability to directly propose, vote on and effectuate on-chain AIPs with respect to the ArbitrumDAO-approved chains.\n\n\n**2. Special Grants**\n\n* The Arbitrum Foundation shall be permitted to issue grants out of the Administrative Budget Wallet without undergoing a full on-chain AIP process (such grants, “**Special Grants**”).\n\n* The rationale behind the ability of The Arbitrum Foundation to issue Special Grants is to avoid inundating governance with grant applications, while at the same time alleviating voter fatigue.\n\n* The Special Grants application process and criteria will be released at a later date by The Arbitrum Foundation.\n\n\n**3. Directors**\n\nAs a Cayman Islands foundation, The Arbitrum Foundation is required to have at least 1 director responsible for the management and operation of The Arbitrum Foundation, in particular approving and entering into contractual arrangements on behalf of The Arbitrum Foundation (i.e., the parties actually approving and signing agreements).|\n\nThe directors are responsible for ensuring that AIPs do not:\n\n* Compromise their fiduciary duties owed to The Arbitrum Foundation;\n* Violate The Arbitrum Foundation’s Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association or bylaws, the ArbitrumDAO Constitution, the AIP Process or any other laws or regulations of applicable jurisdictions (including but not limited to Cayman Islands laws); and \n* Cause The Arbitrum Foundation to be in breach or violation of any contracts, agreements or any other arrangements.\n\nThe initial directors of The Arbitrum Foundation are: \n* Campbell Law, \n* Edward Noyons and \n* Ani Banerjee\n\nThe ArbitrumDAO may remove or elect The Arbitrum Foundation’s directors or expand or reduce the number of directors at any time pursuant to a Non-Constitutional AIP\n\n**4.\tSecurity Council**\nThe Security Council is a committee of 12 members of a multi-sig wallet which has the ability to perform both Emergency and Non-Emergency Actions, which are further detailed in Section 3 of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nThe initial Security Council members, split by cohort, are as follows:\n\ni.\tSeptember Cohort\n1.\t[Mo Dong](https://twitter.com/no89thkey) is the Co-Founder of Celer Network.

Data Availability Committee (Arbitrum Nova chain only)**\n\nTransactions occurring on the Arbitrum Nova chain are settled on Ethereum mainnet, but, unlike transactions occurring on the Arbitrum One chain, the underlying transaction data batches are posted and stored by the members of the Data Availability Committee on a [Data Availability Server](https://developer.arbitrum.io/das/daserver-instructions) (and not on Ethereum mainnet).\n\nThe initial members of the Data Availability Committee are authorized representatives of the following parties:\n* Reddit, Inc.\n* ConsenSys Software Inc.\n* QuikNode, Inc.\n* P2P Business Technologies\n* Google Cloud ( Google LLC.)\n* Offchain Labs, Inc.\n* Opensea Innovation Labs Private Limited\n\n\nData Availability Committee members can be appointed and removed at any time pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO. In the event that a Data Availability Committee member is removed (and not otherwise replaced) pursuant to a Constitutional AIP approved by the ArbitrumDAO, or in the event that a Data Availability Committee member resigns without a replacement, the Security Council may execute an emergency action (9-of-12 approval required) to appoint a replacement for such removed or resigned Data Availability Committee member.\n\n### AIP Guidelines and Process Breakdown\n\nSection 2 of the ArbitrumDAO Constitution lays out the AIP process and voting procedures, as well as the various categories of AIPs, and is incorporated herein.\n\n**Arbitrum Voting Protocol Procedure**\n\n1. [Tally.xyz](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum) will act as the initial on-chain voting platform for the ArbitrumDAO to submit and vote on AIPs\n\n2. Tally will serve as a front-end user interface that allows DAO members to do several things, namely:\n*   Create AIPs;\n*   View delegates and their voting share;\n*   Re-delegate votes to a different delegate;\n*   View current and past AIPs;\n*   Vote on AIPs on-chain, interacting with the on-chain governance contracts via the Tally front-end; and\n*   View the status of AIP execution during all voting stages\n\n### **Steps to Implement**\n\n1. Ratification of formation of The Arbitrum Foundation and its [Amended & Restated Memorandum of Association](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MLHbkvCgbP9grygn6YfxxM9oA_T1mEK-aYDD7nRA04/edit?usp=sharing) and [bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkV8IC-TXQFjPZn5_IJGb2wjlxNTjDZXK3cCzoF8hqM/edit?usp=sharing) linked in this AIP-1.\n2. Ratification of the [ArbitrumDAO Constitution](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/dao-constitution)\n3. Ratification of Security Council and Data Availability Committee member appointments and respective powers\n4. Ratification of the following allocations of the L2 basefee on the Arbitrum Nova chain: 8% of the basefee to the Data Availability Committee and 12% of the basefee to Arbitrum Nova validators\n5. Ratification of the funding of the DAO Treasury (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution)\n6. Approval of the AIP process as described in this AIP-1\n7. Completed setup of the [Arbitrum ](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation)[Forum](http://forum.arbitrum.io), [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/arbitrumfoundation.eth) and [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/arbitrum)\n8. Ratification of funding the Administrative Budget Wallet\n9. Ratification of reimbursement of costs as illustrated in the Overall Cost sections below and disbursement of such reimbursements to applicable service providers\n\n**Timeline**\n\nSolution prepared and ready to be ratified and approved\n\n**Overall Costs**\n\n**Initial Setup Costs of The Arbitrum Foundation and ArbitrumDAO**\n\nTotal setup costs, including legal costs, DAO administration setup and registration fees to be reimbursed to service providers:  $3.5 million (“**Total Setup Costs**”)\n\n**DAO Treasury**\nIn order to best provide the ArbitrumDAO with the ability to effectively govern and foster the development of Governed Chains (as defined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution), 3,527,046,079 $ARB tokens have been transferred to the DAO Treasury. The ArbitrumDAO will have direct on-chain governance powers over the DAO Treasury in accordance with the AIP process as delineated in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution.\n\n\n**The Arbitrum Foundation Administrative Budget Wallet**\n\nFor the sake of operational and administrative efficiency, a separate account controlled by The Arbitrum Foundation will be created (“**Administrative Budget Wallet**”). 750 million $ARB tokens will be transferred to the Administrative Budget Wallet for purposes of making Special Grants, reimbursing applicable service providers for the Total Setup Costs and covering ongoing administrative and operational costs of The Arbitrum Foundation. Further funding of the Administrative Budget Wallet shall require approval of an AIP by the ArbitrumDAO pursuant to the AIP process.\n\n[The Arbitrum Foundation Memorandum of Association](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19MLHbkvCgbP9grygn6YfxxM9oA_T1mEK-aYDD7nRA04)\n\n[The Arbitrum Foundation Bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YkV8IC-TXQFjPZn5_IJGb2wjlxNTjDZXK3cCzoF8hqM/edit?usp=sharing)",

The timeline metrics show strong early and stable support for the 'For' option. Forum sentiment is mixed but overall leans positive with many community members highlighting Camelot's native ecosystem role and its track record of supporting numerous protocols. Some concerns were raised about grant size and competition fairness, but these are outweighed by the expected ecosystem benefits and Camelot's commitment to transparency and accountability.",
