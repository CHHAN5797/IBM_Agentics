        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] Gas Rebate for Recognized Delegates\nauthor: @lbsblockchain, @MarcZeller Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI)\ncreated: 2023-05-31\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis ARFC introduces a mechanism for reimbursing gas fees to recognized delegates who vote on-chain on Aave.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs Ethereum gas fees continue to rise, the cost of on-chain governance for delegates has proportionally increased. This ARFC proposes a rebate system for these gas fees, aiming to incentivize active engagement and cultivate a more diverse voter base.\n\nRebating delegates for their participation offers several benefits:\n\n- Encourages more active engagement from the delegate community by eliminating the disincentive to vote, leading to better decision-making for Aave.\n- Fosters a more diverse voter base, including student organizations, by reducing the barrier to entry for voting. This creates a more open and collaborative delegate ecosystem, driving participation.\n- Helps retain top delegates to foster the growth of the Aave ecosystem. Aave should remain competitive with its peers (e.g., Maker) to attract and retain the best delegate talent. The fundamental cost of being an excellent Aave delegate should not result in a net cost to the delegate due to ever-increasing gas costs.\n- Can be achieved at a relatively low cost. We also propose measures to reduce the administrative burden for Aave.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Claiming Process\n\nEvery quarter, an ARFC will be proposed (with the current one being the first) to publish an AIP reimbursing gas fees spent by recognized delegates.\n\nThese gas fees are determined by an open-source script written by @JosepBove, which allows anyone to generate a JSON file of recognized delegates' gas spending.\n\nThis script can be run and verified by any community member to approve the amounts distributed to recognized delegates.\n\nOnce a consensus has been reached on an ARFC, an appointed Governance Facilitator will submit an AIP to transfer aWETH to the delegate's address. We initially propose that the Aave Chan Initiative serves as the Governance Facilitator.\n\n### Gas Rebate Token\n\nWe propose that the Gas Rebate Token be wETH.\n\n## Proposed reimboursement\n\nhere's the output of the script for the previous quarter, covering AIP-165 until AIP-236 and Ethereum blocks from `16726166` until `17343620`:\n\n| Name          | Address                                      | Gas Used                  |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| ACI           | 0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4 | 0.95                      |\n| ACI AIP deployer              | 0x3Cbded22F878aFC8d39dCD744d3Fe62086B76193 | 0.33                      |\n| Flipside      | 0x62a43123FE71f9764f26554b3F5017627996816a | 0.38                      |\n| TokenLogic    | 0xA06c2e5BB33cd6718b08EC9335081Cbba62861f7 | 0.21                      |\n| michigan      | 0x13BDaE8c5F0fC40231F0E6A4ad70196F59138548 | 0.21                      |\n| LBS Blockchain| 0xB83b3e9C8E3393889Afb272D354A7a3Bd1Fbcf5C | 0.26                      |\n| Wintermute    | 0xB933AEe47C438f22DE0747D57fc239FE37878Dd1 | 0.19                      |\n| keyrock       | 0x1855f41B8A86e701E33199DE7C25d3e3830698ba | 0.16                      |\n| Stablelab     | 0xea172676E4105e92Cc52DBf45fD93b274eC96676 | 0.29                      |\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skyward.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to @JosepBove, a new contributor to the ACI, for developing the GasRebate Script.

This would be achieved by integrating sDAI, an ERC-4626 Vault token that includes the DSR yield, into the Aave protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe DSR is a variable rate set by MakerDAO governance that allows DAI holders to earn savings by locking their DAI into the DSR contract. Recently, MakerDAO governance plans to increase the DSR rate to 3.49%. By integrating the DSR into Aave via sDAI, we can allow Aave liquidity providers to benefit from the DSR rate without additional cost to the Aave DAI borrowers.\n\n## Specification\n\nAt the protocol level, when a user deposits DAI, the protocol will wrap their DAI in the form of sDAI and deliver aDAI to the user. When a user borrows DAI, the protocol will unwrap the stored sDAI, deliver DAI, and accrue the debt amount in DAI.\n\n![image|1920x1563, 40%](upload://fQNJl46MrGPtwEuH6Trg6zzyqNP.jpeg)\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis integration will have the consequence of increasing the gas cost of using DAI in Aave for every user. The exact impact of these gas cost increases should be reviewed and considered by the community during the ARFC stage of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK receives positive feedback and a Snapshot vote outcome is YAE, the next step would be to draft an ARFC\ndetailing the technical implementation of this integration.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not paid by makerDAO or any third party to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.\n\nThis integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.\n\nAlongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.\n\nIt's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.\n\nwGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:\n\n- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset, isolation mode, and emode focus asset.\n- wGHO parameters:\n\n| LTV | 77% |\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 80%  |\n| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |\n| Supply Cap | 10M |\n| Borrow Cap | 0 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 10M$ |\n- Create a dedicated stablecoin emode on Aave V3 ETH pool for wGHO, USDC, USDT, DAI, LUSD\n- Emode stablecoin category parameters:\n\n| LTV | 87.5% |\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 90% |\n| Liquidation penalty | 1% |\n\n### Note:\n\nwGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.\n\nOnboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC.

The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The assets considered for this deployment include wETH, wstETH, GNO, USDC, wxDAI, and EURe.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAave & GnosisChain with the upcoming deployment of GnosisPay L2 payment system and GnosisCard product have strategic synergies opportunities. Allowing users to “deposit as collateral, borrow and spend with Gnosis” seamless and near-zero fees experience.\n\nGnosisChain has been a historic actor in the ecosystem, with its roots tracing back to the POA network. \n\nThis proposal builds upon the precedent of synergies between the Aave codebase and the gnosischain as illustrated by the friendly fork RMM Market with RealT, as seen [here](https://rmm.realtoken.network/).\n\nThis “MVP” deployment opens the gates for deeper synergies between the Gnosis & Aave ecosystems in the future.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed deployment on GnosisChain will include the following assets:\n\n| Risk Parameter | wETH | wstETH | GNO | USDC | wxDAI | EURe |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | YES | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | YES | YES | NO | YES | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | NO |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80.5% | 69% | 25% | 77% | 77% | N/A |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 83% | 80% | 28% | 80% | 80% | N/A |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 6% | 10% | 4.5% | 4.5% | N/A |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 15% | N/A | 10% | 10% | 15% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Supply Cap | 7500 wETH | 2000 wsETH | 300000 | 5M USDC | 10M xDAI | 3.5M EURe |\n| Borrow Cap | 7500 wETH | 500 wstETH | N/A | 5M USDC | 10M xDAI | 3.5M EURe |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | 5M$ | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 90% | 45% | N/A | 90% | 90% | 90% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | N/A | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 3.8% | 3.8% | N/A | 3.5% | 5% | 5% |\n| Slope2 | 80% | 80% | N/A | 60% | 60% | 60% |\n\nEven if both assets currently lack the maturity to be considered, the ACI is supportive mid-term of adding both wGHO and sDAI onboarding in the GnosisChain V3 pool.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this TEMP CHECK.\nThe ACI, as an entity, is a customer of Monerium.

The proposed risk parameters for LUSD will mirror those currently in place for USDC on the same pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by users of the Liquity Protocol. It has demonstrated its resilience and maintained a stable peg, even in volatile market conditions. By adding LUSD as a collateral asset on the Aave V3 ETH pool, we can offer our users more options for their DeFi activities. Furthermore, the integration of LUSD could potentially synergize with the GHO, enhancing liquidity and further reinforcing the stability of the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed risk parameters for LUSD on the Aave V3 ETH pool are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 77% |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 80% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 4.5% |\n\nThese parameters are identical to those currently in place for USDC on the Aave V3 ETH pool.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173/13) program, the ACI has not been compensated by any third-party to present this ARFC.\nAt the time of writing, the author does not hold LQTY tokens but owns some LUSD.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP for final approval and implementation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
