As of recent [sDAI](https://app.spark.fi/sdai/) and [sFRAX](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake) have become popular yield bearing stablecoins in the greater defi ecosystem. This proposal is meant to enable four gauges encompassing these tokens on Ethereum and Arbitrum in stable and weighted pools. The pool will sufficiently capture which captures the yield of these tokens and creates routing for the 3 primary stablecoins and wstETH to be swapped against. The pools all will be core for Balancer.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • [Maker Webiste](https://makerdao.com/en/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/makerdao/developerguides/blob/master/dai/dsr-manager-docs/dsr-manager-docs.md)    \n    • [Communities](https://forum.makerdao.com/)\n> Link to: \n    • [Frax Webiste](https://app.frax.finance/)\n    • [Documentation](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-v3/sfrax)\n    • [Github Page](https://github.com/FraxFinance/frax-solidity/blob/master/src/types/constants.ts)    \n    • [Communities](https://gov.frax.finance/)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> sDAI is part of the Maker ecosystem and utilizes the Dai Savings Rate to incentivize users to stake their DAI here https://app.spark.fi/sdai/ . \n>\n>sFRAX is from the new Frax v3 ecosystem and can be utilized [here](https://app.frax.finance/sfrax/stake). \n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer users will have a more capital efficient place to provide stable coin liquidity routes. As core pools these will receive BAL incentives over time via the BIP-19 cycle. sDAI and sFRAX will overall earn the DAO more revenue and strengthen the routing for swaps on Balancer using the underlying tokens.  \n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** Maker DAO is a complex and robust Defi ecosystem. Their current governance module can be seen [here](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module). Frax governance is outlined [here](https://docs.frax.finance/frax-governance/frax-governance-overview). \n\n2. **Oracles:** This pool relies on the [SavingsDAIRateProvider](https://0xc7177B6E18c1Abd725F5b75792e5F7A3bA5DBC2c) to account for the yield accrued by sDAI. This have been reviewed and deemed SAFE by the integrations team [here](https://github.com/threerocks-defi/code-review/blob/main/rate-providers/SavingsDAIRateProvider.md). The sFRAX and wstETH oracles utilize the Chainlink feed factory or have been proven by being utilized for over a year on the platform. \n\n3. **Audits:** MakerDAO audit reports can be seen [here](https://security.makerdao.com/audit-reports). Frax Finance Audits can be seen [here](https://docs.frax.finance/other/audits). \n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** Maker Governance is decentralized and has no apparent centralization vectors. The underlying stablecoins USDT, DAI, and USDC are also exposed to their own centralization risks.\n\n5. **Market History:** sDAI history can be seen on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/savings-dai). sFRAX history can be seen [here](https://www.geckoterminal.com/eth/pools/0xfef79304c80a694dfd9e603d624567d470e1a0e7?utm_source=coingecko&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=searchresults). \n \n6. **Value:** Yield bearing assets increase the value proposition for liquidity providers, and the revenue for the DAO when properly configured. These pools will grow stablecoin and wstETH liquidity for Balancer, while tapping into the yield source of sDAI and sFRAX.\n\nsDAI/3Pool - Mainnet\nPool: [0x49cbD67651fbabCE12d1df18499896ec87BEf46f](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x49cbd67651fbabce12d1df18499896ec87bef46f00000000000000000000064a)\nGauge: [0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4](https://etherscan.io/address/0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4)\n\nsDAI/wstETH - Mainnet\nPool: [0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf1](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x6aa6d7542310cdc75d1179b8729e1e6ec8d42bf100020000000000000000064b)\nGauge: [0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108](https://etherscan.io/address/0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108)\n\nsFRAX/4POOL - Arbitrum \nPool: [0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2CE4457aCac29dA4736aE6f5Cd9F583a6b335c27#readContract)\nChild: [0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x050fBe33699E56B577c3D6f090eCE9870A0966bd)\nRoot: [0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83](https://etherscan.io/address/0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83)\n\nsFRAX/wstETH - Arbitrum\nPool:  [0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f160](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xc757f12694f550d0985ad6e1019c4db4a803f1600002000000000000000004de)\nChild: [0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeBF2d1995f9bBEa5CE689945b87CA4B5a033B653)\nRoot: [0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig eth:`0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments:\ngauge(address): `0xF6A7ad46b00300344C7d4739C0518db70e722DC4`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x94981eB72dB7EBcAE91ABd5A810f34B1DBf21108`\ngaugeType(string): `Ethereum`\n\ngauge(address): `0x62A82FE26E21a8807599374CaC8024fae342eF83`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\ngauge(address): `0xBE0FC6A0cc4eeeB168dfbDA75523c43dFE7D1F9C`\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`\n\nThe pool will have the `core pool` status as per BIP-457",

Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 0.5 basis points, i.e., 0.005% at pool inception. A protocol fee of 30% will be set upon incentives going live. This may be changed later upon mutual discussion (this is a new Rehype pool type and fees and growth may need to be fine tuned). At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n> # References/Useful links\n>\n> * [Documentation of Rehype pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps#description-of-rehype-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n> # Protocol description\n>\n>* stataOptUSDT is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDT. - [Aave](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n> * stataOptUSDCn is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDC.  - [Aave](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n\n\n> # Motivation\n>\n>\n> Rehype pools reach new efficiency heights while staying simple and therefore safer. Rehype pools embrace a simple, modular design that doesn't introduce new smart contract code for rehypothecation. Rehype pools thus inherit the security record of E-CLPs. \n>\n> The complexity of Rehype pools is handled in the more flexible layers of order routing and front end interface instead of in smart contracts.\nAt the same time, they keep everything transparent on-chain and keep users in control, in contrast to common rehypothecation in TradFi.\n>\n\n> # Specifications\n> > ## Governance\n> >\n> >\n> >\n> > The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum.

Rehype Pools auto-rehypothecate E-CLP assets to Aave and can thus accrue yield from three different sources: (1) Aave lending deposit yield, (2) swap yields from asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and (3) yield from third-party token incentive markets.\n> * The pool shall have a swap fee of 0.5 basis points, i.e., 0.005% at pool inception. A protocol fee of 30% will be set upon incentives going live. This may be changed later upon mutual discussion (this is a new Rehype pool type and fees and growth may need to be fine tuned). At pool inception, no fees will go towards Gyroscope.\n\n> # References/Useful links\n> * [Documentation of Rehype pools](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/rehype-e-clps#description-of-rehype-e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n> # Protocol description\n>\n>* stataArbUSDT is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDT on Arbitrum. - [Aave](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n> * stataArbUSDCn is the wrapped, static version of the rebasing Aave lending deposit token for aUSDC on Arbitrum. - [Aave](https://github.com/bgd-labs/static-a-token-v3)\n\n> # Motivation\n>\n> Rehype pools reach new efficiency heights while staying simple and therefore safer. Rehype pools embrace a simple, modular design that doesn't introduce new smart contract code for rehypothecation. Rehype pools thus inherit the security record of E-CLPs.\n> The complexity of Rehype pools is handled in the more flexible layers of order routing and front end interface instead of in smart contracts.\nAt the same time, they keep everything transparent on-chain and keep users in control, in contrast to common rehypothecation in TradFi.\n\n> # Specifications\n> > ## Governance\n> > The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n> > ## Oracles\n> > * rateProvider0 (for stataArbUSDCn): [0x87cD462A781c0ca843EAB131Bf368328848bB6fD](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x87cD462A781c0ca843EAB131Bf368328848bB6fD#readContract)\n> > * rateProvider1 (for stataArbUSDT): [0x48942B49B5bB6f3E1d43c204a3F40a4c5F696ef6](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x48942B49B5bB6f3E1d43c204a3F40a4c5F696ef6#code)\n> > * (allows to control for a price drift from accruing yield by using rate providers to first convert from yield accruing tokens to the underlying)\n> > * Reviews for these rate providers can be verified as SAFE [here](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/pull/34/files#diff-5861d38cee7220a0b2672cd05e4233e4058bdc3c7c0d4aa1f7a5e00979bfee8b). \n>>\n> > ## Audits\n> > Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification for the underlying E-CLP can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports).

This will serve as a 100% yield bearing pair.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n* Website: https://www.renzoprotocol.com\n* Documentation: https://docs.renzoprotocol.com\n* Github: [Renzo-Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/renzo-protocol)\n* Discord: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/renzo)\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/RenzoProtocol\n* $ezETH Token (Arbitrum): [ezETH (Renzo Restaked ETH) Token Tracker | Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5)\n* Dune Dashboards: https://dune.com/maybeYonas/renzo-protocol\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n[$ezETH] is a Liquid Restaking token and Strategy Manager for EigenLayer\n\nRenzo is the interface to the EigenLayer ecosystem securing Actively Validated Services (AVSs), offering a higher yield than ETH staking.\n\nRenzo introduces the Balancer Gauge for the Renzo [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool]. ezETH, Renzo’s liquid restaking token (LRT), captures rewards, ensures liquidity, and simplifies reward management with AVSs. This approach ensures a user-friendly DeFi experience where participants deposit ETH into the liquidity pool, mint ezETH, accumulate rewards, and seamlessly engage in other DeFi activities. Renzo is on a trajectory toward a permissionless validator set, emphasizing composability in DeFi.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nRenzo is seeking to establish the [ezETH/wstETH 50/50 pool] on Arbitrum on Balancer to further enrich liquidity for ezETH. This move aims to enhance the trading experience across the Ethereum ecosystem, making it more accessible for users while generating additional value to the Renzo community.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \nGovernance:\n\nRenzo currently operates with a multi-signature wallet, featuring doxxed founding contributors. The protocol is planning to decentralize strategy management to ezPoints holders and transition to decentralized governance in the future.\n\nOracles:\n\nRenzo uses ChainLink oracles to price assets (besides ETH) held in the protocol, and in the future, ChainLink will also be used to price assets withdrawn from Renzo.\n\nAudits:\n\nRenzo smart contracts have been audited by Halborn. All of Renzo’s smart contracts are open source.Audits can be found here: [https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity Smart Contract Audits/Renzo_Protocol_EVM_Contracts_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity)\n\nCentralization vectors:\n\nCentralization vectors currently revolve around the Oracle, validator management via Figment, upgradeability via proxy multisig contract, and front end hosting.\n\nMarket history:\n\nRenzo currently has two pools live on Balancer [ezETH / WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x596192bb6e41802428ac943d2f1476c1af25cc0e000000000000000000000659) and the [LRT tri-pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x848a5564158d84b8a8fb68ab5d004fae11619a5400000000000000000000066a).

        "body": "[PR with payload](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/72)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n> This pool uses the [ComposableStablePoolFactory-v3](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdba127fbc23fb20f5929c546af220a991b5c6e01#readContract) and is composed of two [Gearbox](https://gearbox.fi/#provide-capital) linear pools. The underlying tokens are USDC and DAI. These will each be wrapped through Gearbox's capital provision market to earn LPs additional yield. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped based on the contents being all large cap stable tokens. Gearbox's diverse lending market permits users to borrow for several use cases making the lending market lucrative and beneficial for Balancer LP's to tap into. Gearbox also allows for lending of various other assets and given this initial case this opens the opportunity for more to come in the future. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Gearbox: Link to:\n> • [Website](https://gearbox.fi/)\n> • [Documentation](https://docs.gearbox.finance/)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol)\n> • [Communities](https://gov.gearbox.fi/)\n> USDC: Link to:\n> • [Website](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)\n> • [Documentation](https://developers.circle.com/docs/what-is-usdc)\n> • [Github Page](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens)\n> • [Communities](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin) - Coingecko link\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Gearbox is a fully composable leverage protocol where users can provide liquidity as a lender for yield. This is where the boosted source of yield is delivered to the wrapped portion of tokens in this pool. On the opposite side of Gearbox's market, users borrow assets in order to leverage up in various Defi protocols to participate in farms, and function is a \"risk-on\" style of investing. USDC is the dollar backed stablecoin issued by Circle. DAI is the decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin by MakerDAO.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> Balancer’s ability to increase capital efficiency using linear and boosted pools is taking shape across the protocol. This Gearbox boosted pool fits Balancer’s initiative to be a protocol where LPs can safely tap into external yield sources, while maintaining effective liquidity for swapping. This will earn both LPs and the DAO yield and provide Idle with a place for their wrapped tokens to easily be swapped and deposited as the pool increases in TVL.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** USDC are centralized and does not have a governance forum. DAI is collateralized by MakerDAO. Gearbox's governance details can be seen [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/governance/setup).\n2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.\n3. **Audits:** See Gearbox's [here](https://docs.gearbox.finance/risk-and-security/audits-bug-bounty)\n4. **Centralization vectors:** USDC is inherently centralized.\n5. **Market History:** See USDC [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/%5D(https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin)). and Gearbox [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gearbox).\n6. **Value:** LPs & Balancer will earn the protocol fee on underlying bb-g-USD as well as swap fees. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.\n\nLink to pool: [0x99c88AD7dc566616548adde8ED3eFfa730eB6C34](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/99C88AD7DC566616548ADDE8ED3EFFA730EB6C3400000000000000000000049A)\nLink to gauge: [0x19A13793af96f534F0027b4b6a3eB699647368e7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x19A13793af96f534F0027b4b6a3eB699647368e7)\n\n### Specification\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with the AuthorizerAdaptor at `0x8F42aDBbA1B16EaAE3BB5754915E0D06059aDd75` and call performAction with the GaugeController at `0xC128468b7Ce63eA702C1f104D55A2566b13D3ABD` for the target(address) argument and using 0x3a04f900 followed by the gauge address `0x19A13793af96f534F0027b4b6a3eB699647368e7` and the corresponding gauge type for the data(bytes) argument.\n\ndata(bytes) : `0x3a04f90000000000000000000000000019a13793af96f534f0027b4b6a3eb699647368e70000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`",
