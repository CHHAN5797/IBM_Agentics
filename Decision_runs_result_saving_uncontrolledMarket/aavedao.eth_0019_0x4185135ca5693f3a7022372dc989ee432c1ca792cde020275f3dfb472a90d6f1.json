        "body": "[TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on Tron\nAuthor: ACI\nDate: 2025-04-18\nSimple Summary\nThis Temp Check seeks the community’s input on the deployment of Aave V3 on Tron Mainnet.\n\nBackground\nTron is the second ranking EVM blockchain in terms of bridged TVL after Ethereum with circa $73bn of value bridged. Almost $69bn of this is stablecoins. We believe that it is time for Aave to deploy on Tron to access this liquidity and allow Tron users to access Aave to earn yield on their stablecoins and borrow against collateral.\n\nMotivation\nAave has deployed on multiple promising new L1 and L2 EVM networks and is often one of the largest protocols on these networks. Tron stands out as a significant opportunity which Aave has previously overlooked, we believe it is time for that to change. It is time for Aave to deploy on the second largest EVM blockchain and allow Aave users the opportunity to access the $69bn of stablecoins and $73bn of bridged value on Tron. This represents a significant opportunity for Aave to grow TVL, revenue, and access a brand new market from which Aave is conspicuously absent.\n\nProof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\nThe Tron DAO has committed to deposit funds at deployment of the instance to bootstrap liquidity.\n\nMore details will be shared at ARFC stage.\n\nSpecification\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Service Providers and this section will be updated at ARFC stage if proposal moves forward, after successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n\nDisclaimer\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The ACI is not directly affiliated with Tron and did not receive any compensation for creating this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], this proposal will be escalated to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Deployment of Aave on zkSync\nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-10\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThe current ARFC proposes deploying Aave V3 on zkSync to leverage the scalability and cost-efficiency of zk-Rollups. By integrating with zkSync, Aave can offer users faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the Ethereum mainnet. This ARFC seeks governance approval for the deployment of an Aave V3 instance on the zkSync Era L2.\n\n## Motivation\n\nzkSync is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that utilizes zk-Rollups to batch multiple transactions off-chain and submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This approach significantly enhances transaction throughput and reduces gas fees. Deposit and borrowing activities can greatly benefit from the reduced transaction costs and increased throughput offered by zkSync.\n\n### Benefits of deploying to zkSync\n\n1. **Reduce Gas Fees:** By leveraging zkSync’s efficient transaction processing, users will incur significantly lower gas fees.\n2. **Scalability:** zkSync’s high throughput will allow Aave to scale effectively, accommodating more users and transactions without compromising performance.\n3. **New Frontier & Opportunities:** This deployment will offer the Aave DAO a new frontier for growth to explore and a new avenue path for GHO, our stablecoin.\n4. **Interoperability:** Due to zkSync infrastructure, an Aave V3 deployment in the zkSync Era can benefit other Aave family products, such as Lens on a segregated layer with GHO, making it a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n1. Aave DAO commits to redistribute to Aave users via liquidity mining, GHO secondary liquidity incentives, safety module deployments, or merit programs any airdrop provided by the zkSync ecosystem.\n2.

        "body": "# [ARFC] Deployment of Aave on Linea\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-11-19\n\n> Risk Parameters have been updated and ARFC has been updated 2024-11-29\n\n## **Simple Summary**\n\nThe current ARFC proposes deploying Aave V3 on Linea to expand Aave’s reach and use cases on zk-Rollups. By integrating with Linea, Aave can offer users more efficient transactions while maintaining the security of the Ethereum mainnet. This ARFC seeks governance approval to deploy an Aave V3 instance on Linea.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nLinea is a Layer 2 built on Ethereum, powered by a zkEVM tech stack developed by Consensys. Linea is the result of more than five years of cryptographic research and 20 months of dedicated R&D. The Consensys team has a strong track record in the zk space, including contributions like the GNARK library and active involvement in Ethereum's Merge. Linea is well-positioned within the developer ecosystem through relationships with MetaMask, SMG, and Infura.\n\nBy deploying on Linea, Aave can leverage high throughput and fast finality, enabling efficient transaction processing and reduced gas fees. Additionally, Linea's integration with Consensys products allows seamless distribution to users, potentially reaching MetaMask's 30 million active users. This presents an opportunity to make DeFi more accessible and expand Aave's user base.\n\nLinea’s TVL currently sits at ~$780M. Further Linea market data can be found [here.](https://defillama.com/chain/Linea)\n\n### **Benefits of deploying to Linea**\n\n1. **Scalability and Performance**: Linea enables high throughput and fast finality for zk networks, allowing Aave to scale effectively alongside Linea as its technology advances.\n2. **Accessibility and Distribution**: Linea is integrated with Consensys products like MetaMask, and Infura, facilitating seamless distribution to users and making DeFi more accessible to MetaMask's 30 million active users.\n3. **GHO Integration**: Upon successful deployment and bootstrapping of Aave on Linea, the Consensys team is motivated to enable GHO, Aave's stablecoin, to be spendable on the [MetaMask Debit Card](https://metamask.io/news/latest/introducing-metamask-card-upgrade-your-crypto-spending/), which is exclusively available on Linea.\n4. **Growth Opportunities**: With exciting growth catalysts for Linea in the upcoming H1, establishing Aave as the premier lending market on Linea will ensure long-term sustainability and growth for the Aave protocol.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\n1. Aave DAO commits to redistribute to Aave users via liquidity mining, GHO secondary liquidity incentives, safety module deployments, or merit programs any airdrop provided by the Linea ecosystem.\n2. ACI, on behalf of the Aave DAO, will coordinate any liquidity mining campaign on a Linea Aave V3 deployment.\n\n### **Risk Parameters**\n\nRisk parameters will be provided by service providers and this section will be updated in due course.\n\n| Asset | Supply on Linea | Marketcap on Linea | Volume | Liquidity | Lineascan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WETH | 22,800 | $78,9M | $18.15M | $11.7M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0xe5d7c2a44ffddf6b295a15c148167daaaf5cf34f) |\n| weETH | 22,900 | $83,3M | $2.5M | $5.1M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0x1bf74c010e6320bab11e2e5a532b5ac15e0b8aa6) |\n| ezETH | 34,600 | $124,4M | $4.9M | $12.1M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5) |\n| wstETH | 2,500 | $10,2M | $85,000 | $4.6M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0xb5bedd42000b71fdde22d3ee8a79bd49a568fc8f) |\n| WBTC | 220 | $20,2M | $2.7M | $3.6M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0x3aab2285ddcddad8edf438c1bab47e1a9d05a9b4) |\n| USDC.e | 28,700,000 | $28,7M | $4.7M | $8.8M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0x176211869ca2b568f2a7d4ee941e073a821ee1ff) |\n| USDT | 10,400,000 | $10,4M | $7.3M | $9.9M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0xa219439258ca9da29e9cc4ce5596924745e12b93) |\n\n|  | WETH | wstETH | ezETH | weETH | WBTC | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |\n| Enable Borrow | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Enable Collateral | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 75% | 72% | 72.5% | 73% | 75% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 83% | 79% | 75% | 75% | 78% | 78% | 78% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 6% | 7% | 7.5% | 7.5% | 7% | 5% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 5% | 45% | 45% | 20% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Supply Cap | 1,200 | 800 | 1,200 | 1,200 | 25 | 12,000,000 | 7,800,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,100 | 400 | 600 | 600 | 12.5 | 11,000,000 | 7,150,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| UOptimal | 90% | 45% | 45% | 45% | 45% | 90% | 90% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 2.7% | 7% | 7% | 7% | 7% | 5.5% | 5.5% |\n| Slope2 | 80% | 300% | 300% | 300% | 300% | 60% | 60% |\n| Stable Borrowing | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |\n| Flashloanable | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| E-Mode Category | Ethereum Correlated | Ethereum Correlated, wstETH/WETH | Ethereum Correlated | Ethereum Correlated | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n\n**ETH-Correlated E-Mode**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | WETH | wstETH | weETH | ezETH |\n| Collateral | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes | No | No | No |\n| Max LTV | 90% | 90% | 90% | 90% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93% | 93% | 93% | 93% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n**wstETH/WETH E-Mode**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | WETH | wstETH |\n| Collateral | No | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes | No |\n| Max LTV | 93.5% | 93.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95.5% | 95.5% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n- [Linea Website](http://linea.build/)\n- [Lineascan](https://lineascan.build/)\n- [Linea Docs](https://docs.linea.build/)\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy whitelabel Aave V3 Market - Reental \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-26\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\nThe current proposal aims to deploy a “whitelabel” version of Aave V3 for Reental tokens on the Polygon network. By allowing friendly forks of Aave V3, Aave can increase its technology adoption and provide an alternative source of revenue and synergies for the DAO and third-party teams.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nReental, in collaboration with Reental Master LLC, a protocol offering utility and functionalities associated with the Real World Assets (RWA) market, aims to deploy its collateralization market (ReenLever) on Aave's V3 platform. Reental stands as a global leader with extensive experience in real estate asset tokenization, having tokenized over $46 million across four countries on three continents. It uniquely combines these security tokens with its own utility token ($RNT), delivering significant benefits to its community of over 16,000 investors.\n\nReental is a key player in the global tokenization of RWAs, specifically in the real estate market. It offers investment opportunities in real estate assets to users worldwide. Currently, Reental has tokenized over 65 properties across four countries (USA, Spain, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic), totaling $25 million, with a community of 16,000 users from over 80 countries. \n\nWith this track record, Reental stands as the only company worldwide with tokenized properties across four countries on three continents, aspiring to become a global entity with properties tokenized worldwide and partnerships with some of the sector's most prominent corporations: Civitas, Grupo ClerHP, Grupo BEC, M2Capital, Sibarys Capital, and others. \n\nIn addition to its demonstrated traction as a leader in the Spanish-speaking RWA market over the past three years, Reental recently launched its utility token: $RNT. This tool enables the community to actively participate in the protocol, foster mutual growth, and transform user investors into stakeholders, creating a virtuous growth cycle.\n\n### Specification\n\nWe are witnessing a highly favorable trend and narrative regarding RWAs, and Aave can maintain its leadership by embracing the unstoppable growth of this ecosystem. Reental can contribute to this growth with its collateralized lending market.\n\nReental proposes launching a whitelisted Aave V3 instance, bringing along the current $46 million tokenized volume, which could be collateralized immediately, and the potential for billions more in the coming years.\n\n20% of the generated fees will be allocated to the Aave DAO. While the Reental market is not currently a significant business prospect for the Aave DAO, and it is not expected to be a significant revenue driver, the market has an interesting value proposition for off-chain collateral-based liquidity protocols.\n\nThis integration bridges the off-chain world with the on-chain realm through these RWAs, which are already yielding returns for investors.\n\nReental will assume the role of risk admin for this market, adding new properties monthly.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Www.reental.co](https://www.reental.co/)\n\nhttps://dapp.reental.co/\n\nhttps://assets-global.website-files.com/64883b1804f368bf8575ed2e/660eabf219338236d77f325f_White_Paper_Reental_V_1.0_-_ENG_3.pdf\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Rentaal and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
