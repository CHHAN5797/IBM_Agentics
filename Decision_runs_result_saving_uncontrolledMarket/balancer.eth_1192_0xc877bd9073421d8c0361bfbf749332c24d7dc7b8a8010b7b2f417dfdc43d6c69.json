This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (July 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a separate proposal. Our primary roles include API team lead (@franzns), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). \n\n@Fernando's recent [post](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-v3-my-thoughts-for-the-future-of-balancer/5801) outlines a product vision for Balancer v3, a vision that all technical teams have spent the last six months working to build out. As we approach feature complete and prepare to release the codebase to the wider public, we move steadily closer to bringing v3 to market.\n\nThe following statement from our previous proposal remains as relevant today as it was six months ago:\n> The upcoming release of Balancer v3 presents an opportunity for Balancer to regain narrative and establish ourselves as the platform to empower current and future AMM innovation. We are hugely optimistic in the future of Balancer Protocol and steadfast in our dedication to support the ecosystem to the best of our abilities. As we work towards Balancer v3, it has been inspiring to participate in the development of a more cohesive technology stack to empower the future of the protocol. A technology stack that leverages the collective experiences and expertise of contributors across the ecosystem, avoiding siloed development strategies that lead to unnecessary system complexity in Balancer v2.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broad technical ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. We welcome community feedback.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nAs of January 2024, Three Rocks wound down their operations and all responsibilities transitioned to Balancer Labs under the leadership of John Grant. Despite a reduction in team size, the new integrations team has proven themselves more than capable of stepping up to the challenge. Below is a list of the major initiatives and projects that the integrations team has taken on over the last six months:\n\n- **Rate provider reviews** - @Marcus and @Mkflow27 have successfully introduced a structured internal process to manage rate provider reviews that has created transparency, clear deadlines and improved turnaround time dramatically. The positive impact has been felt across the entire ecosystem.\n- **Aggregator / Solver relations** - The success of Balancer v3 will be tightly coupled to our ability to get v3 liquidity integrated into the broader liquidity landscape. @lipman and John Grant have spent the last several month building bridges to all aggregators and solvers in our network. Getting them early access to the v3 codebase and documentation, and doing whatever they can to ensure that v3 liquidity will have aggregator support from day one.\n- **V3 Docs** - While conducting extensive interviews with partners, documentation was identified as one of the weakest points of Balancer v2. The integrations team, lead by mkflow, has taken ownership over the v3 docs, and has invested significant energy to ensure that v3 will launch with robust documentation, with a focus on easy to use guides for integrators and builders.\n- **Balancer Maths** - A lightweight multi-language repository that will contain invariant implementations for all known Balancer pools. By providing invariant implementations in commonly used programming languages (typescript, python, rust), this repository will serve as a reference point for any teams that require off-chain computation of pool maths (ie: aggregators and solvers).\n- **Scaffold Balancer** - Funded as a grant in partnership with the [BuidlGuidl](https://buidlguidl.com/), Scaffold Balancer will serve as a toolkit for developers looking to build custom AMMs or Hooks on Balancer v3. Based on the popular [scaffold-eth](https://scaffoldeth.io/), Scaffold Balancer provides an interactive UI that allows developers to build, deploy and interact with custom AMMs and hooks. Our goal is for Balancer v3 to become the destination for AMM experimentation and innovation.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nBalancer v3 has been the core focus of the Smart Contracts team for the entire last two quarters, and we are rapidly approaching feature complete. While an exact date has not been set, we expect to release the code base within the next 6 weeks, giving the general public an opportunity to provide feedback prior to freezing the code and starting formal audits. While the v3 development cycle has extended beyond what we had initially planned, the additional time was necessary to iterate on core features until we found an optimal solution.\n\nAs always, it has been a pleasure collaborating closely with @juani, @endymionjkb, @joaobrunoah and Elshan over the last six months. I think I can speak for the entire team when I say that we’re very much looking forward to sharing more details on Balancer v3 over the coming months.\n\n**SDK**\n\nThe new [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) is now feature complete for Balancer v2, with v3 support well underway and on track to be feature complete prior to v3 rollout. In contrast to the existing [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk), the new b-sdk is highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API, allowing the SDK to be focused in its goals. In line with that goal, the Smart Order Router (SOR) has been migrated from the SDK to the API, which can leverage data caching to ensure fresh quotes and fast response times. With the reduction in scope, the SDK team have already become active contributors to the API and will transition into supporting integrations in the mid-term.\n\n**Frontend**\n\nDubbed internally Project Zen, the new Balancer Frontend is undergoing active testing in a [closed beta](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1796274392739274806) prior to a public launch in early July. As a quick recap, the new Balancer Frontend is:\n\n- Multi-chain native to facilitate exploration of liquidity pools across all Balancer supported networks.\n- Statically rendered and API powered to enable blazing fast load times\n- Beautifully designed, adopting the new “Zen” themed rebrand that will be unveiled in the coming weeks.\n- Version agnostic, supporting all v2 pools with v3 support underway.\n- Designed with a flexible architecture, highlighted by it’s ability to easily support v2, v3 and the new CoW AMM pools\n\nLed by @gareth, OpCo and Beethoven X contributors have rebuilt the Balancer App from the ground up, leveraging their extensive Balancer domain knowledge to build a better product that will serve the ecosystem for the coming years.\n\n**Subgraph / Data**\n\nThe development of the v3 subgraph has continued in lock-step with the smart contracts. Led by @mendesfabio, the data team has done a great job of reducing the subgraph’s scope, migrating from a monolithic design that attempted to solve all problems, to a modular design focused primarily on data extraction. This revised approach allows the API to manage data transformation, providing a granular level of control that will result in improved data quality across the ecosystem.\n\nBy separating vault from pools, the modular approach to the v3 subgraph aims to reduce lengthy subgraph redeployments that have been bottlenecks to new pool type development on v2. Rather than redeploying a singular monolithic subgraph, a new pool type will only require the deployment of a pools subgraph that will be significantly lighter weight.\n\nTo support new pool type development by external teams, the data team has developed a CLI tool that will manage much of the scaffolding for developers when looking to include their newly developed pool types to the Balancer Pools Subgraph.\n\nOutside of subgraph development, the data team remains committed to the development of high quality dune dashboard and reusable spells, highlighted by the [Balancer dune org](https://dune.com/balancer) recently passing 1,000 stars. Additionally, the data team has been engaged with external data providers working to ensure the consistency of Balancer data across the broader ecosystem, and has begun engaging with Hypernative (SP) to ensure high quality system monitoring is in place for v3 launch.\n\n**API**\n\nBelow, we present general API updates, written by Beethoven X DAO contributor franz, API team lead:\n\nIn the first half of 2024, our main focus has been on enhancing the API and streamlining processes to meet the needs of the upcoming Zen UI and Balancer V3. We achieved several important milestones during this period.\n\nThe API is now ready to serve the needs of the new UI. We’ve worked closely with OpCo to ensure all their needs are satisfied. We continued to improve the new API on various fronts. For example, we restructured the database to support more historical data, including swaps, liquidity additions and removals, pool snapshots, and token pricing. This allows for more comprehensive data analysis and reporting. The new Smart Order Router has also been fully integrated now and improved order routing efficiency across the platform. Throughout these efforts, maintaining backward compatibility has been a priority to ensure uninterrupted service for existing users.\n\nOptimizing the allow listing process for tokens, pools, and gauges was another significant and important task. We’ve analyzed the current process end-to-end and were able to find several inefficiencies. The implementation of the new process has reduced manual work, making it more efficient and less error-prone for both Balancer Maxis as well as OpCo. This process will continue to be optimized with the new Balancer UI.\n\nAdditional integration efforts included adding support for COWAMM which is a new AMM primitive developed in partnership with Cow Swap. In addition, integration for the new Balancer Vault V3 has started and is progressing alongside the Smart Contract development. We also integrated Mode and Fraxtal to support the launch of Balancer on those networks.\n\nWe also reviewed and fixed the token terminal reporting of revenue for all Balancer chains, ensuring accurate financial reporting. Additionally, we worked with DEX Screener to integrate Balancer Pools properly into their App. Support is not yet live for all chains, but they are in the works.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n- **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting July 1, 2024 and ending December 31, 2024.\n\nWe request to extend the existing budget of $29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

This proposal aims to extend the technical services and advisory component for an additional 6 months (January 1, 2024 - June 30, 2024). As in the previous proposals, marketing services provided by the Beethoven X DAO are submitted as a [separate proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xx-funding-proposal-for-the-beethoven-x-dao-marketing-sp-jan-jun-24/5406).\n\nOur primary roles include API team lead (franz), frontend contributor (groninge) and ecosystem technical lead (daniel). While the past nine months have been turbulent at times, we strongly believe it has once again demonstrated the resilience of the Balancer DAO and the entire ecosystem. Despite a [key service provider winding down](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/rfc-orb-collective-s-path-forward/4778), several core contributors stepping down, and a [critical vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-found-in-some-pools/5102), we are collectively still here, building.\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for Balancer to regain narrative and establish ourselves as the platform to empower current and future AMM innovation. We are hugely optimistic in the future of Balancer Protocol and steadfast in our dedication to support the ecosystem to the best of our abilities. As we work towards Balancer V3, it has been inspiring to participate in the development of a more cohesive technology stack to empower the future of the protocol. A technology stack that leverages the collective experiences and expertise of contributors across the ecosystem, avoiding siloed development strategies that lead to unnecessary system complexity in Balancer V2.\n\nAs we operate as a small part of a much larger system, our successes are enabled by many across the ecosystem. As such, we present a broader ecosystem update below that touches on our specific contributions when relevant. As we continue to find the best way to bring value to the Balancer ecosystem, we welcome community feedback.\n\n**Integrations**\n\nThree Rocks recently [announced](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/integrations-team-three-rocks-november-2023-update/5408) their decision to wind down effective December 2023. Both @rabmarut and @gerg have been long time contributors to the Balancer ecosystem. We’d like to extend a thank you to the entire Three Rocks organization, they are a team of talented engineers who made countless contributions to the protocol as well as serving as the technical interface to external partners, they will be missed. \n\nOver the last few months, there has been ecosystem wide discussions around the future of integrations at Balancer, resulting in with what we see as a very positive outcome to a challenging situation. Effective January 2024, the responsibilities of the integrations team will transition to Balancer Labs under the leadership of John Grant. With John Grant’s extensive knowledge of the entire Balancer ecosystem and the support of existing Three Rocks team member @Mkflow27, integrations will become a part of what is currently the Balancer Labs SDK team. With expertise in both on- and off-chain integrations into Balancer Protocol, we see this team as being well suited to fill the gap left by Three Rocks. While John is on a well deserved parental leave, I have been working directly with mkflow to help facilitate a smooth transition.\n\nWe’d additionally like to extend a huge thanks to Fernando and the entire Balancer Labs team for their willingness to take on the responsibilities and costs for integrations moving forward. This significantly reduces the operational costs incurred by the DAO, and is yet another example of Balancer Labs' ongoing commitment to the long-term success of the Balancer protocol.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nBalancer V3 has been the core focus of the Smart Contracts team for the majority of the last two quarters. While the feature set has not yet been publicly disclosed, we are extremely excited about the technical direction of Balancer V3. Architecturally speaking, there has been a focus on:\n\n- Interface design - with the overarching goal of making it significantly easier to integrate with Balancer protocol.\n- Reducing overall system complexity\n- Improved code readability by reducing inheritance depth and leveraging libraries for composition.\n\nInternally, the smart contracts team is on track to complete its second major milestone at the end of this year, a first MVP of the core contracts of Balancer V3. It has been an absolute pleasure collaborating closely with @juani, @endymionjkb and @ylv. I think I can speak for the entire team when I say that we’re very much looking forward to sharing more details on Balancer V3 publicly.\n\n**SDK**\n\nProgress on the new [b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) has continued over the past two quarters, and it is fast approaching feature complete for Balancer V2. In contrast to the existing [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk), the new b-sdk is highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. Data intensive operations are now delegated to the Balancer API, allowing the SDK to be focused in its goals. The SDK team has additionally been a huge contributor in interface design for Balancer V3, their in-depth understandings of V2 integration pain points have been invaluable in the process.\n\nAn important initiative worth highlighting is the cross-organizational effort to implement a generalized approach for [price impact calculations](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk/blob/d8dc287253160d20c877a57ac4c4c60190b22770/src/entities/priceImpact/index.ts) in the b-sdk. Spearheaded by @brunoguerios from the SDK team and @ZenDragon from the Maxis, their efforts have produced a first iteration of a generalized approach that will reliably calculate price impact for all pool actions, irrespective of the underlying invariant implementation. This is a massively valuable development for the entire ecosystem.\n\n**Frontend**\n\nThe upcoming release of Balancer V3 presents an opportunity for a new take on the existing frontend application. OpCo and Beethoven X contributors have spent the last several months laying the groundwork on a new version of the Balancer Frontend. With a fresh new look, the new Balancer Product will be:\n\n- Multi-chain native to allow for quick exploration of liquidity pools across all Balancer supported networks.\n- API powered to facilitate fast loading times, overcoming many of the data challenges plaguing the current V2 application.\n- Version agnostic to ensure that any liquidity that stays on V2 will benefit from the streamlined UX.\n- Designed with a flexible architecture, with the goal to easily support all current and future pool types.\n\nLed by @gareth, OpCo and Beethoven X contributors are collectively leveraging their extensive Balancer domain knowledge to build a better product.\n\n**API**\n\nAs the limitations of the subgraph have been a constant bottleneck for V2, the Balancer Labs Data team, lead by @mendesfabio, have made the decision that future versions of the Balancer subgraph will be focused primarily on data extraction (E). This is in recognition that the API is better suited for the role of data transformation (T) and loading (L). As the API will play an important role in the Balancer tech stack, former SDK team member Jarek has transitioned to the API team and we expect that there will be a close collaboration between the API and Data teams as we move towards Balancer V3.\n\nBelow, we present general API updates, written by Beethoven X DAO contributor franz, API team lead:\n\nOver the last months, our main effort went into getting the API ready for the new frontend-v3 and the b-sdk. As the frontend aims to serve a multi-chain user experience, the API must also support these requirements. Working closely together with OpCo, requirements for queries have been defined and implemented one-by-one as they are needed in the development process. \n\nMany other, smaller changes have also been integrated into the API to support data needs for the new frontend such as specific filters, rate provider data, FX pools support or yield fee specifics.\n\nAdditionally, the API is also used in the new b-sdk to “enrich” pool data that is being used for various pool operations. Together with Balancer Labs we defined the requirements for the API and integrated the changes. These requirements mainly comprise specific needs on nested pools, token indexes or other token data.\n\nAdditional points of interest:\n\n- In August, BASE chain was integrated into the API which is responsible for serving pricing data to the UI.\n- Optimizations have been made to the infrastructure deployment that resulted in a more cost effective solution. In addition, more changes are planned that should further reduce the cost of operating the infrastructure.\n- On November 27th, we successfully deprecated the veBal voting-gauges.json file in GitHub in favor of the API. All known partners have migrated and will query the API in the future. With this change we automate a manual operations task, reducing manual work.\n- We have helped the community in Discord with questions regarding development, inner workings of the UI and API, to help them understand the liquidity mining or voting processes from Balancer and with general questions.\n- We’ve supported the Balancer Maxis with their data needs for the gauge rewards automation program. Also, showcasing the rich data set that the API has on Balancer pools and how to make use of it.\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort. How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n- **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\n\nBeethoven X DAO is requesting 6 months of funding starting January 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2023.\n\nWe request a budget of $29,000 USDC per month for technical development and advisory. The increase of $4,000 USDC per month reflects increased involvement from groninge on the development of the new v3 frontend.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

This proposal seeks to extend the technical services and advisory component of the original proposal for an additional 5 month period (August 1, 2023 - December 31, 2023). As outlined in [BIP-314](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810), the marketing component of [BIP-254](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-254-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao/4652) will appear as a separate proposal moving forward. \n\nThe following sections present a summary of where we spent our time and energy over the last 10 weeks. As we continue to find the best way to bring value to the Balancer ecosystem, we welcome community feedback.\n\n**API**\n\nThe new [Balancer API](https://api-v3.balancer.fi/) is production ready, supporting all Balancer and Beethoven X chains. Built to alleviate many of the data sourcing issues plaguing the balancer frontend, this new API leverages the [beethovenx-backend](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/beethovenx-backend/) codebase and is deployed on unified infrastructure. This joint deployment cuts operational costs and allows us to tap into individual domain expertise more effectively.\n\nAs the API will become a critical piece of infrastructure for Balancer protocol, we dedicated substantial effort to enhancing monitoring and ensuring operational resilience. To improve error visibility, we implemented various alerting mechanisms and notification services, enabling us to identify and address any potential issues before they affect users. Additionally, we created a status page ([Dashboard](https://cloudwatch.amazonaws.com/dashboard.html?dashboard=status-page-main-share&context=eyJSIjoidXMtZWFzdC0xIiwiRCI6ImN3LWRiLTExODY5NzgwMTg4MSIsIlUiOiJ1cy1lYXN0LTFfNkhUUlp3VENaIiwiQyI6IjRlazJtOHJvMXRxYWI5NTdpazJwMG9odTNmIiwiSSI6InVzLWVhc3QtMTo5OThhODFjZC0xYWJhLTRkNmItYjBlNi1iYTJmMzk2YzM5YTMiLCJPIjoiYXJuOmF3czppYW06OjExODY5NzgwMTg4MTpyb2xlL3NlcnZpY2Utcm9sZS9DV0RCU2hhcmluZy1QdWJsaWNSZWFkT25seUFjY2Vzcy1UUEg1NEpVWSIsIk0iOiJQdWJsaWMifQ%3D%3D&start=PT3H&end=null)) that provides real-time infrastructure status for anyone to monitor.\n\nTo strengthen the resiliency of the API, we implemented several measures, most notably integrating caching infrastructure and adding rate limits. Furthermore, the deployment architecture is designed to scale automatically based on demand. These implementations ensure that the API can reliably and efficiently handle requests, leading to a fast and seamless user experience.\n\nBeyond infrastructure changes, we’ve collaborated closely with contributors from OpCo and Balancer Labs to further enhance the API and align it with the requirements of the Balancer Protocol.\n\n- Leveraging the token pricing mechanism of the API, OpCo successfully improved pricing reliability on the frontend. It proved particularly valuable during the ZKEVM deployment, where Coingecko lacked many token prices.\n- The API is now used to provide real-time \"marketing stats\" on the Balancer landing page, aggregating total volume, fees, and TVL across all chains efficiently.\n- In collaboration with OpCo, we’ve started integrating the veBAL voting list into the API, leading us to uncover and optimize inefficiencies in the voting gauge addition process. By streamlining and automating these processes, we can significantly enhance their efficiency by reducing manual work.\n- Working closely with the SDK team, we’ve started to integrate the new version of the [SOR](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) into the API. Leveraging our existing production deployment and the API's capabilities, we are able to test the new SOR algorithm using real-time swap data. This approach allows us to evaluate the efficiency and speed of the swap, helping us improve the SOR code and achieve optimal outcomes.\n\nThrough collaboration, enhanced infrastructure, and integration efforts, we have established a robust and reliable API that caters to the needs of both Balancer and Beethoven X. However, we recognize that this is just the beginning of our journey.\n\n**Technical Advisory**\n\nA key takeaway from the initial engagement period facilitated by Balancer Labs is that the role I (daniel) am best suited to fill is not only as a builder but as an advisor across the technical landscape, working to ensure that the various engineering teams in the ecosystem build cohesive technology that is aligned with the overall Balancer product vision.\n\nOutlined below is where I’ve spent the bulk of my time and energy, although I would emphasize that I am just one part of a larger conversation. I’m hugely thankful for everyone’s openness in engaging with me on these topics.\n\n**Smart Contracts**\n\nOne common criticism of Balancer protocol smart contracts is that they are difficult to interact with and even harder to understand. Although the smart contract team does an incredible job of documenting their contracts, there is a collective agreement that we can improve their ease-of-use and readability.\n\nThere is real value in “giving people what they’re used to” as a means to facilitate adoption. While the Balancer V2 interfaces make sense in the context of balancer, they introduce domain specific knowledge that create hurdles for adoption. We’ve started working on a simple set of interfaces that more closely align with the standards set by Uni V2. These interfaces will provide an alternative to the existing full-fledged options (`batchSwap, joinPool, exitPool`).\n\nWhile inheritance is the core design pattern available when organizing smart contracts, deep inheritance comes at the tradeoff of readability. The use of libraries has been presented as an alternative to inheritance (where appropriate). When a library function is called, it’s immediately obvious where that function is defined, and thus easier to understand and reason about. It more closely tracks the principle of *composition over inheritance*.\n\n**SDK**\n\nTo date, the [Balancer SDK](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-sdk) has been built primarily to facilitate the needs of the [Balancer Frontend](https://github.com/balancer/frontend-v2). The introduction of the [B-SDK](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk) and [Balancer API](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/beethovenx-backend/) present an opportunity for us to redefine it’s role in the broader tech stack. It allows us to ask the question: “What role should the Balancer SDK play in facilitating/furthering the overall vision of Balancer Protocol?”\n\nIn answering this question, we’ve worked on identifying the various user groups of the Balancer SDK and prioritizing their needs. This has allowed us to more clearly define that the Balancer SDK should be a tool highly focused on facilitating on-chain interactions with the Balancer Protocol. The Balancer API will serve as the data hub for the protocol, allowing us to move much of the data responsibilities out of the SDK and into the API.\n\nActive initiatives:\n\n- The new SOR (implemented in the B-SDK) has been integrated into the API, allowing for side-by-side testing of the routing algorithms without adding additional computational load to the frontend.\n- Various read-only helper contracts are in development: [1](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/pull/2521), [2](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-deployments/pull/54), [3](https://github.com/balancer/helpers). These contracts will significantly reduce the complexity of off-chain data processing, providing accessible on-chain tooling for common data requirements. This aligns with an over arching goal to push more data complexity (where it makes sense) on-chain.\n- @brunoguerios from the SDK team has started porting additional pool type math to the new B-SDK SOR, leveraging the computationally superior bigint math.\n\n**Frontend (Product)**\n\nThe change from “frontend” to “product” represents a subtle but important shift in how we think about the Balancer frontend. Some general thoughts on a Balancer Product vision are presented [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-opco-year-two/4882/22). @gareth and I continue to have an ongoing conversation focused on how we can build a better Balancer Product both technically and within it’s role in facilitating the growth and adoption of the Balancer Protocol.\n\nIn an effort to ensure that we are constantly improving the existing UX, we’ve begun to set up a process that creates visibility around issues in the existing balancer frontend. Our goal is to use existing tools to measure user issues when interacting with the balancer frontend, and work towards reducing these occurrences over time.\n\n**Composable Stable Pool Vulnerability Support**\n\nThe [vulnerability disclosure on June 25th](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1672635756005957633) has impacted protocol fee collection on all composable stable pools, a core revenue driver for the protocol. As resolution of this issue was deemed critically important, I’ve invested a significant portion of the last two weeks supporting @juani and @Fernando in identifying the underlying issue and working towards a resolution. As someone familiar with the composable stable pool protocol fee collection mechanism, my participation here made sense from a resource allocation perspective, and has allowed the remainder of the smart contract team to continue progressing on existing projects.\n\n**Marketing Transition Support**\n\nAlthough not a typical technical service, when the Orb Collective [abruptly wound down support for marketing services](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-april-2023-high-level-updates/4735) and [released all marketing personnel](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-updated-q2-budget-forecast-5-12-23/4775), I stepped in to facilitate a smooth transition of marketing related responsibilities to [Beethoven X contributors](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-314-funding-proposal-for-beethoven-x-dao-marketing/4810). \n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:**\n\n- **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n- **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort.

Recognizing this, both Balancer and Beethoven X have continually expressed a desire to work closer together.\n\nIn an effort to accelerate the collaboration, Balancer Labs engaged Beethoven X contributors in a 3-month trial contract beginning on February 1, 2023. This collaboration has allowed both teams to leverage each other's strengths and work together to drive technical innovation for the Balancer DAO.\n\nAs Balancer pursues its path towards further decentralization, we believe the inclusion of the Beethoven X DAO in its pool of service providers would represent a significant step in furthering this goal.\n\nIn this proposal, we will provide an update on the progress of the collaboration and present our plans for the future. We believe that by working collaboratively, we can achieve greater efficiency and drive innovation for the benefit of the entire Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Balancer API**\n\nBeethoven X launched a custom UI in August 2022, with the goal of providing a fast and smooth user experience. To facilitate this goal, a significant amount of energy and resources were invested into the development of a custom backend API.\n\n[https://github.com/beethovenxfi/beethovenx-backend/](https://github.com/beethovenxfi/beethovenx-backend/)\n\nWhile OpCo has also been in the process of developing their own API, it was recognized that the Beethoven X API is in a more mature state and both sides would benefit from collectively supporting and building on a single API moving forward. Over the last two months, members from OpCo, Balancer Labs and Beethoven X have worked collaboratively to deploy a joint API infrastructure that will service both Balancer and Beethoven X moving forward:\n\n[https://api-v3.balancer.fi/](https://api-v3.balancer.fi/)\n\nOpCo has started the process of integrating the API into the Balancer UI, which should serve to provide a smoother UX in many ways. The success of this project speaks to the collaborative nature of all teams involved.\n\n**Scaffold-balancer**\n\nAs part of the roadmap planning for Q1 of 2023, Beethoven X contributors proposed the development of a suite of tools that could make it significantly easier to start developing a custom pool contract on top of the Balancer protocol.\n\n[https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer](https://github.com/balancer/scaffold-balancer)\n\nScaffold-balancer is a fork of the well known scaffold-eth project geared specifically around facilitating the rapid prototyping of new Balancer pool types. We strongly believe that if we make it simple to get started and succeed early, it will provide developers the motivation and inspiration to slowly peel back the layers of complexity that is the Balancer protocol and develop something truly innovative.\n\nCurrent feature set:\n\n* Generic Pool UI - Allows you to interact with any existing or locally deployed pool contracts, making the time-to-test significantly shorter. The UI focuses on single contract actions (swap/join/exit) for both query and tx submission.\n* SOR Playground - Provides granular config on the pools, tokens, types, etc that are included into the routing. The idea being that you can provide tight constraints around the dataset to see how your custom pool performs when benchmarked against existing liquidity, although it could also quite easily be used to benchmark the performance of the SOR generally.\n* Batchswap builder - A UI for building arbitrarily complex batch swaps.\n\nBeyond the initially developed feature set, João from Orb integrations has also started to build out [managed pool controller examples inside scaffold-balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/orb-collective-march-2023-integrations-update/4613).\n\nWhile still in its infancy, we believe this tool already provides significant value to developers looking to start the journey of developing their own custom pool on Balancer.\n\n**SDK / SOR**\n\nThe existing SOR was built before the widespread adoption of BigInt math and the advent of boosted pools. As the number of deployed pools has continued to grow, the existing SOR has come up against performance limitations. Mike McDonald recently initiated a project to rewrite the SOR with a focus on speed and performance. We’ve supported Mike in this process, including implementing a novel graph traversal algorithm for path finding that is boosted pool native.\n\n[https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk](https://github.com/balancer/b-sdk)\n\nThe implementation of a robust API has presented an opportunity to rethink the role that the Balancer SDK should fill. This repo will become the home of the new Balancer SDK.\n\n**Technical Advisor**\n\nWhile I (daniel) am a builder at heart, I’ve worked in senior developer and CTO roles for the better part of 10 years, and have worked professionally as a software developer for 15 years. The Balancer Labs leadership has been incredibly open and allowed me to begin to play a larger role across the entire ecosystem. Over the last several months, I’ve started attending regular ecosystem meetings, engaged in conversations on product development, participated in partnership discussions, and taken a role in helping to collaboratively define the future of the Balancer SDK.\n\n**Marketing, content and design**\n\nOver the past 18 months the Beethoven X marketing team have established a brand that has come to be recognised for not only its unique personality but its approach to community building and content creation. Our goal has been to build a competent community of engaged users that are as passionate about our ecosystem as we are.\n\nThe focus for our marketing efforts has been centered around producing high quality educational material on the underlying technology as well as cultivating an ethos of care and compassion for our community. Combining a strong visual aesthetic with an approachable brand identity has allowed our content, voice and style to flourish and has cemented our place as one of the top DeFi protocols on Fantom and Optimism.\n\nWeekly newsletters, threads, docs, NFTs, giveaways, community competitions, animations, long form articles, ambassador programs, live events, and financial reporting has enabled community members to keep up to date with the Beethoven X ecosystem.\n\nBuilding from a foundation of innovation that intertwines within current trends, social narratives and symbiosis offers the opportunity to establish a flourishing community base that is educated and empowered to engage in the ecosystem.\n\nWhile not part of the original agreement, we set forth to showcase this competency. For the past 3 months the marketing team has started to work on the following initiatives.\n\n**Landing Page**\n\nAs part of the roadmap planning for Q1 2023, Beethoven X contributors proposed the development of a landing page that clearly, concisely and with strong visuals, answers the question that is at the center of the growth of Balancer as a platform. “Why should I build on Balancer?” To date, 10 in-depth interviews have been performed with developers and key contributors across the Balancer ecosystem, and work has begun on developing a cohesive storyline. The landing page will intertwine strong visual design with technical information to create an engaging experience that highlights what sets Balancer apart.\n\n**Social Media & Design**\n\nBeethoven X contributors have started developing a framework for the evolution of the Balancer social media presence. The goal is to create a strong visual identity that not only showcases the technical capabilities of Balancer but also embodies a compelling personality that leverages current trends and social narratives, similar to what we strive for with the Beethoven X brand.\n\n**Content Creation**\n\nBeethoven X contributors have started producing in depth twitter threads on relevant topics in the Balancer ecosystem:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1643985415135952896 \n](https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1643985415135952896)https://twitter.com/Balancer/status/1633490690788462592\n\nand kickstarted a technical article series:\n\n[https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/inside-balancer-contracts-a-composable-symphony-1-229f6e90224](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/inside-balancer-contracts-a-composable-symphony-1-229f6e90224d)\n\n**Key Objectives & Success Metrics:** \n\n* **Make it easier to build on Balancer** - Having become domain experts on Balancer tech, Beethoven X collaborators are uniquely positioned to identify and help build solutions for many of the pain points that exist in the current Balancer tech stack.\n* **Reduce duplicate effort across the ecosystem** - A joint API deployment is the first of several projects we see where Beethoven X contributors can leverage their domain expertise to reduce duplicate effort. How do we as an ecosystem invest significantly more energy into the future success of Balancer protocol and spend less time on the problems of today?\n* **Help drive the direction of the Balancer protocol** - We believe Balancer protocol should be a platform that empowers current and future AMM innovation. We will continue to work to align the various parties in the balancer ecosystem around this vision. How do we put a true focus on this goal? How do we empower developers to build the next generation of AMMs on Balancer protocol?\n\nOur strategy for Balancer marketing would be to highlight the major benefits of Balancer protocol across its user demographics in an engaging, informative manner. The focus of this strategy would be to educate users on product innovation, current trends and partnership developments. Coupled with engaging design / visuals the strategy stands to bring Balancer back into the limelight on social media and hopefully ignite a flywheel for growth based on relevancy, product and community.\n\nBalancer has never been more successful than it is today and we would strive to complement its immense success.\n\nIn this regard there are 2 key focuses:\n\n- **Brand Development** - Encapture the core brand values and inspire. Although a reputable figure, there is room to create an inspirational brand aesthetic that speaks well to current trends in a timeless, tasteful fashion.\n- **Social Presence** - Building from a foundation of insightful content and leveraging an unique aesthetic, social presence represents Balancer’s voice. As a thought leader in the industry the goal for the  Balancer voice is to showcase competency and relevancy through  social media outlets in a playful, engaging manner.\n\n**Length of Engagement & Budget:**\nBeethoven X is requesting 3 months of funding starting May 1, 2023 and ending July 31, 2023. \n\nWe request to continue the budget of $25,000 USDC (or BAL equivalent) per month for technical development and advisory. Additionally, we strongly believe that Beethoven X contributors can provide significant value in the areas of marketing, content creation and design. For this effort, we propose an additional budget of $15,000 USDC (or BAL equivalent) per month.\n\nAs these funds will be used to cover a portion of contributor salaries, we request that this amount be made available in a liquid form. If approved, $40,000 USDC or BAL equivalent would be sent to the below ETH address around the first of each month.\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** 0x811912c19eEF91b9Dc3cA52fc426590cFB84FC86",

It is an integral element of the Balancer Foundation corporate structure supporting the Balancer DAO. It serves two primary functions (1) Administrative and Operational; and (2) Product Development.\n\nSince the passing of BIP-55 and its subsequent extension (BIP-351, BIP-565), the Balancer OpCo product development team has been a core team in the DAO since July 2022. This proposal aims to extend the product development services for an additional 6 months (October 1, 2024 - March 31, 2025). As in the previous proposal, the administrative and operational elements provided by Balancer OpCo are submitted as a separate proposal.\n\nOur primary roles include Frontend Team Lead (Gareth), Frontend Core Engineers (Anastas and Alberto), and Product Designer (Pon).\n\nBalancer OpCo is requesting $333,325 and 1,875 BAL for 6 months of funding.\n\nRetrospective\nBalancer OpCo product team was previously funded (BIP-565) for 6 months from April 1st, 2024 through September 30th, 2024.\n\nOur high-level goals stated in the previous proposal are as follows:\n\nIncrease LP engagement and satisfaction.\nIncrease veBAL adoption and holder engagement.\nIncrease awareness and adoption of the Balancer protocol.\nThese goals have not changed and will continue to guide our focus as we build out v3 of the Balancer canonical app.\n\nOur primary focus in the previous funding cycle was to build and launch the v3 app which we called Project Zen (or the Zen UI). The Zen UI was launched on the 18th of July (4 months into our funding cycle) and was generally considered a great success for the ecosystem.\n\nIn the build-out of the Zen UI we engaged the community through the Zentestooor initiative in Discord. A big shout-out is due to Tritium for the work he did to help us get this initiative off the ground and operational. Zentestooors found many bugs and suggested great improvements that were implemented before the launch. It undoubtedly contributed to the successful launch of the new app.\n\nThree weeks after launching the new UI we also launched support for CoW AMM, another resounding success for the ecosystem. The quick turnaround from launching the UI to adding support for an entirely different underlying AMM is a testament to the architectural decisions we have made building the new app. It puts us in a great position to support v3 and any other AMM variant opportunities that develop within the ecosystem.\n\nObjectives\nObjective 1: Support the launch of the Balancer v3 protocol\nTeam: Alberto, Pon, Gareth\n\nSummary:\nThe next big launch date for the Balancer ecosystem will be the v3 protocol launch. For this, the UI will need to seamlessly support v3 pools and promote them in an effective way. That is, the UI will need to support adding liquidity to v3 pools, which requires Permit2 approvals integration. It will also require work to ensure removing liquidity, staking and unstaking work seamlessly with v3 pools. Finally, we will ensure that v3 pools are findable, distinguishable from v2 pools and promoted effectively to support the ecosystem with the growth of the v3 protocol.\n\nKey results:\n\nThe UI accurately displays pool information for v3 pools.\nThe UI supports Permit2 approvals for adding liquidity to v3 pools.\nThe UI supports adding, removing, staking and unstaking of v3 liquidity.\nThe UI makes it easy to find and distinguish v3 pools.\nTimeline:\nThe launch of the v3 protocol is currently unknown so it is impossible for us to accurately say when the key results will be achieved. However, we have already started work on Permit2 support and our goal is to be ready to go live as soon as the protocol is ready.\n\nObjective 2: New veBAL experience\nTeam: Pon, Gareth, Anastas & Alberto\n\nSummary:\nveBAL features were deliberately left out of the launch of the new UI (we currently link back to the v2 UI if a user needs to manage their veBAL or vote on gauges etc). This is because veBAL is a huge feature, almost an app in itself. We also recognised that there is a lot we can do better with the veBAL experience to better promote ownership and engagement. So instead of delaying the launch of the new app, it made sense to leave implementation for post-launch.\n\nThe new veBAL experience is currently being designed and the majority of implementation will happen in this next funding cycle. The objective for this new experience is to more effectively promote and support the benefits of owning veBAL, including the acknowledgement and integration of incentive markets such as HiddenHand.\n\nEssentially, we want to take learnings from the existing veBAL experience in v2 and community tools for leveraging incentive markets and build a new and improved experience that maximises veBAL utility for holders.\n\nKey results:\n\nA veBAL management UI where users can lock, extend and unlock/withdraw their veBAL.\nA veBAL syncing UI where users can sync their veBAL balances to secondary networks.\nA veBAL voting UI where users can see all the available gauges that can be voted on, their current votes, their estimated weekly incentives for their votes, and a vote optimizer. The vote optimizer should use incentive market data to find the maximum return for a user’s voting power.\nTimeline:\nAs with all large scopes of work, it’s difficult to estimate precise delivery timelines. The design work for each key result is already underway. Some initial development work has been started for (1) and (2). At the time of writing, we estimate that a complete veBAL experience might be live by the end of the year or early next year.\n\nObjective 3: Deprecate v2 UI & supporting infrastructure\nTeam: Gareth\n\nSummary:\nNow that the new UI is live and supporting core pool actions, swapping and reward claiming, we must continue to migrate and shut down the remaining logic in the v2 UI. Deprecating the remainder of the v2 app will allow us to shut down the v2 API, which will reduce the ecosystem’s infrastructure costs.\n\nKey results:\n\nShut down the veBAL experience in v2 UI, possible when Objective 2 is complete.\nShut down claiming, portfolio and swap pages in the v2 UI.\nTurn off the v2 API.\nTimeline:\nThe target is to shut down the v2 API (and therefore the UI) by the end of the year.\n\nObjective 4: Frontend monorepo\nTeam: Gareth, Alberto & Anastas\n\nSummary:\nThe frontend team would like to start to restructure our work such that we can share and build tooling more easily with the wider community, within Balancer and DeFi more generally. In practice, this means converting our core repository to a monorepo and extracting useful logic into packages.\n\nKey results:\n\nA functional monorepo that contains the v3 frontend app.\nA package that exposes some useful functionality currently contained within the v3 app.\nTimeline:\nThis is a secondary objective so we will not set hard deadlines. Rather, we aim to do this at some point within the next funding cycle.\n\nOngoing commitments\nThe Product Development team ensures Balancer has a high-quality UI/UX available everywhere that allows users to interact easily with the Balancer protocol. In addition, the UI serves as a branding tool where people can better understand what the Balancer Protocol allows. The team will:\n\nBuild, Improve and Optimize the canonical UI for interacting with Balancer\nWe aim to provide the best possible experience for users to provide liquidity, swap, lock veBAL, vote on gauges, and claim earnings using Balancer.\nWe will design, build and maintain the marketing pages for the Balancer protocol. The primary aim of these pages will be to inspire and help onboard potential partners into the ecosystem.\nWe ensure this UI works across all modern devices including desktop and mobile browsers.\nWe will continually optimize and improve this app so users have a great experience no matter how many features or how much data Balancer introduces in the future.\nWe will continually work on the stability and reliability of the UI by covering its critical functionality with unit and integration tests.\nWhenever new features or improvements are made to the Balancer smart contracts we will implement the primary UI for users to interact with them on launch.\nThis also includes responsibility for all copywriting across the app.\nEcosystem design support\nWe will support broader ecosystem design initiatives. For example, we’ll collaborate with marketing on creative direction and occasional asset production.\nSupport the development and maintenance of the shared Beets/Balancer API\nThe Product Development team currently maintains the Balancer API at https://api.balancer.fi, which provides quick access to Balancer pool and token information.\nThe existing API mentioned above will be deprecated in favour of the shared Beets/Balancer API at https://api-v3.balancer.fi.\nUser support\nWe will monitor relevant channels in Discord, Slack and Github issues for any reported problems and aim to respond within 24 hours and fix the problem as soon as possible.\nOpCo operations\nManage DNS for all Balancer DAO domains.\nManage 3rd party accounts, upgrades, renegotiations, etc. For example, RPC providers, AWS, and wallet check providers.\nGithub repositories that we are directly responsible for:\n\nGitHub - balancer/frontend-v3: Official UI application for the Balancer protocol.\nGitHub - balancer/frontend-v2: Frontend app for the Balancer protocol (to be deprecated)\nGitHub - balancer/balancer-api: Deprecated (v2 API, to be deprecated)\nGitHub - balancer/tokenlists 1\nGitHub - balancer/metadata\nGithub repositories we are not directly responsible for but occasionally contribute to:\n\nGitHub - balancer/b-sdk\nGitHub - balancer/docs: Documentation for Balancer\nGitHub - balancer/backend\nIn summary, Balancer OpCo’s product team is committed to building a market-leading DApp for the Balancer protocol and supporting growth opportunities through UI development as they arise. The product team are passionate about Balancer and committed to its long-term success.\n\nReporting\nThe Product Development team is committed to transparency and openness in all our work. The majority of our day-to-day activities can be followed via the previously mentioned repositories. We are also committed to providing higher-level reporting on our work in the relevant calls and on the forum. Our reporting commitments will be as follows:\n\nWeekly v3 roadmap call\nAudience: Internal, engineering and ecosystem leadership.\nHere we share status updates on our latest work and take note of any urgent requirements or future work for our team.\nMonthly forum update\nAudience: Public\nA high-level written report of work done over the past 30 days, including how that work relates to our stated goals. We will also include reflections on challenges that may be standing in the way of progress on those goals.\nRelevant metrics that the Product Development team’s work has a direct impact on.\nQuarterly community call update (if applicable)\nAudience: Public\nA higher-level update on the work done over the last quarter and work planned for the next quarter, including KPIs and visual content if relevant. This update will also include reflections on the team and its performance and any changes to the overall direction described in this funding proposal or previous quarterly reports.\nLength of Engagement & Budget\nBalancer OpCo is requesting $333,325 for 6 months of funding, starting October 1, 2024 and ending March 31, 2025.\n\nThe table below shows the applicable expense categories by quarter.\n\n\n1032×545 41.3 KB\nA further breakdown of the Balancer OpCo Product Team costs is shown below:\n\n\n1227×478 46.7 KB\nIn addition, the Balancer OpCo is requesting an allocation of 1,875 BAL for the 6 month period of the proposal that aligns with the grants included in staff employment packages. This ongoing BAL grant is being awarded to current team members on a 4-year vesting basis, with a 1-year cliff, starting from each employee’s initial employment date in the ecosystem.\n\nShould any of these employees leave before the completion of the 2-quarter proposal period, any unvested BAL would not go to the departing employee and would be available to the OpCo for allocation as incentives to potential replacement staff.\n\nLink to Service Provider Agreement (if going through the Balancer OpCo):\n\nNot applicable given this entity is internal. The Product team will be directly accountable to the Balancer OpCo and the Balancer DAO community through the reporting process applicable to all Balancer SPs, primarily with reference to the objectives and KPIs noted above.\n\nTechnical Specification\nThe Balancer DAO multisig 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f will interact with USDC 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 by writing transfer passing the Foundation/OpCo wallet 0x3B8910F378034FD6E103Df958863e5c684072693 as recipient and amount 333,325 USDC as 333325000000.\n\nNo BAL transfers are required at this time.",
