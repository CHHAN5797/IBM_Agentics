The protocol's TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.\nThe Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.\nThis has allowed the Aave DAO not only to \"cover its own bills\" but also has built [a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury).\n\n \n![treasury.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihrskqratcejxrmldlzopv4lj42esks3cgel2kugnd3ijzlt4leui)\n    \n\nAdditionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol's net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH & ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main & new markets.\n\nWith the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol's maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.\n\nThis journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.\n\nTo ensure the DAO's long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.\n\n## Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift\n\nThe Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.\n\nFortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of \"cash\" DAO treasury funds.\n\nHowever, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.\n\nWith both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:\n\n1. The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.\n2. The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.\n\nWhile it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.\n\nTherefore, Umbrella proposes:\n\n1. Segregation of coverage\n2. Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity\n\nFrom now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.\n\nUmbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role & benefits of the AAVE assets & tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey\n\nAs an initial and immediate step:\n\nWe propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.\n\nWith this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.\n\nGHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets' debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.\n\nHowever, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.\n\nSafety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO <> GHO exchange rate, but it's a risk they willingly accepted by staking.\n\nExample: If there's 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).\n\nThis paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.\n\nThis will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.\n\nThese changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.\n\nWe propose adopting the following:\n\n### Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:\n\n1. The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.\n2. The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.\n3. The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.\n4. Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol \"local\" net excess revenue.\n\n\n### StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey\n\nGHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.\n\nCurrently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.\n\nWe propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.\n\nThe Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.\n\nThis will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a \"base yield\" paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an \"Airdrop\" yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining \"boosts\" of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable \"base yield\" for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.\n\nIn practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.\n\nThis will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.\n\n## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.\n\nAAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it's simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.\n\n### End the \"Seize and Sell\" Doctrine\n\nThe \"seize and sell\" doctrine is dangerous as it's inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.\n\nAdditionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.\n\nLastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.\n\nWe propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.\n\n### StkBPT Redefinition\n\nThe Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE's secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.\n\nWhile the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.\n\nThe DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.\n\nWe propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a \"Buy & Distribute\" program funded by the protocol's excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.\n\nThe ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.\n\nThis will increase the Safety Module's budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.\n\nIn this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.\n\n### Introduction of Anti-GHO\n\nCreating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.\n\nWe propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.\n\nThe users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user's will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.\n\nAnti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:\n\n1. Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt \"for free.\"\n \n![burn anti gho mint.png](ipfs://bafkreifvldjg2ivjc3x7li4hmv4v4bde5xii6p6vwnlm6cdh62zgtlwv5m)\n    \n\n2. Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.\n\n \n![holders stkaave.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibylsxdbvqvwllrvmkd3x6b7e6dqcvuo6tnbevzz5g7jppb2hjp7a)\n    \n\n\nBoth special-purpose facilitators' \"debt\" will be regularly \"cleared\" by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.\n\nThis new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.\n\n### Closing the LEND chapter\n\nNearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.\nAfter a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.\n\nWe consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.\n\n## Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics\n\nThe Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.\n\nAdditionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.\n\nThe paradigm shift to \"seize and burn\" instead of the current \"seize and sell\" increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.\n\nThis is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.\n\nMost of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.\n\nTherefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.\n\nThis allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.\nBecause debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.\n\nTo cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.\n\naTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.\n\nUmbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.\n\nDetails and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk & Finance teams.\n\nWe’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.\n\n### Activate a \"Buy & Distribute\" Program\n\nWith the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.\n\nIn terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a \"Buy & Distribute\" program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.\n\nThere's little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it's a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.\n\nIt is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.\n\nRewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.\n\nWe propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the \"Buy & Distribute\" program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program \n\nFor an easier understanding of the new AAVEnomics vision, please consider the following visual representation:\n\n \n![visual representation.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigfqm7tms5yc2homzrgar6ikt6bbplco4cejmqg5i7jqngalmm2eq)\n    \n\n## “Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave\n\nAave's Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module. With the Umbrella upgrade, we expect the efficient coverage to increase significantly compared to the current situation, from a theoretical $100m to likely billions of mid-terms.\n\nThe Aave DAO can mobilize and monetize this coverage beyond the Aave protocol. The Aave DAO service providers are risk experts who can give valuable coverage recommendations to the Aave governance.\n\nThe Umbrella multi-token incentives controller allows for rewards in several tokens, and we believe this cost-efficient coverage of already existing significant liquidity will be of high interest for third-party protocols and networks, as shown by the high interest of the “Restaking” DeFi vertical.\n\nWhile the journey to maturity on this vertical is still long, the ACI wanted to share this mid-term vision to the community of a potential new journey for protocol revenue and Umbrella Stakers Yield.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Milestones and Trigger Conditions\n\nWhile the Aave protocol's net excess revenues are at an all-time high, it would be reckless to implement significant new budget spending without considering the protocol's long-term sustainability.\nFrom a user experience perspective, a too-ambitious distribution schedule being forced to halt due to more adverse revenue collection conditions will lead to massive and unwanted frustration.\nThe Aave DAO has always been a conservative actor and has always prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term yield.\n\nWe suggest considering the following elements as key data points to execute changes in Safety Modules in steps:\n\n- Aave Collector net holdings\n- Service providers' recurring budget\n- Merit and ALC program recurring budgets\n- GHO supply\n- GHO 30-day average revenue\n- Protocol 30-day average revenue\n\nThe ACI Proposes this vision to be implemented in 3 differents ARFCs to be sequentially proposed alongside reaching set milestones, we welcome governance feedback on this implementation Journey.\n\n## Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO\n\nAdoption of the Following Doctrine:\n\n1.

        "author": "0xEd039871ec71FBDC3D714517cE97030Dd2E88622",
        "body": "Author: Peter from the Origin Protocol core team\nDate: 2024-09-18\n\n### 1. Simple Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding supply/borrow support for wOETH on:\n\n- Aave v3 Main Ethereum Instance\n\nIf the onboarding of OETH to Aave is successful, Origin hopes to discuss an additional onboarding of wOETH to:\n\n- Aave v3 Lido Instance\n- Aave v3 EtherFi Instance\n\n### 2. Motivation/Background\n\n[Origin Ether](https://oeth.com/)(OETH) was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 that generates yield while sitting in your wallet. Similar to stETH, OETH yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\n\nUntil a [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth/proposal/0x76f64251d37310c5d241ec84a892751c7a34874faff7af848db193141ea24a6f) earlier this year, OETH was an LST aggregator that earned yield by tapping into blue-chip protocols while being collateralized by other LSTs. Over the weeks following, the ability to deploy OETH collateral to other projects was removed and LST collateral was divested back to ETH, as OETH transitioned into a full-fledged LST with an extremely tight peg (1:1 redemptions to ETH thru Origin's [ARM](https://www.originprotocol.com/arm-announcement)) and high yields thanks to DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p.\n\nWe've noticed many LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This will not be the case with OETH.\n\nUsing OETH on Aave will produce higher yield than other top LSTs and have a near perfect ETH peg. OETH ARM mechanics and gas optimizations will ensure the best possible prices for traders looking for instant exit liquidity, while DVT staking will achieve greater risk-adjusted yield. Our vision for OETH is for it to become the most trusted LST for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking.\n\nObtaining OETH is seamless, users can convert their ETH into OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on [OETH.com](https://app.oeth.com/)\n- Swapping on Curve OETH/ETH: [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-298/deposit)\n- Swapping on Uniswap OETH/ETH: [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x52299416C469843F4e0d54688099966a6c7d720f)\n- Swapping on Curve OETH/frxETH: [Curve.fi](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-353/deposit)\n\nwOETH is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the [contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192) (function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.\n\nCurrent exchange rate as of 9/18/24: 1 wOETH = 1.104402 OETH\n\n#### Security Considerations\n\nThere is no set emission schedule for OETH. Similar to stETH, OETH is minted on demand when users lock their ETH into the protocol, and burned on demand when users exit OETH for the collateral. The OETH protocol is upgradeable by a 5 of 8 multi-sig and there is a 48-hour timelock before any changes go into effect. You can read more about that in the [admin section](https://docs.originprotocol.com/ogn/governance#guardians) of the OETH docs.\n\nOETH and wOETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. All OETH audits can be found in the [audits section](https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits) of the OETH docs. We have recently retained [yAudit](https://yaudit.dev/) to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes. Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program is currently administered by [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/origindefi/), where Origin maintains a median resolution time of 6 hours.\n\nOETH/wOETH price feeds are available by ChainLink across Mainnet, Arbitrum and Base. OETH price feeds are also available via alternative oracle providers Tellor and Dia Data. OETH likely qualifies for a Correlated-Asset Price Oracle (CAPO) based on [similar LSTs](https://governance.aave.com/t/update-on-correlated-price-asset-onboarding/17012) that have qualified.\n\n#### Performance\n\nThe [current](https://www.originprotocol.com/analytics/oeth) OETH TVL sits comfortably at $71m with a native yield of 4.43% APY:\n\n![OETH TVL](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/business20/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/83e3d47e8afac53131a7307367270c22178e6fa3.png)\n\nOETH features the highest native APY on [Defillama](https://defillama.com/lsd) for LST projects with over $6m in TVL. [Proof of Yield](https://www.originprotocol.com/analytics/oeth/proof-of-yield) tracks the distribution of each OETH rebase event and displays the compounded yield on an annualized basis each day:\n\n![OETH Yield](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfj6oiCgANQgEPMwHOg6M4incao6J-SZrcPgamdiodHLgRNlf5-H4cFM0JMgfSQLvEfUdsBF9piOGBUrw-LOhI0Q6gjVwpyb2FaLQaerkjeKnncj75ge3Vu0qxLang8goEmf4xMCGT4fhdddObGcY0Rcf9E?key=OkwF9J2919MS15O4njFUig)\n\nOrigin has managed to integrate and onboard OETH and wOETH to a range of verticals across Defi, including vaults, restaking, and money markets:\n\n- Eigenlayer - [Eigenlayer](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/token/oETH)\n- Karak - [Karak](https://app.karak.network/pool/ethereum/WOETH)\n- Pendle - [Pendle](https://app.pendle.finance/trade/markets/0x62187066fd9c24559ffb54b0495a304ade26d50b/swap?view=pt&chain=ethereum)\n- Morpho - [Morpho](https://app.morpho.org/market?network=mainnet&id=0xea023e57814fb9a814a5a9ee9f3e7ece5b771dd8cc703e50b911e9cde064a12d)\n- Silo - [Silo](https://app.silo.finance/silo/0x9f4D6f98F29c1D482bCF0F85683155E0B3e015f5)\n- Shezmu - [Shezmu](https://www.shezmu.io/oasis/collateral)\n- Fraxlend - [Fraxlend](https://app.frax.finance/fraxlend/available-pairs)\n- Dolomite - [Dolomite](https://app.dolomite.io/balances)\n- Euler - [Euler](https://app.euler.finance/vault/0x01d1a1cd5955B2feFb167e8bc200A00BfAda8977)\n\n#### Benefits of listing OETH\n\n[Since 2021](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5e3646a1db86993f73e6b74a57d8640b69f7e259), Origin has streamed millions of dollars in stablecoin to Aave markets via OUSD strategies, generating millions in yield and significantly boosting Aave's TVL.\n\nEnabling lend and borrow support for wOETH on Aave will provide a new market for OETH holders and a new platform for leverage looping ETH.

        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Add support for Wrapped Super OETH (wsuperOETHb) to Aave v3",
        "author": "0xEd039871ec71FBDC3D714517cE97030Dd2E88622",
        "body": "**Author:** Peter from the Origin Protocol core team\n\n**Date:** 2024-09-20\n\n## 1. Simple Summary\n\nThis is a proposal for adding supply/borrow support for wsuperOETHb on the Aave v3 Base Instance\n\n## 2. Motivation/Background\n\nSuper OETH (superOETHb) is the next iteration of OETH, a superior LST with an extremely tight peg and high yields thanks to a combination of the OETH AMO and DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p. superOETHb yields are able to reach double digit levels, making it an exceptionally perfect token for lending and borrowing against ETH. superOETHb was built reusing 90% of the code from OETH, for which the codebase has already been audited 12+ times, and for which there is also an Aave Temp Check currently on the forum.\n\nSuper OETH is the first token in a new category of liquid staking: Supercharged LSTs. Supercharged LSTs will have materially higher yield while being designed for L2s, with a similar risk profile to mainnet LSTs. Ethereum liquid staking is amplified with chain-specific, auto-compounded incentives. Deep concentrated liquidity pools guarantee exits with minimal costs - users will never lose ability to convert back to ETH.\n\nWe've noticed many LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for projects who plan to integrate the LSTs, or for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This is not the case with OETH, and it will not be the case with Super OETH.\n\nUsing Super OETH on Aave will produce higher yield than the other top LSTs and have a near perfect ETH peg. Utilizing a concentrated Aerodrome liquidity pool with the tightest tick possible helps make Super OETH the most pegged L2 LST currently available, while being able to reach double digit yields. Our vision for Super OETH is for it to become the most trusted LST for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking.\n\nObtaining superOETHb is effortless, users can convert their ETH into Super OETH via any of the following methods:\n\n- Minting on the Super OETH dapp 1\n- Swapping on WETH/superOETHb 1 - $178.8m TVL, $1.49m volume\n- Swapping on OGN/superOETHb - $12.3m TVL, $60.5k volume\n\nwsuperOETHb is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap superOETHb, you get back a fixed number of wsuperOETHb tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wsuperOETHb tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of superOETHb tokens that you can unwrap to will go up over time, as wsuperOETHb earns yield at the same rate as standard superOETHb. The wsuperOETHb to superOETHb exchange rate can be read from the contract (0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6, function number 16), or via the OETH dapp.\n\nCurrent exchange rate as of 9/20/24: 1 wsuperOETHb = 1.00945809 superOETHb\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nsuperOETHb and wsuperOETHb were built reusing 90% of the OETH code, which was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which many audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, OUSD reached a market cap of $300m without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. All OETH audits can be found in the audits section of the OETH docs. We have recently retained yAudit to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes. Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program is currently administered by Immunefi, where Origin maintains a median resolution time of 6 hours.\n\nThrough its integration with Aerodrome, Super OETH is able to ensure a 1:1 peg with ETH at any scale. The Super OETH AMO holds a portion of the protocol's underlying collateral in a concentrated liquidity pool with an extremely tight price range within a single tick above 1.0000 WETH. This allows anyone to sell superOETHb into the pool for at least 1 WETH (minus swap fees). The Aerodrome TWAP quoter, which works the same as the Uniswap TWAP oracle, can be used to derive the price of superOETHb on chain, and a superOETHb Tellor oracle is also in the works. superOETHb is also derived from OETH, which has mainnet oracles from Chainlink, Tellor, and Dia.\n\nChainlink has actually recommended protocols treat superOETHb to be 1:1 with ETH rather than use an oracle, as Aave has done with stETH. Both Morpho and Silo have done this with their wOETH markets. Super OETH likely qualifies for a Correlated-Asset Price Oracle (CAPO) based on similar LSTs that have qualified.\n\nBy design, superOETHb is the most pegged L2 LST:\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-18 at 3.34.44 PM](https://placeholder-image.com/superOETHb-peg-chart)\n\n### Performance\n\nSuper OETH has seen incredible growth since launch. Proof of Yield tracks the distribution of each Super OETH rebase event and displays the compounded yield on an annualized basis each day. The current Super OETH TVL sits at $182m with a native yield of 18.10% APY.\n\nSuper OETH has reached the number one spot by TVL on Defillama for yield projects on Base and accounts for a large amount of the Aerodrome Slipstream TVL.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-20 at 2.19.07 PM](https://placeholder-image.com/superOETH-tvl-chart)\n\nThere has been incredible demand for borrowing ETH against Super OETH for leverage looping on money markets. Utilization has been 100% the last week, any ETH added is almost immediately borrowed:\n\n- [Morpho](https://base.morpho.org/#/markets/0x7fc174e80f264448ebee8c88a7c4476aaf58ea6)\n- [Ionic](https://base.ionicprotocol.com/pool/0x1E8D76D7D841D7ef5E1A45911BDcFae96f7f4e6c)\n\nOrigin also has managed to integrate and onboard Super OETH into smaller projects, including:\n\n- [Spectra](https://app.spectra.finance/markets)\n- [Pooltogether](https://app.pooltogether.com/deposit)\n\n### Benefits of listing Super OETH\n\nSince 2021, Origin has streamed millions of dollars in stablecoin to Aave markets via OUSD strategies, generating millions in yield and significantly boosting Aave's TVL.\n\nEnabling lend and borrow support for wsuperOETHb on Aave will provide a new market for OETH holders and Super OETH holders, and add a new platform for leverage looping ETH. This new Super OETH market would lead to additional increased TVL for Aave's Base instance, which is currently the 8th largest instance, additional revenue to the Aave Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base due to Super OETH being significantly higher yielding over the other Aave supported LSTs.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nWhile no incentives have been used within any Super OETH integrations due to the high native yield of Super OETH, the Origin Protocol team is open to providing both token incentives and seed liquidity to jumpstart the Super OETH market on Aave once wsuperOETHb is onboarded. More accurate amounts will be discussed with the Aave team and the ACI and can be shared during the ARFC stage of the proposal process.\n\n## 3.

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy a Gnosis DAO Credit Line Aave v3 Instance\n\n**Author:** @ACI and Karpatkey\n\n**Date:** 2024-09-20\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a specific Aave v3 instance to extend a GHO credit line to Gnosis DAO using GNO and wstETH collateral.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGnosis DAO, a long term partner of Aave DAO, has expressed a need for flexible access to stablecoins. This proposal aims to address this need by leveraging Gnosis DAO's treasury holdings as collateral for a GHO credit line funded by Aave DAO. By establishing this credit facility, we can enhance Gnosis DAO's liquidity management capabilities while fostering closer collaboration between Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO.\n\nThe proposed credit line will provide Gnosis DAO with a reliable source of stablecoin liquidity, enabling them to manage their treasury more efficiently and respond quickly to market opportunities or operational needs. This arrangement also presents an opportunity for Aave to expand its services to other DAOs, potentially opening up a new market segment. The credit line will also serve as a proof-of-concept for further customized extension of credit to reputable DAOs and organizations in the industry.\n\nThe GnosisDAO GHO credit line is described by the following conditions:\n\n- **Exclusive Borrower:** Gnosis DAO will be the only borrower in this specialised GHO market.\n- **Collateral Requirements:** GNO and wstETH tokens will be the primary collateral. Other potential collaterals can be considered but must be approved at a later stage.\n- **Risk Parameters:**\n  - Borrowing Rate (BR): DSR rate\n  - Other risk parameters will be discussed and decided upon by relevant service providers in collaboration with GnosisDAO during the ARFC phase of this proposal.\n- **Liquidation Process:** Managed by a designated Aave entity to ensure controlled handling of collateral.\n- **Progressive Cap Increase:** An initial Cap of 5M GHO will be configured\n  - Once the initial cap is utilized and the system operates smoothly for a predefined period (e.g., 1 month), the cap will increase progressively.\n  - The increase will be contingent upon maintaining a healthy average Health Factor (e.g., above 1.5).\n  - Further increases will be evaluated based on ongoing performance metrics and governance approvals.\n\n### Benefits for Aave\n\n- A dedicated GHO borrowing market will increase the demand for GHO and its supply.\n- Generates consistent income from the interest paid on GHO borrowing by Gnosis DAO.\n- GNO is first-class crypto asset that is currently securing the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n- Gnosis DAO will be able to further provide liquidity enhancing GHO's value proposition as DeFi stablecoin in mainnet, and specially once GHO is deployed in GC.\n- GnosisDAO is a reputable DAO with one of the largest treasuries and footprint in DeFi.\n\n### Benefits for Gnosis DAO\n\n- Provides Gnosis DAO with a reliable and sustainable credit line to support its operations and growth.\n- GNO as collateral will increase the treasury's capital efficiency and help in yield generation by borrowing GHO and putting it to use.\n- Tailored risk parameters offer better borrowing conditions compared to other lending markets.\n- Permissioned liquidation within Aave representatives will ensure proper collateral management, minimizing the risk of market manipulation, price volatility and sudden large sell-offs, also protecting Aave from excessive losses.\n- With the implementation of karpatkey's infrastructure and risk management best practices, tooling and monitoring will be put in place to ensure the debt position is properly managed at all times.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Gnosis DAO credit line will implement the following:\n\n- Credit Line Amount: 5 million GHO tokens to start, with the option to size up based on risk service provider feedback and DAO governance process.\n- Collateral Assets: GNO and wstETH\n- Authorized Users: Limited to Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO\n- GHO Borrow Rate: Set to match the current sUSDS rate of 6%\n\nThis credit line will be implemented as a specialized Aave v3 instance with the following key features:\n\n- Customized access controls to ensure only Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO can interact with the instance\n- Tailored risk parameters for GNO and wstETH as collateral assets\n- Regular reporting and monitoring mechanisms to track the usage and health of the credit line. ACI will propose further methods for safe management of this credit line pending further discussions with Gnosis DAO and risk service providers.\n\nBy implementing this credit line, we aim to provide Gnosis DAO with a flexible financial tool that leverages their existing treasury assets while maintaining the security and transparency inherent in Aave.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI did not receive compensation for creating this proposal. ACI and employees are holders and stakers of GNO as well as delegates within the Gnosis ecosystem. Gnosis DAO and Aave also share some service providers including finance service provider Karpatkey.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",
