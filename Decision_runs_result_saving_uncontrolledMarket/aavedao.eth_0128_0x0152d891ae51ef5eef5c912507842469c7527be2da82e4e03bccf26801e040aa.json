        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on Sonic\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-12-18\n\n## Simple Summary:\n\nThis Temp Check seeks the community’s input on the deployment of Aave V3 on Sonic Mainnet.\n\n## Background:\n\nSonic is a new Layer 1 EVM blockchain offering 10,000 TPS and fee monetization for app builders. It is the newest blockchain from the creators of Fantom which reached a peak TVL of circa $14.5 billion in 2021. \n\n## Motivation\n\nAave has deployed on multiple promising new L1 and L2 EVM networks and is often one of the largest protocols on these networks. Given the impressive history of the team building Sonic, and the innovations it promises, it represents a strong candidate for deployment of Aave V3. In addition, the fee monetization for apps has potential to be an additional income source for Aave.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Sonic Foundation will provide the following, upon its deployment is confirmed:\n\n- 15M USD Funding from Sonic\n- 2M migration incentives with 1.8M (of 15M funding) from Sonic + 0.8M from Aave\n- Up to 50M $S tokens Supply\n- 20M of USDC Supply\n\nMore details will be shared on ARFC stage.\n\n## Specification:\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Service Providers and this section will be updated at ARFC stage if proposal moves forward, after successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The ACI is not directly affiliated with Sonic and did not receive any compensation for creating this proposal. \n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## **Author: ACI**\n\n## **Date: 2024-10-04**\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Summary:**\n\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard EIGEN, the native token of Eigenlayer, in Aave V3 Ethereum Market. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Eigenlayer Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of EIGEN.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n1.

        "title": "[ARFC] Deployment of Aave on Linea",
        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "# [ARFC] Deployment of Aave on Linea\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-11-19\n\n> Risk Parameters have been updated and ARFC has been updated 2024-11-29\n\n## **Simple Summary**\n\nThe current ARFC proposes deploying Aave V3 on Linea to expand Aave’s reach and use cases on zk-Rollups. By integrating with Linea, Aave can offer users more efficient transactions while maintaining the security of the Ethereum mainnet. This ARFC seeks governance approval to deploy an Aave V3 instance on Linea.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nLinea is a Layer 2 built on Ethereum, powered by a zkEVM tech stack developed by Consensys. Linea is the result of more than five years of cryptographic research and 20 months of dedicated R&D. The Consensys team has a strong track record in the zk space, including contributions like the GNARK library and active involvement in Ethereum's Merge. Linea is well-positioned within the developer ecosystem through relationships with MetaMask, SMG, and Infura.\n\nBy deploying on Linea, Aave can leverage high throughput and fast finality, enabling efficient transaction processing and reduced gas fees. Additionally, Linea's integration with Consensys products allows seamless distribution to users, potentially reaching MetaMask's 30 million active users. This presents an opportunity to make DeFi more accessible and expand Aave's user base.\n\nLinea’s TVL currently sits at ~$780M. Further Linea market data can be found [here.](https://defillama.com/chain/Linea)\n\n### **Benefits of deploying to Linea**\n\n1. **Scalability and Performance**: Linea enables high throughput and fast finality for zk networks, allowing Aave to scale effectively alongside Linea as its technology advances.\n2. **Accessibility and Distribution**: Linea is integrated with Consensys products like MetaMask, and Infura, facilitating seamless distribution to users and making DeFi more accessible to MetaMask's 30 million active users.\n3. **GHO Integration**: Upon successful deployment and bootstrapping of Aave on Linea, the Consensys team is motivated to enable GHO, Aave's stablecoin, to be spendable on the [MetaMask Debit Card](https://metamask.io/news/latest/introducing-metamask-card-upgrade-your-crypto-spending/), which is exclusively available on Linea.\n4. **Growth Opportunities**: With exciting growth catalysts for Linea in the upcoming H1, establishing Aave as the premier lending market on Linea will ensure long-term sustainability and growth for the Aave protocol.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\n1. Aave DAO commits to redistribute to Aave users via liquidity mining, GHO secondary liquidity incentives, safety module deployments, or merit programs any airdrop provided by the Linea ecosystem.\n2. ACI, on behalf of the Aave DAO, will coordinate any liquidity mining campaign on a Linea Aave V3 deployment.\n\n### **Risk Parameters**\n\nRisk parameters will be provided by service providers and this section will be updated in due course.\n\n| Asset | Supply on Linea | Marketcap on Linea | Volume | Liquidity | Lineascan |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WETH | 22,800 | $78,9M | $18.15M | $11.7M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0xe5d7c2a44ffddf6b295a15c148167daaaf5cf34f) |\n| weETH | 22,900 | $83,3M | $2.5M | $5.1M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0x1bf74c010e6320bab11e2e5a532b5ac15e0b8aa6) |\n| ezETH | 34,600 | $124,4M | $4.9M | $12.1M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5) |\n| wstETH | 2,500 | $10,2M | $85,000 | $4.6M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0xb5bedd42000b71fdde22d3ee8a79bd49a568fc8f) |\n| WBTC | 220 | $20,2M | $2.7M | $3.6M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0x3aab2285ddcddad8edf438c1bab47e1a9d05a9b4) |\n| USDC.e | 28,700,000 | $28,7M | $4.7M | $8.8M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0x176211869ca2b568f2a7d4ee941e073a821ee1ff) |\n| USDT | 10,400,000 | $10,4M | $7.3M | $9.9M | [URL](https://lineascan.build/token/0xa219439258ca9da29e9cc4ce5596924745e12b93) |\n\n|  | WETH | wstETH | ezETH | weETH | WBTC | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |\n| Enable Borrow | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Enable Collateral | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 75% | 72% | 72.5% | 73% | 75% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 83% | 79% | 75% | 75% | 78% | 78% | 78% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 6% | 7% | 7.5% | 7.5% | 7% | 5% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15% | 5% | 45% | 45% | 20% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Supply Cap | 1,200 | 800 | 1,200 | 1,200 | 25 | 12,000,000 | 7,800,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,100 | 400 | 600 | 600 | 12.5 | 11,000,000 | 7,150,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| UOptimal | 90% | 45% | 45% | 45% | 45% | 90% | 90% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 2.7% | 7% | 7% | 7% | 7% | 5.5% | 5.5% |\n| Slope2 | 80% | 300% | 300% | 300% | 300% | 60% | 60% |\n| Stable Borrowing | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |\n| Flashloanable | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| E-Mode Category | Ethereum Correlated | Ethereum Correlated, wstETH/WETH | Ethereum Correlated | Ethereum Correlated | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n\n**ETH-Correlated E-Mode**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | WETH | wstETH | weETH | ezETH |\n| Collateral | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes | No | No | No |\n| Max LTV | 90% | 90% | 90% | 90% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 93% | 93% | 93% | 93% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n**wstETH/WETH E-Mode**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | WETH | wstETH |\n| Collateral | No | Yes |\n| Borrowable | Yes | No |\n| Max LTV | 93.5% | 93.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 95.5% | 95.5% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 1.00% | 1.00% |\n\n### **Useful Links**\n\n- [Linea Website](http://linea.build/)\n- [Lineascan](https://lineascan.build/)\n- [Linea Docs](https://docs.linea.build/)\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1.

        "body": "[TEMP CHECK] Add FBTC to Aave v3 Main Instance on Ethereum\nAuthor: @ACI\nDate: 2024-11-01\n\nSummary\nThe proposal aims to onboard Ignition’s FBTC, to the Aave v3 protocol Main Market on Ethereum.\n\nMotivation\nFBTC is a cross-chain BTC protocol that uses the Threshold Signature Scheme network to enable secure, decentralized Bitcoin scalability across multiple blockchains. By leveraging multi-party computation, FBTC strengthens bridge security, safeguarding user assets and ensuring robust cross-chain interoperability. This setup also integrates a cross-chain hub, allowing seamless BTC transfers while reducing issues linked to Bitcoin L2 growth.\n\nThis new asset will broaden opportunities for Bitcoin holders aiming to participate in DeFi on Aave v3. The introduction of FBTC offers users more flexibility in leveraging their Bitcoin, enhancing liquidity and driving increased engagement within the Aave protocol.\n\nWith $480M in total value locked (TVL), FBTC is emerging as a compelling solution in Bitcoin bridging, supported by its upcoming Chainlink Oracle integration to accelerate growth across EVM networks. Aave stands to gain significantly as a primary partner in this expansion, following the successful playbook of cbBTC, which quickly scaled through similar collaborative efforts.\n\nSpecification\nTicker: FBTC\n\nContract address on mainnet: 0xC96dE26018A54D51c097160568752c4E3BD6C364\n\nChainlink oracle: upcoming\n\nProject: https://fbtc.com/\n\nReserves addresses: Bitcoin Reserve Address | FBTC\n\nProof of Assets dashboard: FBTC proof of assets dashboard\n\nGitHub: GitHub - fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract\n\nDocs: https://docs.fbtc.com/\n\nAudit: fbtc-contract/audits at main · fbtc-xyz/fbtc-contract · GitHub\n\nTwitter: x.com\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Services Providers at the earliest possible and ARFC will be updated with that feedback.\n\nDisclosure\nThe ACI is not directly affiliated with Ignition and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\nPublish a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "---\n### [TEMP CHECK] Onboard osGNO to Aave v3 Gnosis\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-29\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to Onboard osGNO, the Liquid Staking Token (LST) of StakeWise V3 into the GnosisMarket. By integrating osGNO, Aave users will be provided with additional liquidity and yield opportunities while supporting the growth of LSTs within the DeFi ecosystem on Gnosis Chain.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nGNO is used for governance within the GnosisDAO and acts as a staking token for Gnosis Chain. \n\nosGNO is a Liquid Staking Token (LST) representing GNO staked in StakeWise V3 on Gnosis Chain. It can be minted from any Vault created in StakeWise on Gnosis in order to make a user’s stake liquid. Users have the option of staking in one of the Vaults in the Marketplace to mint osGNO, creating their own Vault as a solo staker and minting osGNO from there, or purchasing osGNO directly on a DEX.\n\nCreating Vaults and staking in them is a permissionless process on StakeWise, and so is access to osGNO. For additional protection, every minted osGNO has an excess backing of staked tokens, provided by the minters themselves.  \n\nosGNO increases in value relative to GNO as staking rewards accrue, it can be redeemed for the underlying GNO within Vaults using the redemption mechanism detailed [here](https://docs.stakewise.io/protocol-overview-in-depth/oseth#redemption-mechanism). If there are not sufficient liquid reserves available for redemption, there may be delays in unstaking and redeeming the osGNO for underlying GNO which could result in a temporary depeg.\n\nosETH was recently added as collateral on Aave v3 Ethereum and has seen good adoption. In order to improve Aave’s marketshare on Gnosis Cchain, and support the Gnosis and StakeWise ecosystems it is proposed to also Onboard osGNO into Gnosis Market.\n\n### **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nPotential POL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\n### **Specification**\n\nContract address: 0xF490c80aAE5f2616d3e3BDa2483E30C4CB21d1A0\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC Stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nosGNO announcement post: https://stakewise.medium.com/announcing-the-launch-of-stakewise-v3-on-gnosis-chain-0231285bd8e3\n\nosGNO Vaults: https://app.stakewise.io/vaults\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with StakeWise and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and some ACI team members are holders of GNO.\n\n### **Next Steps**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
