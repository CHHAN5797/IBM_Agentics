The BAL liquidity pools offer poor capital efficiency, with the utilization of the Reserve ([48.27%](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x9a71012b13ca4d3d0cdc72a177df3ef03b0e76a3&marketName=proto_polygon_v3) on Polygon v3) often near the Optimal point of 45%.\n\nBy changing the interest rate curve across all three active Liquidity Pools, this proposal is expected to improve capital efficiency by lowering interest rates on markets where borrowing is disabled and enticing capital to move to where borrowing demand generates an attractive yield. This is expected to generate more revenue for the DAO and generate significant capital efficiency within the BAL Reserves.\n\nDue to the ongoing incentives offered by Aura Finance, any new deposits are expected to be borrowed. Users are able to borrow and deposit BAL into [Aura Finance’s staking contract](https://app.aura.finance/) to earn a yield of around 45% at the time of writing. This creates an arbitrage opportunity of 16.82% taking into account the liquidation risk, auraBAL peg and additional Smart Contract risk.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUsers are expected to continue borrowing BAL to earn yield whilst interest rates permit and, in doing so, will create ongoing borrowing demand for BAL. Changing the interest rate curve by amending the Uoptimal parameter from 45% to 80% will improve the capital efficiency of Reserves. However, with borrowing disabled on some Aave deployments, lending rates will drop and it is rational for profit driven actors to transition liquidity to the Reserve that offers the greatest yield.\n\nThe three charts below show the most recent 5 month historical BAL interest rate across each BAL Reserve. The interest rate at the current Optimal point is 7%, which is low relative to current demand of 28.18% on Polygon v3. This proposal recommends increasing the interest rate (slope 1 parameter) to 14% which is a 100% increase to the existing rate. Over time, we will be able to monitor the Reserve and amend the slope 1 parameter in an attempt to keep the utilization beneath the Optimal point for the majority of the time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pyLdQvS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6sNc6ku.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eAG1lOG.png)\n\nIn addition, this proposal introduces a base rate of 3% and changes slope 2 from 300 to 150. This means at 0% utilization, the interest rate for borrowers is 3% and the gradient post-Optimal point is reduced, resulting in a less volatile interest rate for users with increasing utilization. The result will be a BAL interest rate similar to the SNX interest rate curve which has a base 3%, slope 1 12% and slope 2 100%.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b3kks7y.png)\n\nUtilization of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 73.33% assuming users can borrow BAL and are willing to pay an interest rate of 13%, which is less than the current borrowing rate of 28.18%. With a borrowing cost of 14% at the Optimal point, depositing BAL into Aura Finance’s auraBAL staking contract or B-80BAL-20wETH / auraBAL gauge will remain lucrative for users. If the utilization exceeds the Uoptimal point, a follow up proposal will propose increasing the interest rate further.\n\nThe improved capital efficiency of the BAL Reserve is expected to lead to an increase in BAL liquidity on-chain. The more on-chain liquidity there is, the more expensive it is to manipulate an oracle feed. Based upon the @ChaosLabs Borrow Cap formula, Llama proposes increasing the Borrow Cap on the Polygon v3 from  96,798.00 units to 256,140.00 units.\n\nWith respect to the Polygon v3 deployment, assuming the BAL Reserve remains at $979,230, the revenue generated at the Optimal point for the DAO will increase from $6.17k to $20.4k, or 230%. The Reserve utilization increases from 45% to 80%, which reduces the amount of unused BAL by 63.6%. This will provide a significant increase in capital efficiency.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the BAL Interest Rate on Ethereum v2, Polygon v2 and Polygon v3.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|45|80|\n|Base|0|3|\n|Slope1|7|14|\n|Slope2|300|150|\n|Reserve Factor|20|20|\n\nThe below shows the proposed changes to the Borrow Cap on Polygon v3.\n\n|Polygon Parameter| Units |\n| --- | --- | \n| Supply Cap | 284,600 (no change)|\n| Borrow Cap | 256,140 |\n\nBorrow Cap is calculated: \n(Uoptimal + 0.1) x SupplyCap\n(0.8+0.1) x 284,600 = 256,140\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0\\(https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave v3 Polygon wMATIC Interest Rate Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz, @MatthewGraham\nDated: 2022-12-17\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nLlama presents a proposal to amend the wMATIC interest rate parameters on the Aave Polygon v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe current utilization of the wMATIC Reserve is 42.5% with borrowing costs of 6.61%, [1]. As the borrowing cost exceeds the yield obtained from staked MATIC receipt tokens, there is insufficient economic incentive for users to utilize the MATIC eMode.\n\nThis proposal is intended to increase the capital efficiency of the wMATIC Reserve by increasing the utilisation of the pool and reducing borrowing costs. This is achieved by amending the Uoptimal parameter and selecting the interest rate at the inflection point on the yield curve to be the lower of the two most prominent staked MATIC receipt tokens.\n\nUtilisation of the liquidity in the Reserve is expected to increase from 45% → 72.5%. At the proposed interest rate inflection point, the recursive stMATIC/wMATIC loop will be slightly unprofitable, with borrowing costs of 6.1% exceeding the 5.9% Proof of Stake (PoS) yield by 20 bps. Borrowing costs are reduced by 12.1% across the inflection points and the DAO’s revenue increases 35.8% at the new breakeven point to current market conditions.\n\n# Motivation\n\nWith wMATIC borrowing costs exceeding the yield of MaticX and stMATIC, users are unlikely to enter into the Matic eMode without financial incentive. Upon review of the wMATIC reserve, the Uoptimal parameter set at 45% means users can borrow up to 45% of the wMATIC in the Reserve before Slope2 notably increases the borrowing cost.\n\nIncreasing the Uoptimal parameter 20% from 45% to 65% would enable users to borrow 20% more of the wMATIC in the Reserve for the same borrowing rate at the inflection point. When utilization exceeds the Slope1, borrowers will be paying the Slope2 interest rate which is set at 300%. Reducing the Slope2 from 300% to 100% in line with other reserves will reduce interest rate volatility.\n\nThe breakeven rate on the recursive strategy should occur before the yield inflection point such that rates are less volatile with small fluctuations in utilization. With the Slope1 parameter set at 7%, the recursive yield strategy breaks even at 58.5% utilization. This is 6.5% prior to the inflection point, which is conservative.\n\nThe capital efficiency of the Reserve can be improved by reducing the Slope1 parameter to the PoS yield source of the recursive strategy. The PoS yield is currently fluctuating between 5.6% and 5.9%, so changing the Slope1 parameter to 6.1%(-0.9%) changes the breakeven utilization from 54.8% to 62.9% (+8.1%), [2,3].\n\nBased upon the above, there is a 210bps buffer between breakeven on the recursive strategy utilization point relative to the inflection point in the interest rate curve set at 65%. It is therefore possible to increase the Uoptimal parameter and further improve the capital efficiency of the Reserve. With Slope1 set at 6.1% and Uopitmal at 75%, the new breakeven Utilisation is 72.5%(+15.3%) relative to Uoptimal set at 65%. The breakeven point is now 250bps less than the interest rate inflection point.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZloZ51jG8cSo9pK37apk9xqwSnyM2T6WwKWEaimSNA8sVpcxxsRrQBYPf9F6DAFMzXPdlhRWwNePF_5kZrTEoZu8-rfk3CmDtTivdrrwTTQGrAe-ZoZ1to1PlsAaFfbkmQLeRdOAy0qukls3wJAXFgKgCA6TUd6jP2w6mbO4WWKOguI0RjWEQ7BkIg \"Chart\")\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the wMATIC Reserve.\n\n|Parameter|Current|Proposed|\n|---|---|---|\n|Uoptimal|45%|75%|\n|Base|0%|0%|\n|Slope1|7%|6.1%|\n|Slope2|300%|100%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|20%|\n|Supply Cap|32.88M|47M|\n|Borrow Cap|9.23M|39.95M|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0x0d500b1d8e8ef31e21c99d1db9a6444d3adf1270&marketName=proto_polygon_v3\n[2] https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx\n[3] https://lido.fi/\n[4] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [4].",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARC] ETH Interest Rate Curve Update\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz @MatthewGraham @Dydymoon \nDated: 2022-11-05\n\n---\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n@Llamaxyz presents a proposal to amend ETH interest rate parameters on the Aave Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 (when deployed) Liquidity Pools.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWith Aave v3 about to be deployed on Ethereum and a wstETH and ETH eMode likely, the ETH Interest Rate should be adjusted such that the looped recursive strategy breaks even within Slope 1 where the Interest Rate changes are less volatile.\n\nThe new interest rate curve has an Interest Rate of 5.75% at the Uoptimal point, which is 25 bps more than stETH yield at the time of writing. This proposal will lead to improved capital efficiency of the ETH Reserve and generate more revenue for the DAO when compared to just replicating the v2 Interest Rate curve on v3 with the introduction of an ETH eMode Category.\n\nFor the existing v2 market, @llamaxyz suggests adopting the same Interest Rate parameters as being proposed on v3. This will enable the ETH yields across the markets to somewhat equalize leading to higher utilization of the ETH Reserve and more revenue for the DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nBy changing the Interest Rate at the Uopotimal point from 3% to 5.75%, when an eMode for ETH and wstETH is created on Aave v3 the recursive strategy will break even prior to reaching the Uoptimal utilization within the Reserve. This is a desirable feature as the volatility of the Interest Rate on Slope 1 is less than Slope 2. By setting the Slope 1 parameter at 5.75%, 25 bps greater than the current annual wstETH yield, utilization in the Reserve is not expected to reach the Uoptimal level for any prolonged period of time. By reducing the Slope 2 parameter, from 100 to 80, the gradient of the second part of the yield curve increases due to an increase in Uoptimal from 70% to 80%. This is subtle and can be seen in the chart below. The Base Rate for the existing Interest Rate and proposed Interest Rate is unchanged at 0%.\n\nWith the new Interest Rate curve recommended for the v3 deployment, it is reasonable to expect the yield across the v2 and v3 deployment to be arbitraged. If the yield on the v3 deployment converges to the wstETH rate, then this will shift the v2 Reserve utilization beyond the Uoptimal level set at 3%. Because of this, it is recommended to also change the v2 Interest Rate to match the v3 deployment Interest Rate. This way both v2 and v3 Reserves will experience utilization along the Slope 1 portion of the Interest Rate curve whilst also benefiting from improved capital efficiency.\n\nThe graphic below shows the changes in the interest rate.\n\n![|602x372](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/y8ecsyo-6itRFl1OYcFSwfkFvouFWxFad8CC-bjso4Q0D2ya_bSLCosOoh1Z2e8VhSIR8mqSH5srOrah6zPXGRPZs_vcukByDXmknVZOndIeYWe_uX-AaicOPPJB-WviEbyRY1O5ylKgwW-uQxyqyJQ6MtBt3ltJ50wzx4tBmUu3BCq5X2ABiilAsqjz4A \"Chart\")\n\nThis proposal increases the Reserve Factor from 10% to 15%, directing 15% of the interest paid to Aave DAO. When combined with the Interest Rate changes, the v2 deployment will generate an estimated $13.1k per day, up from around $5.5k per day. Prior to this proposal, due the implementation of AIP-68, the Aave DAO is earning less revenue from the ETH Reserve post merge despite utilization within the Reserve increasing significantly over that time, [2].\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the current and proposed changes to the ETH Reserve on Ethereum v2 and Ethereum v3 when deployed.\n\n|Parameter|Current (%)|Proposed (%)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Uoptimal|70|80|\n|Base|0|0|\n|Slope1|3.0|5.75|\n|Slope2|100|80|\n|Reserve Factor|10|15|\n\n# References\n\n[1] https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2&marketName=proto_mainnet\n[2] https://governance.aave.com/t/optimize-rate-curve-for-eth-improve-revenue-generation/7571\n[3] https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0, [3].",

As a result, FEI will become backed 1:1 with DAI and redeemable 1FEI:1DAI. With Tribe DAO transitioning into a terminal state, the FEI stablecoin will overtime be redeemed for DAI.\n\nAs FEI is redeemed for DAI, over time FEI’s circulating supply and liquidity will also fall away. Without sufficient liquidity, liquidations can not be performed efficiently which creates a risk for the Ethereum Aave v2 market.\n\nIn response to recent events, this ARC proposes disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor. A separate forum post will emerge that recommends all aFEI be redeemed for FEI and swapped for DAI via the contracts deployed by Tribe DAO.\n\nThis proposal is to disable lending and borrowing of FEI whilst enabling existing debt to be repaid and collateral to be withdrawn.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the emergence of news that Tribe DAO intends to dissolve FEI and the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) backing the stablecoin, there is a need to amend the FEI lending market in preparation of the risks to emerge with transition Tribe DAO to a terminal state.\n\nThe details around how Tribe DAO will transition from current state to terminal state can be found [here](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475).\n\nAs FEI will be redeemed for DAI, the stablecoin will suffer diminishing liquidity and diminishing supply. This renders the FEI stablecoin not suitable as a supported asset on Aave markets.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe recommendation is to disabling Deposits, disabling Borrowing and route 100% of the interest paid by borrowers to the Reserve Factor.\n\n**Risk Parameters:**\n\nFreeze the FEI market which will:\n\nBorrowing Enabled → Disable \nLending Enabled → Disable \n\nAlso,\n\nReserve Factor 20% → 100%\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThe next step for this ARC is after a period of discussion of at least 5 days to publish a governance snapshot vote at the **earliest 24th August 2022**, with YAE / NAY / ABSTAIN options and in the case of YAE majority publish an AIP to modify FEI risk parameters as outlined above at the earliest possible date **29th August 2022**.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: ARC - Update Risk Parameters Mainnet Arc Market\nstatus: Proposed\nauthor: @MatthewGraham, @ncitron, 3SE Holdings and UHOM\nCreated: 10/04/2022\n\n----\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThis ARC proposes updating the mainnet Arc market Loan to Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold to be the same asset listed on mainnet V2 market, as determined by Gauntlet.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe risk parameters on the mainnet Arc market are currently not being maintained and are more conservative than those belonging to the same asset on mainnet V2 market. This proposal recommends updating the mainnet Arc market LTV parameter to match the LiquidationThreshold of the same asset listed on mainnet V2 market.\n\nWe intend to re-propose a quarterly update of the risk parameters for the mainnet Arc market quarterly in an attempt to keep both markets in sync with mainnet V2 market, or mainnet V3 once live.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis risk parameter change is targeting the following improvements on the Aave Arc Market:\n\n* Align Risk Parameters - The risk parameters on Aave Arc market are currently more conservative and are in need of being updated to better reflect the mainnet V2 market and also the risk profile of the user.\n* Improve UX - Increasing LTV ratios and reducing the Liquidity Penalty enables greater capital efficiency across the market.\n\nGiven the extra precaution shown when approving Borrowers on the Aave Arc Market, the recommendation is to amend the LTV to reflect the risk profiles of market participants. For now, the intent is to maintain the mainnet Arc market in line with the mainent V2 market on a quarterly basis.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below table shows the assets listed on the mainnet Arc market and their respective risk parameters on the mainnet Arc market.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-10 at 13.51.24.png](ipfs://QmW2GXLNVMV5o61TT2hLesLpd1KuB1eoqjD6Q8K6Qixv2B)\n\nThe below table shows the assets listed on the mainnet Arc market and their respective risk parameters on the Aave V2 market. This is for comparison purposes only.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-10 at 13.53.12.png](ipfs://QmVXnEEicadDjjbKQbxVWRoHmwXGFc3U6hvvzjF3MSSwhs)\n\nThe below table shows the assets listed on the mainnet Arc market and the proposed risk parameters.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-10 at 13.53.40.png](ipfs://QmSBZym1PLqXtNCnbqVEPF4Uswph6Qcboy7y2diyTQmXpD)\n\n# Voting\n\nFOR:\n\nDO Update the risk parameters on mainnet Arc market as per mainet V2 market\n\nAGAINST:\n\nDO NOT change the existing arrangement.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

    "summary": "This proposal seeks to upgrade the CRV interest rate curve parameters across multiple Aave markets including Ethereum v2, Ethereum v3 (upcoming), Polygon v3, and Polygon v2, by increasing the SupplyCap and BorrowCap on Polygon v3, adjusting Uoptimal from 45% to 70%, introducing a Base interest rate of 3%, doubling Slope1 to 14%, and raising the Reserve Factor to 20%. The changes aim to improve capital efficiency and increase DAO revenue.",

      "Raising the Base interest rate and Slope1 aligns interest rates better with current borrowing demand, enhancing revenue.",
      "Reserve Factor increase to 20% aligns with other Aave deployments and boosts protocol revenue.",
