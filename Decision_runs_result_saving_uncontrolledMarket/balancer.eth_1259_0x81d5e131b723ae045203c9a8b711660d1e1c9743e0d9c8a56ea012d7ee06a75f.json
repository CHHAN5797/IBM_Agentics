USDM is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by the [Mountain Protocol](https://mountainprotocol.com/)\n* GYD is a USD denominated stablecoin, issued by the [Gyroscope protocol](https://gyro.finance/)\n---\n\n### Motivation\nGyroscope is further expanding on Arbitrum and bootstrapping wUSDM/GYD liquidity on Arbitrum with the first respective pool.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n#### Governance\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.

The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\n- The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1101\n\n### Summary \nThis is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge for a wstETH/WETH E-CLP on Arbitrum with Core Pool status.\n\n### References/Useful links\n* [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n* [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n* [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n* [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n---\n\n### Protocol description\n* \"wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH. [..] wstETH keeps your balance of stETH fixed and uses an underlying share system to reflect your staking rewards.\" - [Lido](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5231836-what-is-lido-s-wsteth)\n* WETH is an ERC-20 compliant wrapper of ETH.\n---\n\n### Motivation\nGyroscope is further expanding on Arbitrum. This pool is replacing a previously deployed E-CLP for the same assets and is calibrated to have a better fitting liquidity shape.\n\n---\n\n### Specifications\n#### Governance\nThe Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n\n #### Oracles\n- 'rateProvider0': wstETH rate provider on Arbitrum: [0xf7c5c26B574063e7b098ed74fAd6779e65E3F836](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xf7c5c26B574063e7b098ed74fAd6779e65E3F836)\n-  'rateProvider1': WETH rate provider on Arbitrum: 0x00\n\n#### Audits\nAudit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production on Polygon since November 2022.\n\n#### Centralization vectors\nNo centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n\n#### Market History\n- The Gyroscope Protocol is live on Ethereum since EOY23, with E-CLPs on several other chains. Details available [here ](https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope-e-clps).\n- wstETH and WETH already have markets on Balancer and other DEXes, but without the capital efficiency of an E-CLP.\n\n## Value\nAs per “Motivation”.\n\n---\n\n#### Contracts\n- E-CLP: [0x7967FA58B9501600D96bD843173b9334983EE6E6](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x7967FA58B9501600D96bD843173b9334983EE6E6)\n- Childchain gauge on Arbitrum: [0x96d7C70c80518Ee189CB6ba672FbD22E4fDD9c19](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x96d7C70c80518Ee189CB6ba672FbD22E4fDD9c19)\n- Arbitrum Chain root gauge on Ethereum: [0x3ABa56CeC68987963566a9AA93bb7f7DD28De3F5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ABa56CeC68987963566a9AA93bb7f7DD28De3F5)\n\n---\n\n> Specification\n>\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n> gauge(address): `0x3ABa56CeC68987963566a9AA93bb7f7DD28De3F5`\n> gaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",
