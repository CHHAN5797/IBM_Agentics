        "body": "---\naip: <to be assigned>\ntitle: Add FEI to Aave V2\nstatus: Proposed\nauthor: Joey Santoro (@joeysantoro), Brianna Montgomery (@bpm6867)\nshortDescription: Create a new Aave V2 market for the FEI stablecoin\ndiscussions: https://discord.gg/aDeErjS6Dt\ncreated: 2021-06-16\nupdated: N/A\n---\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFei Protocol issues a decentralized, scalable USD stablecoin called FEI. FEI aims to become a widely used decentralized stablecoin that reduces centralization risk throughout DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nFEI is backed by protocol owned reserves used to provide liquidity and stabilize the peg. The Fei community is committed to using decentralized reserve assets and oracles to have FEI be as decentralized as possible. FEI is an ideal candidate to be included on Aave to provide more decentralized stablecoin alternatives.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBeing the liquidity protocol, Aave understands the need for robust capital efficient liquidity in creating healthy markets. DAI and sUSD being the current available options for decentralized stablecoins is good but likely insufficient longer term. Having more options like FEI will improve liquidity and optionality for protocols which are committed to decentralization.\n\nFEI brings with it substantial liquidity in the form of the $500m ETH-FEI pair on Uniswap V2. This can allow ETH leverage traders a capital efficient way to benefit from Aave liquidity and FEI liquidity. The yield paid by these traders will attract more FEI liquidity to Aave, benefiting both ecosystems.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n@Brianna is a core team member at Fei Labs focused on ecosystem development.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\nFEI is a decentralized and scalable stablecoin for DeFi.\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nIf listed, FEI would be one of the most decentralized stablecoins on Aave. The Fei DAO can support FEI markets on Aave by providing FEI liquidity, approved via snapshot for 25 million. Traders will have the ability to tap into the large FEI-ETH liquidity on Uni V2 ($561 million) as well as any future protocol owned or incentivized liquidity pools.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nFei Protocol launched in April 2021 with a DAO since day one, and currently has over $643 million in liquidity. Fei aligns itself with the top communities and teams in the space, including Aave, with a similar decentralization ethos. There has been a large voter turnout during important community and team lead proposals that supported stabilizing the peg after the initial launch of the protocol.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\nFEI is currently being used in lending markets, including Fuse, and soon to be CREAM. FEI is growing and finding utilization in other financial service offerings in the broader DeFi ecosystem: lending, synthetics, option platforms, exchanges and AMM’s, etc.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nContracts within the Fei protocol have the ability to mint and burn FEI through processes that support stabilization around the 1 USD price target. The DAO controlled by TRIBE holders has the ability to mint FEI and appoint other Minter and Burner contracts.\n\nThe FEI contract itself is not upgradeable.\n\nAn additional role, the Guardian, can pause the minting of FEI. The Fei Core Team holds this role in a multi-sig, with the intention of either renouncing the role or transitioning to a community held multi-sig. More information can be read in our docs: https://docs.fei.money/governance/fei-guardian 1\n\n6. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\n\tMarket Cap: $527,000,000\n\t24h Volume: $70,000,000\n\tVolatility: Low\n\tExchanges: Uniswap V2, Uniswap V3, Gate.io 1, MXC, Virgox, BiKi, etc. As reported by CoinGeicko 3.\n\tMaturity: Early-Mid\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n27K followers on Twitter, 2 17k members in Discord 3, Github\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\tDate of Deployment: March 28, 2021\n\tNumber of Transactions: 81,798\n\tNumber of Holders: 4,089\n\n## Rationale\nBecause FEI is an earlier stage project the proposal is only for depositing and lending. The use of rateStrategyStableTwo, reserve factor, and disabled stable borrowing is appropriate for similar stablecoins per https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe FEI price oracle will be served via [ChainLink](https://chain.link/), which includes the [FEI/ETH feed](https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses).\n\nFEI will only be used for depositing and lending, not as collateral. The following params are proposed:\n\n\n  - Strategy: rateStrategyStableTwo\n  - Base LTV As Collateral: 0\n  - Liquidation Threshold: 0\n  - Liquidation Bonus: 0\n  - Borrowing Enabled: true\n  - Stable BorrowRate Enabled: false\n  - Reserve Decimals: 18\n  - Reserve Factor: 2000\n\nFollowing the steps from the [Aave governance docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/protocol-governance/governance/propose-your-token-as-new-aave-asset), the following contracts were generated:\n\n- Interest bearing aFEI: 0x08bbB5922550e6992ebDA8252A31AA02924EF28A\n- Variable Debt variableDebtFEI: 0xa4893779e193AbD23CE494e5400ca340033606C7\n- Stable Debt stableDebtFEI: 0xa4767eA500bc04430dE609A523CDc99c9537867C\n- Strategy Implementation for FEI: 0x9f7663e34a2c2Be586126Eed5AF4651b062a51A6\n\n## References\n\nWebsite - https://fei.money/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/feiprotocol\n\nDocs - https://docs.fei.money/\n\nGithub - https://github.com/fei-protocol\n\nToken Contract - https://etherscan.io/token/0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

This is partially due to several communities having built products that deposit stETH and borrow ETH as part of a rewards-maximizing strategy The demand for stETH has increased as a result of listing stETH on Aave V2, which has increased the revenue of both Aave & Lido protocols while increasing liquidity & stability of stETH.\n\nLSDs (liquid staking derivative) assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.\n\nOnboarding LSDs is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.\n\nAave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.\n\nRocket Pool is a prime candidate to add diversity to Aave, being the second most liquid LSD asset in the ecosystem.\n\nSpecification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Rocket Pool to push this proposal.\nIncreasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform.\n\nThe ACI received support from the rocket pool team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer rETH-related questions.\n\nthe ACI took inspiration from @Marceau previous ARC attempt work 5 and updated data & did edits\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nRocket Pool is a decentralized Ethereum staking protocol with permissionless Node Operators.\nRocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH\nrETH is a LSD token representing staked ETH.\nThe rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time.\nSimply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.\nWithout a stake pool service, only wealthy network participants who meet the 32ETH threshold are rewarded for validating transactions.\nRocket Pool democratizes participation in network validation by providing a service which lowers the collateral threshold.\nAbstracting staked ETH as rETH participants are able to retain commodity properties of their stake (transfer of ownership).\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nrETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Rocket Pool node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, rETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.\nrETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.\nrETH is a good long term holding collateral but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.\nrETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.\nrETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nRocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years.\nThe Rocket Pool protocol went live on 9th November 2021. It was a staged rollout with full unlimited opening on 22 November 2021.\nrETH supply has grown to 176k rETH backed by 185.6k ETH 2\nThe Rocket Pool protocol has a two DAO structure. More information on the Rocket Pool DAOs can be found here: Rocket Pool — Staking Protocol Part 2 | by David Rugendyke | Rocket Pool | Medium 2\n5. How is the rETH token currently used?\n\nBalancer LP of rETH/wETH 6 is the current primary use case of rETH with a liquidity of $53M\n\nUniswap V3 is second with $4.57M of liquidity\n\nrETH is also used as collateral on makerDAO to mint DAI\n\nimage\nimage\n1231×203 17.2 KB\nIt’s likely a Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of rETH holding.\n\nSee the community-maintained Defi Opportunities 7 document for additional use cases.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\nrETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH into Rocket Pool for staking.\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nrETH is minted when stakers deposit ETH into the Rocket Pool deposit pool, and rETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their ETH.\n\nThe Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities.\n8.

Enabling in isolation mode will likely not capture how rETH collateral will likely be used, and as a result, only delays the path towards understanding rETH dynamics on the Aave markets. Unless the definition of Isolation Mode includes correlated assets to rETH, we recommend against initializing in isolation mode.\n\nBorrowable - Yes\n\nWe are aware of the risk that comes with enabling small LSD borrowing. However, disabling borrowing for rETH (given the profile shown above) may be excessive and misses out on likely use cases for rETH. As demand for liquidity for liquid staking derivatives increases, disabling borrowing cuts off a potential revenue opportunity for Aave v3 - specifically WETH/wstETH supply + rETH borrowing. We believe a better way to balance this intrinsic risk and opportunity would be to allow borrowing rETH, thus giving the protocol an opportunity to explore this potential form of usage but mitigate tail risks via stringent borrow caps. This will allow rETH more time to evolve in the context of Aave’s markets.\n\nLT - 74%; LTV 67%\n\nWe recommend lower parameters compared to wstETH of 79.5% to capture this difference in collateral quality that we’ve identified above.\n\nLB - 7.5%\n\nWe recommend initializing with an LB of 7.5% to give liquidators slightly more incentive to liquidate rETH collateral, as compared to wstETH.\n\nRF - 15%\n\nLPF - 0.1\n\nDebt Ceiling - NA\n\nSupply Cap - 10K\n\nBorrow Cap - 1200\n\nOur analysis shows that initializing rETH with borrows enabled but with a stringent borrow cap - would be most beneficial to see how rETH evolves on the v3 markets.\n\n| Symbol | Isolation Mode | Borrowable | Collateral Enabled | LTV | LT | LB | RF | LPF | Debt Ceiling | Supply Cap | Borrow Cap |\n| ------ | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | --- | -- | -- | -- | --- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |\n| rETH   | NO             | YES        | YES                | 67% | 74%| 7.5%| 15%| 0.10| N/A         | 10K       | 1200      |\n\n\n## Interest Rate Curve and Reserve Factor\n\nrETH is similar to stETH, which has been listed on Ethereum v2 since last Spring, but since borrowing has always been disabled for stETH, we have no data about how users respond to changes in interest rates. As such, we recommend starting with conservative parameters that can be optimized later.\n\nParameter | Recommendation\n--------- | -------------\nBase | 0\nSlope 1 | 0.07\nUoptimal | 0.45\nSlope 2 | 3.0\nReserve Factor | 0.15\n\nUnder these parameters, the borrower interest rate increases linearly from 0% at 0% utilization to 7% at 45% utilization, and then linearly to 307% at 100% utilization. This interest rate curve matches that of the more volatile assets on Aave (1INCH, CRV, ENS, LINK, MKR, UNI). From a risk perspective, interest rate curves need to be designed to reduce the chances of utilization reaching 100%, which would prevent stakers from withdrawing rETH and prevent liquidators from seizing rETH collateral when performing liquidations. The proposed interest rate curve is thus desirable because it uses a low optimal utilization and has a high maximum interest rate.",

CVX is the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCVX is not currently listed on major lending markets, including CVX on the platform would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage. This has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earn asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around $578.04k at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance. Further details can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n##  Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nLlama Community has presented a proposal to deposit Aave community funds into Curve and Convex Finance. Listing CVX on Aave enables Aave to earn aCVX tokens which can then be used to support the treasury management proposal detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?**\n\nConvex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted $CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV.. Adding support for $CVX will in turn provide future opportunities as Convex will also support other protocols in time. ie: FXS\n\nCVX is the governance token of the Convex protocol. By locking $CRV for life on Convex, each user gives his veCRV voting power to vlCVX holders (CVX lockers). Every vlCVX holders can vote on Convex governance proposals but also Curve governance proposals and gauges weights (5.05 veCRV/vlCVX). In the future, each vlCVX holders will control voting power on other tokens like FXS (users already can lock for life FXS for cvxFXS but vlCVX holders cannot vote on Frax governance proposals and gauges weights).\n\n**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nCVX would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem. Adding CVX creates another use case outside of the Convex tokenomics model. Llama expects the CVX demand to be similar to CRV. Additionally:\n\n* Significant Borrow Demand: Users can borrow CVX and then either stake or lock the CVX token to earn yield. In addition to direct yield, investors may borrow CVX to lock and then influence how the inflation schedule of CRV and CVX is distributed. CRV has one of the highest utilisations and dollar value borrowed of all high volatility assets listed on Aave V2.\n* CVX holders can deposit (lend) CVX and then borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).\n\nLlama Community intends to use the aCVX revenue generated to support Treasury Management activities. In this instance, aCVX could be redeemed and locked on Convex to then influence how the CRV and CVX inflation schedule is distributed. Llama Community intends to use the CVX to support growing the Aave and sAave Curve liquidity pools.\n\nThere is $43.2M TVL on the sAAVE pool and $11.8M TVL on the AAVE pool on Convex.\n\nThe Convex community is looking forward to lending and borrowing CVX on Aave. The community will enjoy extra revenues from the reserve factor.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nConvex, as DeFi farmers themselves, the team needed a platform that allowed users to receive the max boost possible from CRV in a simplified manner and allow users to collect their actual rewards directly without auto-selling. They also believe CRV stakers should be rewarded more as they are effectively, mining together with Liquidity Providers. They intend to change that with Convex by charging a lower performance fee, returning fees back to the CRV stakers and CVX token holders, and distributing rewards directly.\n\nThe concept of Convex was published to the public on April 15, 2021 with the protocol launching on May 17, 2021.\n\n30th April 2021 - [Convex platform was whitelisted on the Curve platform](https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-57-whitelist-the-convex-protocol/1654%20and%20Vote%20results:%20https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/44)\n17th May 2022 - [Convex was released](https://convexfinance.medium.com/ready-set-go-69bd68019c5a)\n7th September 2021 - [CVX vote locking went live](https://convexfinance.medium.com/september-update-vote-locking-launch-liquidity-provider-incentives-and-more-1380f406f725)\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**\n\nThe CVX token governs over 559M$ worth of CRV locked in the protocol (and $4M worth of CVX in the Convex treasury multisig). CVX is currently only available on 2 Fuse pools, however there is no liquidity there.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThe emission schedule can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/tokenomics).\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nConvex multisig can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/multisig-admin-rights).\n\n**8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\n* Market capitalisation: $1.35B\n* Average daily volume on the 30 last days: $25,918,420.66\n* CVX is listed on many exchanges, the largest being Gate.io, Sushiswap, Uniswap and Binance Source: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance#markets](http://www.coingecko.com)\n* veCRV controlled /vlCVX: 5.05 veCRV/vlCVX\n\n**9.

This stablecoin has become one of the biggest in the market with a supply of 48.7m, a TVL in the protocol of $87m, and an average daily volume > $4m. \n\nagEUR can at the moment only be issued on Ethereum mainnet, but it can be bridged on many different chains. There is an ongoing governance proposal to deploy the protocol on Polygon allowing anyone to natively mint agEUR from there.\n\nAt the moment, the PoS bridge is the only way to bridge agEUR to Polygon. But with the potential upcoming launch of the borrowing module, new bridge solutions will be added, like Layer Zero.\n\nThere are so far more than 3m agEUR on Polygon with deep liquidity [on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/polygon/pools/0x3fa147d6309abeb5c1316f7d8a7d8bd023e0cd80) and on [Curve](https://polygon.curve.fi/factory/209). \nBesides Uniswap and Curve on Polygon, agEUR has deep liquidity on UniswapV3, Sushiswap and Curve on mainnet. The stablecoin can be minted at oracle value meaning liquidity for it could be theorically infinite.\n\nStablecoin is also available on Fantom, Harmony, BSC, Avalanche, Solana, NEAR, Aurora, Fuse, with plans for deployment on other chains where Aave is supported like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\nThe stablecoin is over-collateralized (current collateral ratio = 180%), it is backed by USDC, DAI, FEI and FRAX. The protocol insures itself against the $/€ change risk by issuing perpetual futures and by the deposits of another type of agent incentivized by the strategies built by the protocol (involving lending to Aave).\nThe protocol has also launched a new module that allows people to borrow agEUR against wETH, wstETH and wBTC. It is this version of the protocol that will deployed on Polygon and then on other chains.\n\n## Links\n\n- Official: https://angle.money\n- Docs: https://docs.angle.money\n- Token Contracts: [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1a7e4e63778b4f12a199c062f3efdd288afcbce8), [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xe0b52e49357fd4daf2c15e02058dce6bc0057db4).

This would provide a use case that exists nowhere else in DeFi around agEUR: the opportunity to long the € and short the $ through agEUR.\n\nRight now it is possible to borrow agEUR, but not to borrow from agEUR: like you could borrow USDC or another USD stablecoin, swap it for agEUR (with little slippage) and hence get a short on the $/long on the €. This may not be the trend of the moment but definitely something to consider for the future.\n\nRelative to the size of agEUR on Aave, there’s also agEUR liquidity available for this kind of opportunities at the moment.\n\nDoing this in isolation mode would mean this asset would induce very small risk for the Aave protocol as a whole.\n\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nWith the liquidity on Polygon in mind, I propose the following risk parameter linked to the isolation mode. Obviously this is a first proposition and governance/risk team is more suited to choose better risk parameters.\n\nV3 Isolation mode: 60% LTV, 80% liquidation threshold, 20% reserve factor, 3M$ debt ceiling. This is a conservative debt ceiling, given the mainnet liquidity we could also imagine efficient cross-chain liquidators coming to liquidate even if liquidity is too small on Polygon\n\n## Specifications \n\n**1.

Frax Protocol’s synthetic assets are strategic assets for Aave and the launch of V3 on mainnet introducing caps & emode allows to replicate the stETH success in a risk-averse environment for other LSDs assets.\n\nOnboarding frxETH is a source of additional revenue for Aave and benefits the ecosystem as a whole because these onboarding has an effect on assets liquidity & peg resilience.\n\nAave has the opportunity to help ecosystem diversity and decrease the concentration of liquidity to a unique entity while supporting more staking overall and increasing Ethereum decentralization.\n\nSpecification:\n\nWhat is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not related in any form nor paid by Frax Protocol to push this proposal. Increasing LSD diversity is part of the ACI delegate platform. The ACI received support from the Frax Protocol team to fill this proposal with relevant data and to answer sfrxETH-related questions.\n\nProvide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?\n\nFrax Protocol is a decentralized synthetic asset platform that allows users to mint and trade synthetic assets that track the value of real-world assets. frxETH is a synthetic token that represents exposure to Ethereum Staking. The sfrxETH token can be used to gain exposure to the staking of ETH and its revenue without actually the need to run a validating node. This allows users to access Staking ETH without having to hold a 32 ETH minimum and run a node infrastructure. Adding sfrxETH to the Aave V3 market as a reserve would bring additional diversity and liquidity to the ecosystem.\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nsfrxETH is a productive asset it appreciates in value over time based on the rewards generated by Frax node operators… Wherever ETH is presently used as collateral, sfrxETH would make a better collateral since it accrues the staking reward in addition to the underlying ETH value.\nsfrxETH is based on Ethereum staking returns and has a relatively low counterparty risk compared to other yield bearing tokens.\nsfrxETH is a good long-term holding collateral, but many people want the option to access the value now and so want to use it as collateral for loans.\nsfrxETH could be used in leverage and hedge trading strategies by borrowing/lending in Aave.\nsfrxETH is a standard ERC-20 token and does not rebase, and so it should be technically easier to integrate into Aave.\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nCore concepts to understand the unified Frax Finance ecosystem include:\n\nFractional – Frax is the first and only stablecoin with parts of its supply backed by collateral and parts of the supply algorithmically stabilized. The stablecoin (FRAX) is named after this hybrid fractional-reserve system.\n\nFraxswap, a native AMM – Fraxswap is the first AMM with time weighted average market maker orders used by the Frax Protocol for rebalancing collateral, mints/redemptions, expanding/contracting FRAX supply, and deploying protocol owned liquidity onchain.\n\nFraxlend, permissionless lending markets – Fraxlend is the lending facility for the FRAX & FPI stablecoins allowing debt origination, customized non-custodial loans, and onboarding collateral assets to the Frax Finance economy.\n\nCrypto Native CPI Stablecoin – Frax’s end vision is to build the most important decentralized stablecoins in the world. The Frax Price Index (FPI) stablecoin is the first stablecoin pegged to a basket of consumer goods creating its own unit of account separate from any nation state denominated money.\n\nFour Tokens – FRAX is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Frax Share (FXS) is the governance token of the entire Frax ecosystem of smart contracts which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value. FPI is the inflation resistant, CPI pegged stablecoin. FPIS is the governance token of the Frax Price Index and splits its value capture with FXS holders.\n\nGauge Rewards System – The community can propose new gauge rewards for strategies that integrate FRAX stablecoins. FXS emissions are fixed, halve each year, and entirely flow to different gauges based on the votes of veFXS stakers.\n\nFrax Ether: it is a liquid ETH staking derivative designed to uniquely leverage the Frax Finance ecosystem to maximize staking yield and smoothen the Ethereum staking process for a simplified, secure, and DeFi-native way to earn interest on ETH.\n\n5. How is the sfrxETH token currently used?\n\nFraxLend is the current primary use case of sfrxETH to be used as collateral, with a liquidity of $13.6M\n\nIt’s likely an Aave V3 onboarding will put Aave V3 in a top position of sfrxETH holding.\n\nsFrxETH is a yield-bearing Asset\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nThere is no emission schedule.\n\nsfrxETH is only minted when stakers deposit ETH to convert it to frxETH and then stake into frax protocol to obtain sfrxETH\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nsfrxETH is minted when stakers deposit frxETH into the Frax Protocol deposit pool, and sfrxETH is burnt when stakers withdraw their frxETH.\n\nThe Frax protocol contracts do have permissions that grant administrators mint/burn capabilities. This was pointed out in code4Arena audit 1.\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $60 192 819\n24H Volume ~$1.4M (frxETH/ETH on Curve)\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools\n\nExchanges:\n\nCurve (the main source of liquidity with frxETH/ETH, sfrxETH can be unstaked for frxETH)\nBalancer\nUniswap V3\nFurther information here: [Fill this]\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 850 members\nTwitter: 64.1k followers\nGithub: 67 followers\nTelegram: 14200 members\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment: 10-06-2022\nNumber of Transactions: 2958 transactions\nNumber of holders for token: 858 holders (liquidity pools are recorded as 1 address)\nTechnical Specifications\nsfrxETH\nsfrxETH is a ERC-4626 vault designed to accrue the staking yield of the Frax ETH validators. At any time, frxETH can be exchanged for sfrxETH by depositing it into the sfrxETH vault, which allows users to earn staking yield on their frxETH. Over time, as validators accrue staking yield, an equivalent amount of frxETH is minted and added to the vault, allowing users to redeem their sfrxETH for a greater amount of frxETH than they deposited. The exhange rate of frxETH per sfrxETH increases over time as staking rewards are added to the vault. By holding sfrxETH you hold a % claim on an increasing amount of the vault’s frxETH, splitting staking rewards up among sfrxETH holders proportional to their share of the total sfrxETH. This is similar to other auto-compounding tokens like Aave’s aUSDC.\n\nSecurity Considerations\nFrax Finance smart contracts have been independently audited by :\n\nCode4Arena\nbug bounty:\n\nThe bounty is simply calculated as the lower value of 10% of the total possible exploit or $10m worth paid in FRAX+FXS (evenly split). https://docs.frax.finance/smart-contracts/miscellaneous 1\n\nRisk parameters\nWhile we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams Gauntlet (@Pauljlei) & @ChaosLabs, the ACI suggests the following risk parameters to start the conversation. These parameters define a non-borrowable asset with a 67% LTV.\n\nbecause sfrxETH has limited supply and liquidity compared to stETH and rETH,\n\nand because, as of now, minting permissions are not strictly limited, a supply cap is added in this proposal to limit protocol exposure to this asset\n\nadditionally, the current maturity of sfrxETH is not considered fit by the ACI to be a candidate for emode.\n\nThe ACI invites the community to follow the evolution of sfrxETH and consider adjusting mid-term the risk parameters of sfrxETH.\n\nThis will make sfrxETH slightly less attractive than stETH, rETH & cbETH but reflect the difference in liquidity between them.\n\nSymbol: sfrxETH\n\nIsolation Mode: NO\n\nBorrowable: NO\n\nCollateral Enabled: YES\n\nemode: NO\n\nLTV: 67%\n\nLT: 74%\n\nLB: 7.5%\n\nRF: N/A\n\nLPF: 0.10\n\nDebt Ceiling: N/A\n\nSupply Cap: 5k\n\nBorrow Cap: N/A",
