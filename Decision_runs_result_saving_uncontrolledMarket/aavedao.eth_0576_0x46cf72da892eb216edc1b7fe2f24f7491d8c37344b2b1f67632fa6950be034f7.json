With a TVL of approximately $5 billion, BNB Chain is the third-largest chain by TVL. The chain has a diverse array of DeFi offerings, including prominent projects like PancakeSwap, Venus, and several others. Deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain could provide opportunities for growth and collaboration between the Aave and BNB Chain communities.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain has the potential to benefit both Aave and BNB Chain ecosystems. Aave would gain access to BNB Chain's user base, DeFi ecosystem, and the potential for additional revenue. BNB Chain would benefit from having a flagship DeFi project like Aave on its platform, further diversifying DeFi options available to its users.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the BNB Chain with a selection of suitable assets for collateral, including BNB, WBTC, BETH, WETH, USDC, and USDT. Suggested risk parameters for each asset are provided in the table below. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\n| Risk Parameter | BNB | WBTC | BETH | WETH | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 65% | 70% | 60% | 80% | 82.5% | 70% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 70% | 75% | 70% | 82.5% | 85% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 10% | 10% | 5% | 5% | 5% | 8.5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 15% | 15% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | N/A | 80.000 | 20,000,000 | 20.000.000 |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 | 5,000 | 20,000 | 100,000 | 50,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| uOptimal | 75% | 45% | 45% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 6.1% | 7% | 7% | 4.8% | 4% | 4% |\n| Slope2 | 100% | 300% | 300% | 80% | 80% | 80% |\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form by Binance & BNB for creating this Temperature Check proposal. This TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\nAt the time of writing, the author owns ~75$ worth of assets on the BNB chain.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\nTemperature Check: Gather community feedback and assess sentiment towards the proposal of deploying Aave V3 on BNB Chain.\n\nARFC: If the Temperature Check Snapshot indicates positive sentiment, proceed to the ARFC stage for further discussion, risk parameter evaluation network analysis and finalization of the proposal.\n\nAIP: If the ARFC stage Snapshot is successful, submit the proposal as an AIP for voting and on-chain governance approval.",

This testnet deployment was done for testing purposes by the @AaveCompanies team.\n\nSince ZkEVM is EVM-equivalent, deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work.\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative supports L2 diversity as part of its governance platform.\n\nThis minimal Aave V3 deployment, with strictly limited assets onboarding (”MVP V3”), can be an opportunity to establish a strategic Aave presence early in this new network while staying conservative in terms of risk.\n\nThis ARFC proposal should be considered as a \"temperature check\" that would allow development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the zkEVM network.\n\n# **Abstract**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with an opportunity to “temp check” the deployment of a MVP version of Aave V3 on the ZkEVM L2.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe proposal to deploy Aave V3.0.1 on the ZkEVM L2 network, also known as \"MVP V3,\" presents an opportunity for Aave Governance to establish a strategic presence on this new network early on. Aave has a history of pioneering in new frontiers, starting with the Polygon & Avalanche V2 deployment in 2021.\n\nZkEVM is an L2 solution developed by the Polygon team that is EVM-equivalent. Deploying Aave V3 would require minimal development work. However, to reduce risk, the proposal suggests limiting asset onboarding and setting conservative risk parameters. This will enable development and risk service providers to conduct a deeper analysis of the ZkEVM network. The proposal recommends onboarding only three collaterals (WETH, WMATIC & USDC) and one borrowable asset (USDC) to reduce risk exposure.\n\nIt is important to note that the presented risk parameters should be considered as suggestions to start the conversation. The ACI invites risk service providers teams to provide feedback on them.\n\nThis proposal also lays the groundwork for an \"MVP\" L2 GHO facilitator if governance considers this option in the future.\n\nOverall, this proposal has the potential to expand Aave's reach in the DeFi space by allowing it to expand to new \"frontier\" networks.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis ARFC presents the Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy an “MVP V3” of Aave V3.0.1 with only three collaterals: WETH, WMATIC & USDC, and only one borrowable asset: USDC.\n\n| Risk Parameter | WETH | MATIC | USDC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO | NO | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO | NO | YES |\n| Enable Collateral | YES | YES | YES |\n| Stable borrowing | N/A | N/A | NO |\n| Emode Category | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Loan To Value | 80% | 65% | 82.5% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 82.5% | 70% | 85% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 5% | 10% | 5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Borrow Cap | N/A | N/A | 20,000,000 |\n| Supply Cap | 25,000 | 15,000,000 | 50,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n| Slope1 | 7% | 6.1% | 4% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% | 75% | 90% |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 100% | 60% |\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by Polygon for publishing this AFRC.\n\nHowever, Marc Zeller, the founder of ACI, is a compensated DeFi strategy advisor for the Polygon Foundation. Although this AFRC is not specifically part of his role, it could be interpreted as such.\n\nAs part of its delegate platform, the ACI promotes L2 diversity.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Marc Zeller holds MATIC, the native asset of the Polygon protocol, and MaticX, a LSD of MATIC, as well as significant holdings on the Polygon POS blockchain, worth approximately $250k.\n\n# **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Add MKR to Ethereum v3\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consulting (@matthewgraham), ACI (@MarcZeller) and 3SE\nDated: 2023-02-18\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard MKR to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nMKR is the governance token of the Maker DAO ecosystem. MKR token holders govern the Maker Protocol, the smart contracts that power DAI. There is currently $12.71m of MKR deposited into Aave v2 on Ethereum. This proposal grants Aave the opportunity to list the governance token of the community supporting DAI which contributes $167m of TVL on the Ethereum v2 deployment.\n\nThis ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting.\n\n# Motivation\n\nMaker DAO has over $7.45B in TVL and is ranked second on Defi Llama TVL rankings. The Maker Protocol is only deployed on the Ethereum network. The stable coin DAI, provides $167m of deposits into Aave v2 on Ethereum, with over $103m of this supply being borrowed by users.\n\nThe risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlet’s original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don’t create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates.\n\nWe note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: MKR\n\nContract Address: [0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|65.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|70.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|8.50%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|1,500|\n|Supply Cap|6,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|$2,500,000|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n\nNote: Stable borrowing is disabled, however parameters are provided in case stable borrowing is enabled at a later date without amending any parameters.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

UNI was one of the first governance tokens to be integrated into the Aave ecosystem when it was listed on v1 and was included on Aave v2 when it was launched in December 2020.\n\nThis ARFC is a joint effort with ACI and 3SE to allow a selection of v2 listed assets to be onboarded on V3 via the governance process. Subject to a favourable Snapshot vote, Llama will submit an AIP for voting.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUniswap is a DEX with $4.18B in TVL, second only to Curve Finance with $5.06B, according to Defi Llama’s data. Uniswap is deployed on five networks. UNI provides Aave v2 with $15.86m of TVL. Something to note, it is possible with Aave v3 to delegate Aave’s UNI reserve holding governance influence to an address which can be used for voting on Uniswap proposals.\n\nThe risk parameters provided here within are from Gauntlet’s original Aave v3 initial [assets listings and configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) forum thread. These parameters are to be revised by Gauntlet and feedback will be incorporated before progressing to a Snapshot vote.\n\nThe interest rate provided in the proposal mirrors the v2 deployment with exception of the parameters specific to stable interest rates. The stable rates proposed are the somewhat generic listing rates as stable borrowing is disabled. However, if stable borrowing was enabled, the suggested parameters are suitable and don’t create any undesirable dynamics between stable and variable rates.\n\nWe note that this proposal is to be reviewed by Gauntlet, with feedback to be incorporated, prior to progressing to Snapshot.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: UNI\n\nContract Address: [0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|65.00%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|77.00%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|10.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|20.00%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Borrow Cap|500,000 units|\n|Supply Cap|2,000,000 units|\n|Debt Ceiling|$17,000,000|\n|Variable Base|0.00%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|13.00%|\n|Stable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3.00%|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5.00%|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20.00%|\n\nNote: Stable borrowing is disabled, however parameters are provided in case stable borrowing is enabled at a later date without amending any parameters.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Add BAL Ethereum v3\nAuthor: @Llamaxyz - DeFi_Consultants & @solarcurve (Balancer DAO)\nDated: 2023-01-31\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal presents Aave the opportunity to onboard BAL to the Ethereum v3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n# Abstract\n\nBAL is a strategic asset to Aave and any BAL earned from the pool could be used by Aave to bootstrap the adoption of GHO and/or the new aToken being developed by @AaveCompanies.\n\nThe risk parameters provided within are the same as those provided by Gauntlet within the [initial forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) discussing which assets to onboard to v3 Ethereum.\n\nBy presenting each asset to be onboarded to v3 Ethereum individually, the community can focus on a specific asset, with individual Snapshots determining how to proceed. Finally, approved assets listings can be grouped for the on-chain AIP vote.\n\n# Motivation\n\nListing BAL as a priority for Aave v3 reflects the strategic relationship between the two communities. Balancer and Aave completed a [200,000 BAL for AAVE token swap](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/87/) and Aave later purchased an additional [100,000 BAL via a swap contract](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/115/). With the launch of [GHO ](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-development-update/10267)getting closer and the [new aToken](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406) from @AaveCompanies currently in queue for audit, the potential use cases for veBAL are numerous.\n\nDue to the potential use cases for veBAL in supporting bootstrap the growth of Aave, the BAL token is considered a strategic asset. Therefore, we believe listing BAL on Aave v3 Ethereum is a priority.\n\nBalancer DAO is a large provider of liquidity on Ethereum v2 and also Polygon v3. A proposal by @llamaxyz for Balancer to deposit [additional BAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-164-deposit-bal-into-aave-polygon-v3/4295) into Polygon v3, up to the current SupplyCap, was recently approved by Balancer DAO.\n\n![\\ 301x183](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/TZTd4ME5QCWDn4QEX1LBlBXodWExL-NKJMrKaB3MDQGtixZhk9cNhtChax0ZV11SvSvtcALlWCPOG2wVUC0dGAHjKeB5baY2unhodAufQt51ONoZSTBOTFPVEXDvRg_O6HYu9Z3WydTumJUSHk8t5l0) ![\\ 303x181](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6KxbH6MUdPdvoU4PbSKSutQZbnkfVtwj7cVpfWhSix3-vC8AF9zllQt4sp6P8nP4jmRcJ3KRs0Of1CPtBqCfPCd8OaAgHVAZSFlDYxskkHfL2S_oECl5NqL-6ex0S7RhSeHVnhmQDk66_865w0PXA-M)\n\nFor listing BAL, this proposal uses risk parameters suggested by Gauntlet on the original [[ARC] Aave v3 Ethereum Deployment: Assets and Configurations](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-aave-v3-ethereum-deployment-assets-and-configurations/10238/22) post. The interest rate curve parameters have been sourced from @Llamaxyz’s [[ARFC] BAL Interest Rate Curve Upgrade](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bal-interest-rate-curve-upgrade/10484) post, which has passed through Snapshot.\n\n# Specification\n\nTicker: BAL\n\nContract Address: [0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D](https://etherscan.io/address/0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3d)\n\n|Risk Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Isolation Mode|YES|\n|Enable Borrow|YES|\n|Enable Collateral|YES|\n|Loan To Value|57%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|62%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|8.3%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10%|\n|Borrow Cap|185k|\n|Supply Cap|700k|\n|Debt Ceiling|2.9m|\n|Variable Base|3%|\n|Variable Slope1|14%|\n|Variable Slope2|150%|\n|Uoptimal|80%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Stable Slope1|20%|\n|Stable Slope2|150%|\n|Base Stable Rate Offset|3|\n|Stable Rate Excess Offset|5|\n|Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio|20|\n\nNote: Stable borrowing is disabled, however parameters are provided in case enabled at a later date without amending other parameters specific to stable borrowing.
