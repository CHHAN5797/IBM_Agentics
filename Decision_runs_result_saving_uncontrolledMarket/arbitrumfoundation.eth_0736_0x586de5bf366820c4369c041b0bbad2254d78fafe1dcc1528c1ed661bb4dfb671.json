        "body": "## Abstract\n\nThe RARI DAO seeks to enhance its governance framework by upgrading the RARI token contract and bringing its governance from Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum ecosystem. This proposal requests a custom gateway for a new RARI L2 token contract via Arbitrum native bridge, as only the Arbitrum DAO can implement this change. The custom gateway will enable more efficient governance processes for while reducing user costs and improving overall accessibility for RARI DAO. The proposal asks to register the custom L2 token to a custom gateway on the Arbitrum native bridge.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRARI DAO is governed by the $RARI token, which when locked in veRARI grants voting access. The current token contract is on Ethereum mainnet and is not upgradable. The RARI DAO wishes to upgrade its governance, a part of which is a token contract upgrade with snapshots and delegations embedded. Only the Arbitrum DAO can however set up the mapping of L1 -> L2 token addresses in the custom gateway (which is controlled by Arbitrum DAO)  on the Arbitrum native bridge. Here is more information about the topic: https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/token-bridging/token-bridge-erc20#setting-up-your-token-with-the-generic-custom-gateway\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe RARI DAO multichain governance upgrade is designed to make governance more accessible by simplifying the UX, reducing gas fees, and enabling new token functions. This aligns with Artbitrum's commitment to user-centricity and technical inclusivity.\n\nWith a custom L2 token implementation we will be able to perform the RARI DAO governance upgrade and move our governance fully into the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nMore on RARI DAO's plan for governance upgrade can be found HERE.\n\n## Key Terms\n\nRARI token: RARI DAO governance token (https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf\n\nRARI DAO: body governing the Rarible Protocol and RARI chain\n\nCustom L2 RARI token: upgraded and simplified RARI token to be used in RARI DAO multichain governance moving forward\n\n## Specifications\n\nRARI token in question (https://etherscan.io/token/0xfca59cd816ab1ead66534d82bc21e7515ce441cf) does not have upgradability nor allows the owner to register in the Arbitrum token bridge router.\n\nAs such, we're requesting a custom L2 token implementation and using the (standard) custom gateway. Lacking the ability to upgrade / owner-register, we are seeking Artbirum DAO's approval to register the upgraded RARI token to the custom gateway so we can proceed with the custom L2 implementation.\n\nThe upgraded token contract was fully audited and can be found here: [https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/pull/305).\n\nToken contract was deployed to Arbitrum Sepolia, RARI testnet (which is on top of Arbitrum Sepolia) and all contracts were tested manually as well.\n\nRARI DAO voted in favor of the upgraded token: https://www.tally.xyz/gov/rari-foundation/proposal/85102068202527969889208024703113668965813715410446115075088330064807449302588\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\n1. Deploy token contracts on Arbitrum and RARI chains (done)\n2. Security audit of the proposed code change (in progress by Arbitrum Foundation)\n3. Onchain vote to change mapping for L1 → L2 tokens on bridge router and custom gateway (This can be done only by Arbitrum DAO)\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplementation upon the proposal's execution (aiming late September).\n\n## Overall costs\n\nN/A",

        "body": "### Constitutional\n\n### Abstract\n\nSKY has launched support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on Arbitrum. This proposal requests Arbitrum DAO to register the Sky Custom Gateway contracts in the Router contracts to allow users bridging USDS and sUSDS through the official Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSKY has formally introduced support for USDS and sUSDS tokens on the Arbitrum network, and Spark is set to soon launch Spark Liquidity Layer and Spark Savings (https://spark.fi). The Spark Liquidity Layer will deploy liquidity on Arbitrum to provide slippage-free liquidity for USDC, USDS, and sUSDS tokens natively through a Peg Stability Module (PSM). Arbitrum users will have access to this through Spark Savings (https://app.spark.fi/), enabling stablecoin holders to earn the Sky Savings Rate.\n\nThe Arbitrum Ecosystem’s Router contracts maintain a list of gateways used for bridging various L1/L2 tokens to/from Arbitrum. The Arbitrum Bridge UI relies on the routers for gateway information when bridging tokens. Currently, USDS and sUSDS tokens are routed through the default gateways rather than the Sky Custom Gateways. As a result, the Arbitrum team has disabled bridging USDS and sUSDS through the Arbitrum Bridge, creating a suboptimal UX. This means that users will have access to USDS and sUSDS on Arbitrum, and Spark will deploy liquidity there, however, they won’t be able to use the Arbitrum Bridge UI to transfer USDS and sUSDS to Arbitrum.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal seeks to update the Router configuration to utilize the Sky Custom Gateways for USDS and sUSDS tokens that are live on Arbitrum, ensuring users receive the official token versions when they use the Router contracts through the Arbitrum Bridge UI.\n\n### Sky Custom Gateway\n\nThe Sky Custom L1 Gateway on Arbitrum currently bridges USDS and sUSDS tokens from Ethereum to Arbitrum. Sky Custom Gateways are designed to enable Sky governance to extend support to new Sky ecosystem tokens in the future and also perform essential maintenance operations, such as bridge or token upgrades. Additionally, the Sky Custom L1 Gateway leverages a pre-deployed Escrow contract, which is also used by the DAI token, one of the first tokens bridged to Arbitrum.\n\n### Key terms\n\nUSDS – Stablecoin\n\nsUSDS – Savings USDS (Stablecoin + Yield)\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Current Status\n\nThe Sky Custom Bridge, along with USDS and sUSDS tokens, is currently live on Arbitrum and available for end-user access. Additionally, Spark is set to deploy significant stablecoins liquidity (USDC, USDS and sUSDS) through the Spark Liquidity Layer and will launch Spark Savings, allowing Arbitrum stablecoin holders to access the Sky Saving Rate (available at https://app.spark.fi/) \n- USDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xdC035D45d973E3EC169d2276DDab16f1e407384F\n\n- sUSDS address on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3931d71877C0E7a3148CB7Eb4463524FEc27fbD\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Ethereum - https://etherscan.io/address/0x84b9700e28b23f873b82c1beb23d86c091b6079e\n\n- Sky Custom Gateway on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x13f7f24ca959359a4d710d32c715d4bce273c793\n\n- Official USDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0x6491c05a82219b8d1479057361ff1654749b876b\n\n- Official sUSDS address on Arbitrum - https://arbiscan.io/token/0xdDb46999F8891663a8F2828d25298f70416d7610\n\nThe code for the Sky custom gateways been audited by ChainSecurity and Cantina, more details can be found on the following links\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241009-ChainSecurity_MakerDAO_Arbitrum_Token_Bridge_audit.pdf\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/blob/master/audit/20241023-cantina-report-maker-arbitrum-token-bridge.pdf\n\nAdditionally, Certora was used to formally verify the code, all the formal verification specifications can be found here\nhttps://github.com/makerdao/arbitrum-token-bridge/tree/master/certora\n\nSky Ecosystem maintains a set of general emergency response procedures to handle urgent situations like exploits. While this document isn’t gateway-specific, you can view the Sky Atlas Emergency Response System, maintained by Powerhouse, here:\nhttps://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.1.8_Emergency_Response_System/a1c2d773-f5f9-4e17-9da4-edd82ea4140b%7C0db3\n\n\n\n### Deployment Details\n\nWe propose the execution of the setGateways method [1] on the L1GatewayRouter contract [2] on Ethereum for both USDS and sUSDS tokens. This action will register the official USDS and sUSDS tokens along with the Sky Custom Gateway contracts on the Router. Upon approval, the Sky team will collaborate with Offchain Labs to develop and submit an executable proposal for a DAO vote.\n\n[1] https://github.com/OffchainLabs/token-bridge-contracts/blob/5bdf33259d2d9ae52ddc69bc5a9cbc558c4c40c7/contracts/tokenbridge/ethereum/gateway/L1GatewayRouter.sol#L208\n\n[2] https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef\n\n### Overall Costs\n\nThere are no direct additional costs associated with this proposal. However it requires technical work being done by Offchain Labs and the Sky team. Both entities are aware of this proposal and ready to execute it.",

        "body": "### **Abstract**\n\nThis AIP seeks to propose changes to the structure of the security council so Arbitrum can maintain the “Stage 1” designation as per L2BEAT and not fall back to “Stage 0” designation.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nOn December 7, [L2BEAT published an update](https://medium.com/l2beat/stages-update-security-council-requirements-4c79cea8ef52) to the security council requirements for the [Stages Framework](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe). The requirements were updated after a lot of research and feedback to make Stages more formal and precise. \n\n### **Rationale**\n\nUpgrading the security council as per the Stage 1 requirements set by L2BEAT, will help ensure Arbitrum remains decentralized, but properly secured. See ‘Specifications’ for more details.\n\n### **Key Terms**\n\n**Stages:** A framework, inspired by [Vitalik’s proposed milestones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-milestones-for-rollups-taking-off-training-wheels/11571), that categorises rollups into three distinct stages based on their reliance on these training wheels. You can learn [more about the Stages framework here](https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe).\n\n**Security Council:** A group of 12 individuals who are responsible for addressing risks to the Arbitrum ecosystem through the selective application of **e**mergency actions and non-emergency actions. Learn more in [the ArbitrumDAO Docs](https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/concepts/security-council).\n\n**Timelock:** Smart contracts which implement a delay between an upgrade confirmation and execution.\n\n**Exit Window:** The actual time users have to exit the system in case of an unwanted upgrade.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nArbitrum currently has two multisigs and they both contain the same set of members:\n\na) A 9/12 multisig with instant upgrade power \n\nb) A 7/12 multisig that can upgrade with a 3+7+3 days delay \n\nWhile the higher threshold multisig can be classified as a Security Council, the lower one is below the minimum threshold and it’s considered a simple multisig according to the Stages framework introduced above.\n\nFor normal multisigs, L2BEAT requires at least a 7 days exit window for users. The current exit window for Arbitrum is 2 days (see [this thread](https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1737840485967032739?s=20) for a quick explanation).\n\nMoreover, the higher threshold multisig is supposed to stop malicious upgrades attempted by the lower threshold multisig. However, since the member set is the same, if the lower threshold agrees on something there are not enough members in the higher threshold to stop them, which means that the actual security of the upgradeability mechanism boils down to the 7/12 threshold.\n\nFor the above reason, technically, with the updated requirements for Stages, Arbitrum falls back to the Stage 0 designation. Since we know that it takes time to upgrade Arbitrum, we decided to leave the Stage 1 designation with the promise of addressing the above issues in a timely manner. This proposal is about addressing the issues and moving them to be voted on by the DAO.\n\n**Proposed Solutions**\n\n1) The **first solution** would be to remove the lower threshold (7/12) multisig entirely. This can be done in two ways:\n\n1. The contract is removed which requires an on-chain upgrade, or,\n2. The lower threshold multisig increases its threshold from 7/12 to 9/12 which requires no upgrade.\n\nIncreasing the threshold gives us the flexibility to restore a lower threshold in the future should the need arise, and it’s also a very quick and easy fix since it doesn’t require an on-chain upgrade.\n\nOn the other hand, removing the dependency on the lower threshold mutlisig for all the contracts in Arbitrum is a broad and potentially risky change. Therefore we suggest raising the threshold for the time being and revisiting the removal of all the dependencies at a later date if needed.\n\n2) The **second solution** would be to leave the lower threshold multisig as it is, but to increase the exit window to 7 days. In practice, this involves increasing the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days, since there is a 1 day max delay to force transactions on Arbitrum via L1 using the ‘DelayedInbox’. Increasing the L1 Timelock would not be very beneficial due to delay attacks on the fraud proof systems, since, even with BoLD,  the challenge period would end up being up to [16 days](https://x.com/DZack23/status/1737864854059335905?s=20).\n\n3) The **third solution**, which is not strictly required by the Stages Framework for the Stage 1 designation, is to both remove the lower threshold multisig entirely and increase the L2 Timelock delay so users have more time to exit in case of unwanted upgrades, increasing the security of the system even more.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n\nFollowing a week of discussion of this RFC, the proposal will go for a vote on Snapshot with the following 6 options (as they are or slightly adjusted), and/or any additional ones, should they arise from the discussion during the RFC phase:\n\n1. Increase the threshold from 7/12 to 9/12.\n2. Increase the L2 timelock delay from 3 days to 8 days.\n3. Increase the threshold and the L2 timelock delay.\n4. Make no changes.\n\nFollowing the temp-check, if any of the aforementioned options apart from No.4 is the most popular, the proposal will move to on-chain vote to execute the proposal.\n\n### **Overall Cost**\n\nThere’s no overhead to the DAO for the implementation of this proposal.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\n**RFC -** January 11th to January 18th\n\n**Snapshot -** January 18th to January 25th\n\n**On-Chain Vote:** January 30th to February 13th\n\n**Execution Delay:**\n\n- February 13th to February 16th - L2 Waiting Period\n- February 16th to February 23rd - L2-to-L1 Message\n- February 23rd to February 27th - L1 Waiting Period\n\n**Please note the aforementioned timeline is tentative and the actual timeline might be slightly different.**",

        "body": "# Abstract\n\nThis AIP proposes a reduction of the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5%, lowering it from 5% to 4.5% of the [total Arbitrum votable tokens](https://dune.com/queries/4629041/7761813). The goal is to ensure that well-supported proposals can successfully conclude by aligning quorum requirements with current levels of voter participation, reducing the risk of legitimate initiatives failing due to quorum thresholds not being met.\n\nFor non-constitutional proposals, the existing 3% quorum threshold will remain unchanged.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past year, the 5% quorum threshold for constitutional proposals within the ArbitrumDAO has been challenging, despite support from a broad range of delegates. As the circulating supply of $ARB continues to grow and voter turnout remains relatively flat, quorum requirements are becoming increasingly difficult to meet. \n[ARDC research on governance risks analysis](https://loving-bank-303.notion.site/Part-2-Governance-Risks-Analysis-1b605ac99aec80c282c7fa0105f13ce7) suggest that quorum on constitutional proposals could reach 300M (in base case) in about a year, while participation rate as % of votable supply has gone down from 8% in early 2024 to 4-5% in early 2025. Reducing the constitutional quorum threshold by 0.5% provides a short-term adjustment that enables critical governance to move forward while longer-term reforms are considered and developed.\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nArbitrumDAO is governed by the principles of decentralization, participation, and credible neutrality. This proposal balances those principles by modestly reducing the constitutional quorum threshold to better reflect the current governance environment without undermining the legitimacy of approved proposals. This proposal also would not require any upgrades to existing smart contracts, helping maintain community trust and operational simplicity.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction was selected as a conservative adjustment that is expected to meaningfully improve the likelihood of well-supported proposals reaching quorum, while still maintaining a high enough threshold to deter governance attacks.\n\n# Key Terms\n\n* Constitutional Proposal: A type of proposal within the ArbitrumDAO that modifies governance structures outlined in the ArbitrumDAO Constitution. These require higher quorum thresholds than non-Constitutional proposals.\n\n* Quorum: The minimum number of tokens required to participate in voting for a proposal to be valid and eligible to pass. In this context, it is calculated as a percentage of the total $ARB votable tokens.\n\n# Specifications\n\nThis proposal updates the constitutional quorum threshold from 5% of the total votable tokens to 4.5%.\n\nAs of April 2025, with ~4.3B ARB in votable tokens (formula is total supply of ARB token, which is 10B, minus the amount delegated to the [exclude address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x00000000000000000000000000000000000a4b86)), the quorum reduction would decrease the requirement by approximately 25 million ARB tokens, bringing the effective quorum from ~215M to ~190M ARB.\n\nNo upgrades to core governance smart contracts are required. Instead, this proposal will include an action contract that uses existing functionality to modify the quorum constant used in the calculation of constitutional quorum thresholds. The action contract will need to be audited, and this is expected to take 1 day.\n\nThe 0.5% reduction represents a minimal-risk, fast-to-implement interim solution, while other long-term solutions can be considered, such as flexible quorum, or franchiser contract.\n\n# Steps to Implement\n\nThe proposal will follow these steps:\n\n1. Forum discussion: This AIP is posted to the ArbitrumDAO forum for discussion and feedback from the community. [DONE]\n2. Temperature Check: An informal offchain vote is conducted on Snapshot to gauge community support. [ON-GOING]\n3. On-Chain Vote: A formal Constitutional AIP and call-to-vote is proposed to Tally for the on-chain vote. This proposal itself will be subject to the existing 5% quorum to pass.\n4. Update Governance Parameters: If passed, the new 4.5% quorum requirement would take effect immediately for all future constitutional proposals.\n\nNo smart contract changes or audits are required, which reduces implementation complexity and cost.\n\n# Overall Cost\n\nThis AIP does not request any grant or budget allocation. It introduces no operational, technical, or recurring costs and does not require smart contract upgrades or audits. Governance configuration changes are handled via on-chain proposal execution and incur only the standard gas costs associated with DAO transactions.",
