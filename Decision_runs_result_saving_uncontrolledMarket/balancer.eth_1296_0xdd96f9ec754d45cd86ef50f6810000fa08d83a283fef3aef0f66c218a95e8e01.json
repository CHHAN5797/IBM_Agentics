        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/844\n\n**Summary:**\n> This is a proposal on behalf of GenesisLRT to enable a gauge for genETH/wstETH on Ethereum. genETH is Genesis' Restaked Token, obtained through GenesisLRT’s restaking mechanism and platform.\nGenesisLRT offers a revolutionary process called 'Restaking' that supercharges users’\nETH by enabling them to stake their ETH on not just one, but multiple networks at once,\nthereby maximizing their rewards.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n    • Website: https://www.genesislrt.com/\n    • Documentation: https://docs.genesislrt.com/\n    • Github Page: https://github.com/genesislrt/contracts\n    • Communities: https://twitter.com/Genesis_LRT, Discord: https://discord.com/invite/DCTWmhgBXr\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> GenesisLRT offers a revolutionary process called 'Restaking' that supercharges users’\nETH by enabling them to stake their ETH on not just one, but multiple networks at once,\nthereby maximizing their rewards. It applies a novel concept called “EigenLayer” to\nempower users to restake their assets, whether it’s pure ETH or liquid staking tokens\n(LSTs) from their existing stake. This not only earns them extra profits but also bolsters\nthe security of the network. Additionally, Genesis allows users to unlock the restaked\nliquidity with the liquid restaked token genETH.\n\n>With Genesis, users will have the possibility to have a customizable restaking\nexperience by being able to choose his or her operators, validators and AVSs (Actively\nValidated Service). Genesis will ensure that the user will always have the best\nexperience and yields available in the market.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> GenesisLRT aims to enable a gauge for genETH/wstETH to substantially increase the liquidity of genETH, while supporting its utility and viability for integration into a range of DeFi protocols.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** \n- Delegate Voting: Participate in the selection of the best EigenLayerLs Node Operators to boost rewards on restaked assets, and general protocol governance. \n- Choosing validators, operators and AVSs involved in the Restaking process and their respective delegation strategy.\n- The more votes a pool gets, the more JEN token rewards\nwill be allocated to it_ the more TVL a pool gets, the more JEN token rewards will be\nallocated to it.\n\n2. **Oracles:** Still to be deployed. Rate provider - [genETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf073bac22dab7faf4a3dd6c6189a70d54110525c#code)\n\n3. **Audits:** GenesisLRT undergoes security audits and checks to ensure the safety of user funds. Latest by Veridise: [Audit](https://www.genesislrt.com/assets/files/VAR_GenesisLRT_231221-V1.pdf)\n\n4. **Centralization vectors:** The GenesisLRT Litepaper introduced the vision for Genesis as a decentralized system where independent node operators work to power the growth and development of Web3.

As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.\n> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implements the agreed-upon changes to the platform.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/598\n\n**Summary:**\n\n> Ankr proposes to the Balancer community the creation of a stETH/ankrETH on Polygon zkEVM with the Auto-bribing feature.\n> ankrETH is a form of ETH Liquid Staking from Ankr Staking that offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect your ankrETH tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards with auto-bribes.\n> Ankr is a leader in RPC nodes with projects like Aave, 1inch and SushiSwap as clients and has ~$100M TVL across the Liquid Staking Offering.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n> • Website: https://www.ankr.com/\n> • Documentation: [Ankr Staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/overview/)\n> • Github Page : [Ankr · GitHub](https://github.com/Ankr-network)\n> • Twitter: https://twitter.com/ankr https://twitter.com/ankrstaking\n> • Reddit: [Reddit - Dive into anything](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ankrofficial/)\n> • Telegram: Contact @ankrnetwork\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> Ethereum Liquid Staking as provided by Ankr Staking offers instant liquidity for your staked ETH, enabling you to connect your ankrETH tokens with DeFi platforms and earn several more layers of rewards.\n> ankrETH is a reward-bearing token, meaning that the fair value of 1 ankrETH token vs. ETH increases over time as staking rewards accumulate.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> The purpose of this proposal is to allow this pool to qualify for BAL incentive distribution in order to deepen the liquidity on Balancer and allow for users to swap ankrETH, the ETH Liquid Staking Asset, for ETH with the help of Auto-bribes on hidden hand.\n> The intuition behind this is to remedy the capital inefficiency associated with providing liquidity since ankrETH is generating a yield from the Staking Rewards of ETH. As a result, users have an opportunity cost when providing liquidity since the other half of the ETH they provide does not generate any yield.\n> Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize BAL incentives,Swap Fees and auto-bribes in order to mitigate this capital inefficiency effect.\n\n**Specifications:**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** ANKR token-holders can propose and vote for changes to the Ankr Staking system. If a change receives enough votes, the Ankr team implements the agreed-upon changes to the platform.

The full audit report may be found below:\n> [Ethereum Liquid Staking – Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/docs/staking/liquid-staking/eth/overview/#audit-details)\n> 4. **Centralization vectors:** Centralisation Vectors: The Ankr 2.0 whitepaper introduced the vision for Ankr Network as a decentralized system where independent node operators work alongside Ankr nodes to power the growth and development of Web3.
