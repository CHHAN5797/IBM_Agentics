        "body": "### [ARFC] Increase Community Preference For Supply Cap Limits\n\n### **Author: ACI**\n\n### **Date: 2024-08-12**\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis proposal suggests increasing the informal supply cap restriction previously set by the community in the past vote [[Temp Check] - Community Preference for Supply Cap Limits for LSTs](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba).\n\n## Motivation\n\nLST collateral and correlated asset borrowing with E-Mode is one of the primary use cases of Aave across networks. Previous discussions around supply cap methodologies resulted in the [TEMP CHECK] vote to limit the maximum supply cap of an LST to 75% of that LST’s circulating supply. \n\nIn the year and a half since that vote, Aave has continued to grow and new liquid restaking tokens (LRT) like weETH have shown strong demand as collateral in the protocol. LRTs have also seen strong proliferation to various chains with varying levels of the total supply spread across multiple L2s. \n\nAs a result, Aave is often the main location for storing LST and LRTs on any given chain and often represents an outsized share of the total supply on any given chain. \n\nIn this new environment, Aave has becomes the main location for LRT supply on chains like Scroll and Base, while also driving LST/LRT demand on chains like Polygon PoS. Simply put, when Aave increases LST supply caps, new supply comes to fill it.\n\nLST and LRT have also had longer time in the market, with clear support for peg and asset profiles developing. Aave’s use of oracles based on the LST redemption rate and implementation of CAPO have allowed for reduced risk from the secondary market volatility. \n\nThis calls for a new limit on a collateral’s supply limit as a percentage of the total supply. This proposal suggests raising the community preference supply cap limit to 90% of the total supply. \n\n## Specification\n\n- The community preference will update from 75% of total supply to 90% of total supply.\n- Risk Parameters will be updated by Risk Service Providers based on the results of this ARFC as needed.\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[[Temp Check] - Community Preference for Supply Cap Limits for LSTs](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xf9261916c696ce2d793af41b7fe556896ed1ff7a8330b7d0489d5567ebefe3ba)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated for the publication of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot passes, this community preference becomes canon and risk service providers incorporate this into current and future recommendations.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

Work with service providers and Etherfi to release and promote the new Aave V3 instance.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

        "body": "---\n\n### [TEMP CHECK] Deploy an Ethena Aave v3 Instance\n### Author: ACI\n###  Date: 2024-07-15\n\n---\n### Summary:\n\nThis proposal suggests deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on providing liquidity for sUSDe and USDe holders to borrow stablecoins.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEthena’s USDe stablecoin has grown to over $3b TVL with success as a supply and borrow asset on the mainnet Aave v3 instance. It has also seen large demand for use as collateral on other lending protocols.\n\nIn order to capitalize on this demand, we propose deploying a dedicated Aave v3 instance for Ethena’s stablecoins and related collateral assets. \n\nTo start the instance will use sUSDe and USDe as main collateral assets, with USDC, DAI and USDT as supply assets. \n\nWe also propose providing the Ethena instance with an initial GHO facilitator. \n\nThe goals for this instance will be to grow Aave market share for borrowers using sUSDe and USDe as well as create an additional steady revenue stream of GHO. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Ethena Aave v3 instance will implement the following:\n\n- The market will include sUSDe, USDe, USDC, DAI, USDT and a new GHO facilitator. Additional assets to consider during ARFC are Ethena’s Pendle PT tokens and rsUSDe.\n- This GHO facilitator will be limited in size to start both to limit risk to Ethena collateral and protect liquidity and the GHO peg.\n- The market will have stablecoin E-Mode to allow for high leverage borrowing between the correlated assets.\n- The market will use the existing sUSDe and USDe capped oracles, so that borrowers are not affected by fluctuations in the secondary market price.\n- Borrow parameters will match the mainnet Aave v3 instance, making it the most competitive location to borrow against sUSDe and USDe.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI has not been compensated by Ethena for the publication of this proposal.\n\nACI team members are holders of sUSDe, USDe and ENA.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before an ARFC snapshot.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot passes, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

The FRAX team has responded with major updates to security on sfrxETH in response to BGD Labs feedback. FRAX has also initated governance proposals to add GHO to Frax Lend. There are ongoing conversations to have a FRAX AMO included into Aave v3. sFRAX was [previously accepted](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-sfrax-on-ethereum-v3/16303) for onboarding in a previous [ARFC vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xdba99e9c8da24424447d7c7b70eff93ad5b6055714b5f34cf9859c923fb3a38a) before the introduction of CAPO feeds. \n\nThis proposal suggests finalizing the sFRAX onboarding by inviting risk service provider teams to provide CAPO recommendations. \n\nIn addition this proposal suggests removing FRAX from isolation mode to facilitate further AMO deployments. \n\n## Specification\n\n- sFRAX CAPO recommendations will be provided by risk service providers as part of this ARFC.\n- FRAX will be removed from isolation mode on Aave v3 instances.\n- FRAX will receive same parameters as DAI and a Reserve Factor of 15%\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers so ARFC has been updated accordingly.\n\n| MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY | ratioReferenceTime | maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7 Days | monthly | 50% |\n\n**sFRAX**\n\n| Parameter | Recommendation |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | NO |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | NO |\n| Stable Borrow | NO |\n| Enable Borrow | NO |\n| Enable Collateral | YES |\n| Loan To Value | 70.00% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 75.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 6.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 20.00% |\n| Supply Cap(sFRAX) | 10.00M |\n| Borrow Cap(sFRAX) | N/A |\n| Uoptimal | N/A |\n| Base | N/A |\n| Slope1 | N/A |\n| Slope2 | N/A |\n\n## **Useful Links**\n\n[[ARFC] Add FRAX on Ethereum v3 Forum Thread3](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-add-sfrax-on-ethereum-v3/16303/4)\n\n[[ARFC] Add FRAX on Ethereum v3 Forum Thread3 Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xdba99e9c8da24424447d7c7b70eff93ad5b6055714b5f34cf9859c923fb3a38a)\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
