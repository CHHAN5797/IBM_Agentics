The purpose of this AIP is to list BiLira (TRYB), the only and 1:1 Turkish Lira-backed stablecoin, on AAVE V3, Avalanche Network, Isolation Mode.\n\n### References:\n\nLink to:\n[Project](https://www.bilira.co/en/home).\n[Whitepaper](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5fb683a258cbdf70262c0b77/6023c066d244a79a1c000761_Whitepaper-(EN-1.0).pdf).\nToken Contracts: [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2c537e5624e4af88a7ae4060c022609376c8d0eb).[Avalanche](https://avascan.info/blockchain/c/address/0x564a341df6c126f90cf3ecb92120fd7190acb401).[Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4fb71290ac171e1d144f7221d882becac7196eb5).[Solana](https://explorer.solana.com/address/A94X2fRy3wydNShU4dRaDyap2UuoeWJGWyATtyp61WZf).[BNB](https://bscscan.com/address/0xC1fdbed7Dac39caE2CcC0748f7a80dC446F6a594).\n[Dune Analytics Dashboard](https://dune.com/memoshi/tryb-bilira).\n\n### Paragraph Summary:\nThe BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and is available on 6 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards. As emerging technologies continue to expand across the globe, the concept of open internet has allowed individuals all around the globe to instantly, securely and effortlessly share value and this created a need for non-USD stablecoins. We want to add TRYB to AAVE V3.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nBiLira offers every Turkish citizen a seamless connection to the decentralized internet. As emerging technologies continue to expand across the globe, the concept of the open internet - a fundamental network of information that is free and accessible to everyone regardless of financial motives - has allowed individuals all around the globe to instantly, securely, and effortlessly share information. The contributions to this advancement are immense and its impact is still unraveling around the world. \nToday, crypto assets and blockchain technology provide the means to transfer assets globally, securely, and at a low cost. Establishing an open internet based on value exchange can pave the way for a seamless, borderless and integrated world, which can eliminate barriers that enable the development of a global marketplace that is both economical and inclusive of everyone. \n\n\n### Specifications:\n\n### 1.What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nBiLira Team is the author of the AIP and the Asset.\n\n### 2.Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nThe BiLira (TRYB) token is a full-reserve stable cryptocurrency that is built on 6 different blockchains, issued and managed by the BiLira organization, backed by the Turkish Lira and collateralized 1 : 1, secure and compatible with ERC-20 token standards\nBiLira goes through regular audits performed by independent 3rd parties which can be found [here](https://www.bilira.co/en/audit-reports).\n\n### **BiLira (TRYB)**\n\nTRYB is a Turkish Lira backed stablecoin. BiLira aims to bridge the gap between web 2.0 (monetized by fiat) and web 3.0 (fueled by crypto assets), to offer a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance.  \nThe legacy financial system is dependent on private organizations and third-party services which makes it challenging for individuals to connect to the open internet and transact with one another. The current infrastructure does not support a transition from Web 2.0 banking system to the Web 3.0 crypto-based native web currencies. Since mainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are volatile, the public is looking for a better way that is more stable and safe to interact with digital assets and cryptocurrencies \n\n\nJust as information flows freely between web browsers, BiLira aims to make transferring value between wallets effortless, instant, and borderless for everyone.\n\n### 3.Explain positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nTRYB (BiLira) is a great fit both as a borrow and collateral asset for the Aave ecosystem. \nAAVE will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community by listing the reliable and only Turkish Lira backed stablecoin, TRYB (BiLira). Turkey was the world’s fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020 and became the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East in 2021. By enabling this user base to be able to use their currency as collateral, Aave will welcome a lot of new users to enter into DeFi.\nThere are also multiple institutional and retail players that want to borrow TRYB to market make in Turkish Lira denominated crypto markets.\n\n### 4.Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?) products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe stablecoin TRYB(BiLira) was released in early 2020.\nAs it is a 1:1 fiat backed stablecoin doesn’t have any pegging issues due to its nature.\n\n### 5.How is the asset currently used?\n\n###### Advanced fiat on/off-ramp:\nBiLira offers a convenient on-ramp and off-ramp solution for crypto traders to combat high price volatility and to support the future applications of decentralized finance. BiLira builds a fiat <> crypto on/off ramp for users to interact with global exchanges and DEXs as it is the only Turkish Lira backed stablecoin. \n\n###### Global coverage: \nIt will allow Turkish Users to participate on Aave with only a domestic bank transfer.  Aave will be onboarding a lot of new users from a very active Turkish crypto community. Turkey was the world’s fourth biggest cryptocurrency market in 2020 and became the largest cryptocurrency market in the Middle East in 2021. Turkey topped a million trades a day by the end of 2021. With over 40 exchanges operating in Turkey, the Middle East’s largest economy and home to around 85mn people, the adoption of cryptocurrencies is ever expanding. Turkish residents using cryptocurrencies were recorded at 16% to 20% between 2020 and 2022. Latest surveys show there are over 5 to 6 million Turkish people with cryptocurrency accounts. A cryptocurrency exchange in the country reported nearly 5 million users and had a trading volume of $203.5 million. \n\n###### Towards Decentralization:\nTurkish crypto users generally start their crypto journey through the local exchanges because they do not have to deal with the complexities of the blockchain technicalities, such as use of wallets and addresses. The BiLira team believes in the future of the Web3 decentralized ecosystem, where users control their assets via their own wallets, removing intermediaries and interacting with DeFi.\n\n### 6.Emission schedule\nBiLira is always fully collateralized and backed 1:1 by TRY fiat reserves.\n\n### 7.Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nTRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves, BiLira (1 TRYB) is always supported by one unit of the reserve currency (1 TRY). There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRYB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount of TRYB. \n\n-MasterMinter - adds and removes minters and increases their minting allowance (2 out of 3)\n-Minters - create and destroy tokens (2 out of 3)\n-Pauser - pause the contract, which prevents all transfers, minting, and burning (2 out of 3)\n-Blacklister - prevent all transfers to or from a particular address, and prevents that address from minting or burning (2 out of 3)\n-Owner - re-assign any of the roles except for admin (2 out of 3)\n-Admin - upgrade the contract, and re-assign itself (2 out of 3)\n \nThe signers of the Multisig are the cofounders of the BiLira Company\n \n### 8.Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nDaily trading volume, market capitalization, and other relevant analytics\n-Total Issuance: 3,782,105,670 TRY\n-Total Redemption: 3,642,521,623 TRY\n-TRYB AUM: 139,584,047 TRY\n-Fiat Reserves: 139,584,047 TRY\n-Total on-chain transfer volume:  30,002,670,196 TRYB\n-Listed on FTX, MEXC, Bitget, Bittrex, Liquid, Pangolin and DFX\n-Oracle data for TRYB is available on Chainlink\n\n### 9.Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/BiLira_Official).\n[Telegram](https://t.me/BiLira_Official).\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bilira/mycompany/).\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPNEFF7BjAcEd_JcwklbKQ).\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bilira_official/?hl=en).\n[News: Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bilira).\n[News: Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/search?query=tryb).\n[Conferences: Converge22](https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1549682084599455744).\n\n\nThe total size of the media community is over 50,000+ users across all social media platforms\n\n## Risk Parameters\n### V3 Isolation mode: \n-Loan-to-Value (LTV): 0%\n-Liquidation Threshold: 70% \n-Liquidation Bonus: 10% \n-Reserve Factor: 10%\n\n$10 Mil USD Debt Ceiling (Equivalent to 185 Mil TRY Debt Ceiling)\n\n### 10.

BiLira has been audited by the Central Bank of Turkey. Users need to go through the KYC and AML process.\n-There haven’t been any hacks or vulnerabilities on the project\n-The contract is verified on the explorers mentioned above in market statistics\n-The project can’t be considered a security as TRYB tokens are backed 1:1 with TRY fiat reserves, BiLira (1 TRYB) is always supported by one unit of the reserve currency (1 TRY). There is no risk for users when our customers withdraw TRYB to Turkish Lira we burn that amount of TRYB.\n\n### Voting Options\nYES - add TRYB on Aave V3\nNO - do not add TRYB on Aave V3\n",

RSR is the governance token for the Reserve Protocol and both (a) insures and (b) governs the stablecoins created and supported on the Reserve Protocol.\n\n# Motivation\nThe Reserve team is launching the Reserve protocol in fall of 2022. From that point on, the Reserve Rights (RSR) token will serve the purpose of (a) insuring and (b) governing stablecoins created on the Reserve protocol (RTokens).\n\nThe Reserve protocol [GitHub - reserve-protocol/protocol](https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/) is building on Aave by (a) integrating aTokens as collateral and (b) using the protocol oracle to determine price during valuation and auction functions (if listed on Aave as borrowable asset).\n\nWe would prefer to use the Aave oracles for the simplicity of our protocol’s design and the code has already been included in our ongoing audit. To do so, this requires RSR to be a borrowable asset on Aave.\n\nWhen RSR is staked on a particular Reserve stablecoin (RToken), it may receive a portion of income from the respective RToken’s full collateral basket. Because of this, we anticipate demand to borrow RSR in order to stake or hedge staked positions. Aave would be the only platform where this would be possible as of now.\n\n# Specifications\n## Link between the author & the project: \nThe Reserve team\n## High level overview of the project: \nThe mission of the Reserve project is to help people cope with the effects of high- or hyperinflation and aims to eventually eradicate it. The project does this by developing (a) stable+(**) cryptocurrencies, (b) a mobile application to exchange local currencies with the stable+ cryptocurrencies and (c) a protocol that insures & governs them.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaxl7iig3h3eceftb6qulbqugv52vmwndiv6da44y7zb6lrre6ole)\nThe Reserve app is currently available in Latin American countries where hyperinflation has had the most significant impact: Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia & Panama. It currently has >600,000 registered users and ~120,000 weekly app visitors who use the Reserve stablecoin(s) for daily purchases such as paying for groceries, paying bills, etc. This video shows how some of our customers use our stablecoin daily (https://tinyurl.com/mudrhh4d).\n\nThe Reserve Rights (RSR) token is the governance token used to insure the stable+ cryptocurrencies against collateral defaults, and while staked, is also used to govern the RTokens (collateral changes, etc).\n\nA key point is that when RSR is staked on a particular RToken, it will typically (% determined by governance) receive a portion of the income of the entire RToken’s collateral.\n\n(**) We define an asset as stable+ if it never depreciates, and generally appreciates over time, relative to its backing asset(s).\n\n## Why would RSR be a good borrow asset?\nWe anticipate that the yield on stRSR will drive demand to borrow RSR for two primary purposes: (a) to hedge against price changes on an existing stRSR position and (b) to borrow with intent to stake for the stRSR yield.\n\nThese are both well known strategies in DeFi and TradFi, and we don’t expect that to be any different with RSR. Furthermore, we have received a significant amount of requests from our community, but have delayed on making this request until we were closer to launching our platform.\n\nAave would be the first and currently, only, place to borrow RSR in DeFi and as a result, we anticipate there to be demand.\n\nBy listing RSR as a borrowable asset, Aave would become the first DeFi protocol that allows borrowing RSR and could therefore benefit from the borrowing demand from the RSR community and potentially other parties.\n\n## Brief history of the project’s components\nThe main relevant components of the Reserve ecosystem are the Reserve mobile app and the Reserve Protocol.\n\nThe Reserve app has been fully open access to users in the aforementioned countries since September 2021. The full version of the Reserve protocol will be live sometime in 2022. We anticipate this happening in the early Fall, although as with all development work, this could be a bit sooner or later.\n\nAn initial concept of fully collateralized stablecoins was launched in 2019, and since then the team has been working on the fully decentralized and permissionless platform that will allow for the creation of fully collateralized, yield bearing, and insured stablecoins. Full details on this updated version can be found here: [Protocol description - Reserve](https://reserve.org/protocol/2021_version/).\n\n## How is the asset currently used?\nAt this point in time the Reserve Rights (RSR) token serves as a placeholder token. From this year onward, the token will be used for two main purposes:\n1. RSR holders can stake their RSR on any Reserve stablecoin (RToken) to insure it against default of one of the collateral tokens and in return, may receive a portion of the yield generated by the collateral backing RTokens.\n2. RSR holders can govern Reserve stablecoin to help decide on its future (e.g. collateral assets, back-up assets, locking periods, etc).\n## Emission schedule\nThe total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, out of which there are currently 18.3b in circulation. The remaining 81.7b RSR tokens are locked. Out of these, 49.4b tokens belong to the Slow Wallet, 15.5b to seed investors and strategic partners and 16.8b to team members and advisors.\n\nThe [Slow Wallet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70?a=0x6bab6EB87Aa5a1e4A8310C73bDAAA8A5dAAd81C1) is a locked wallet controlled by the Reserve project, used to fund RToken adoption initiatives like listings, partnerships, marketing, etc. It’s under the discretionary control of the Reserve team. However, it has a hard-coded 4-week delay after initiating each withdrawal transaction on the blockchain. Upon initiating a withdrawal transaction, the team announces the purpose of the withdrawal either through a public on-chain message or on social media. If RSR holders do not agree with the purpose of the withdrawal, they are able to sell their RSR in the 4-week period before the project is able to sell what they have withdrawn. The team can only access these withdrawn tokens after those 4 weeks.\n\nMore details here: [Release schedule](https://reserve.org/protocol/rsr_release_schedule/#main-content)\n\n## Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\nThe total supply of RSR cannot be changed. RSR did migrate from a V1 contract in the past, and some RSR has not completed the migration yet. The only minting that occurs is from migration (which does not impact total supply).\n\nThe contract is un-upgradeable, however it is pausable. The pauser is set to the [Reserve team multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xA7b123D54BcEc14b4206dAb796982a6d5aaA6770/home), a 3-of-5 safe. Pausing will only be done in situations where the token or platform is in danger. Once the platform has reached steady state, the team intends to release pausing to a burn address.\n\n## Market data:\n- Market cap: ~$135,661,594\n- 24h volume: ~$41,000,000 (6mo daily avg)\n- Exchanges: Binance, Huobi Global, Crypto.com, OKX, FTX, Kucoin, Bithumb, Gate, Uniswap, IDEX ([and many more](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/reserve-rights/markets/))\n- Social channels data:\n     - English Twitter: ~101K followers\n     - Spanish Twitter: ~68K followers\n     - Spanish TikTok: ~168K followers\n     - Spanish Instagram: ~67K followers\n## Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\nImportant to note here is that Reserve only recently switched to a new RSR contract in order to prepare for the Reserve Protocol on Ethereum mainnet launch.

CVX is the governance token of the Convex Finance protocol.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCVX is not currently listed on major lending markets, including CVX on the platform would allow Aave to benefit from the first mover advantage. This has the potential to be a meaningful high vol asset revenue source. CRV is currently the fifth highest earn asset on the Aave V2 Market and has generated 190.33k aCRV tokens in revenue worth around $578.04k at the time of writing.\n\nIn addition to the lending and borrowing demand, the aCVX revenue can be used to support directing CRV and CVX incentives distribution to those who stake Curve Liquidity Provider tokens on Convex Finance. Further details can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n##  Specification\n\n**1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?**\n\nLlama Community has presented a proposal to deposit Aave community funds into Curve and Convex Finance. Listing CVX on Aave enables Aave to earn aCVX tokens which can then be used to support the treasury management proposal detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-consolidate-aave-v1-v2-amm-reserve-factors-purchase-cvx-and-deploy-to-earn-yield/6797).\n\n**2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token?**\n\nConvex allows Curve.fi liquidity providers to earn trading fees, CVX liquidity mining and boosted $CRV rewards without having to lock and use their boosting power with veCRV.. Adding support for $CVX will in turn provide future opportunities as Convex will also support other protocols in time. ie: FXS\n\nCVX is the governance token of the Convex protocol. By locking $CRV for life on Convex, each user gives his veCRV voting power to vlCVX holders (CVX lockers). Every vlCVX holders can vote on Convex governance proposals but also Curve governance proposals and gauges weights (5.05 veCRV/vlCVX). In the future, each vlCVX holders will control voting power on other tokens like FXS (users already can lock for life FXS for cvxFXS but vlCVX holders cannot vote on Frax governance proposals and gauges weights).\n\n**3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?**\n\nCVX would make an excellent fit for collateral in the Aave ecosystem. Adding CVX creates another use case outside of the Convex tokenomics model. Llama expects the CVX demand to be similar to CRV. Additionally:\n\n* Significant Borrow Demand: Users can borrow CVX and then either stake or lock the CVX token to earn yield. In addition to direct yield, investors may borrow CVX to lock and then influence how the inflation schedule of CRV and CVX is distributed. CRV has one of the highest utilisations and dollar value borrowed of all high volatility assets listed on Aave V2.\n* CVX holders can deposit (lend) CVX and then borrow stablecoins for farming, going leveraged long/short, and implementing structured products (e.g. carry trade).\n\nLlama Community intends to use the aCVX revenue generated to support Treasury Management activities. In this instance, aCVX could be redeemed and locked on Convex to then influence how the CRV and CVX inflation schedule is distributed. Llama Community intends to use the CVX to support growing the Aave and sAave Curve liquidity pools.\n\nThere is $43.2M TVL on the sAAVE pool and $11.8M TVL on the AAVE pool on Convex.\n\nThe Convex community is looking forward to lending and borrowing CVX on Aave. The community will enjoy extra revenues from the reserve factor.\n\n**4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?**\n\nConvex, as DeFi farmers themselves, the team needed a platform that allowed users to receive the max boost possible from CRV in a simplified manner and allow users to collect their actual rewards directly without auto-selling. They also believe CRV stakers should be rewarded more as they are effectively, mining together with Liquidity Providers. They intend to change that with Convex by charging a lower performance fee, returning fees back to the CRV stakers and CVX token holders, and distributing rewards directly.\n\nThe concept of Convex was published to the public on April 15, 2021 with the protocol launching on May 17, 2021.\n\n30th April 2021 - [Convex platform was whitelisted on the Curve platform](https://gov.curve.fi/t/cip-57-whitelist-the-convex-protocol/1654%20and%20Vote%20results:%20https://dao.curve.fi/vote/ownership/44)\n17th May 2022 - [Convex was released](https://convexfinance.medium.com/ready-set-go-69bd68019c5a)\n7th September 2021 - [CVX vote locking went live](https://convexfinance.medium.com/september-update-vote-locking-launch-liquidity-provider-incentives-and-more-1380f406f725)\n\n**5. How is the asset currently used?**\n\nThe CVX token governs over 559M$ worth of CRV locked in the protocol (and $4M worth of CVX in the Convex treasury multisig). CVX is currently only available on 2 Fuse pools, however there is no liquidity there.\n\n**6. Emission schedule**\n\nThe emission schedule can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/general-information/tokenomics).\n\n**7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?**\n\nConvex multisig can be found [here](https://docs.convexfinance.com/convexfinance/faq/multisig-admin-rights).\n\n**8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)**\n\n* Market capitalisation: $1.35B\n* Average daily volume on the 30 last days: $25,918,420.66\n* CVX is listed on many exchanges, the largest being Gate.io, Sushiswap, Uniswap and Binance Source: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/convex-finance#markets](http://www.coingecko.com)\n* veCRV controlled /vlCVX: 5.05 veCRV/vlCVX\n\n**9.

        "body": "# Summary\n1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.\n\n# Motivations\nLaunched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):\n\nTotal trading volume: $160B\nTotal swaps: 5.91M\nTotal users: 1.25M\n\n1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.\n\nThe mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.\n\nIn December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.\n\n# Benefits to Aave Community\n\n1INCH is highly liquid.\n1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.\n1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.\n\n# Resources\nWebsite: 1inch.io\nToken: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302 4\nGovernance Forum\nDiscord Chat\nGithub\nDocumentation\nBlog\nTwitter\nCoingecko\nDune analytics\n\n# Specification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\nRoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.\n\n1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.\n\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.\n\nOn the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\n1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.\n\n1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.\n\n1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.\n\nP2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.\n1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.\n\nSupported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.\n\n# How is the asset currently used?\n\n1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3\n\n#Emission schedule\n\nThe 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.\n\nOf the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).\n\nUncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).\n\n# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nThe smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.\n\nThe 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.\n\n# Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $548M circulating, $1.98B FDV\n24h Volume: $50M\nExchanges: CoinGecko | CoinMarketCap\nDEX:\nUniswap V3 1 | $9.9M TVL | $176k 24h Trading Volume\n1inch Liquidity Protocol | $3.4M TVL\nUniswap V2 | $0.5M TVL\n\n# Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nTwitter 2: 1.0M\nDiscord: 15.8k\nTelegram [EN]: 25.9k\nReddit: 7.9k\nGithub\n\n# Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment (Token): Dec-23-2020\nNumber of Transactions: 580k+\nNumber of Holders: 87k\n\n# Risk Factors\n# 1INCH - Risk Assessment\n\n## Smart Contract Risk Counterparty Risk Market Risk Overall Risk\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-04 at 19.47.49.png](ipfs://bafkreie6zbinxzt2fufyo76ha7tb7mbbjwir2mgougsnbgqjg2x7ymiobm)\n    \n\n## General\n\nThe 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.\n\n* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.\n* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.\n* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.\n  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.\n  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.\n  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.\n\nThe 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nDAO Treasury: 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07\n1inch Foundation: 0x5E89f8d81C74E311458277EA1Be3d3247c7cd7D1\n1INCH: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302\nst1INCH: 0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba\nv1INCH: 0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2\nChainlink Oracle: 0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8\n\n## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:\n\nThe 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M\n\nThe 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.\n\nThe 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.\n\nOn April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.\n\nThere is an extensive list of audits available on Github.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nAudits: https://github.com/1inch/1inch-v2-audits\n1inch Genesis: 0x9825b9f083ba43112afd66dbcfbbf770e24bc21ff4128ce24ddbda171d79ae2f\nBurn 1INCH Key Transaction: 0x8799998e32cf58f4939a1fb21b3e679f1cc4598b26b73bfea6f265fa5426d511\n\n## 1INCH Counterparty Risk:\n\n1inch is a permissionless protocol where 1INCH holders do not have a say in how the protocol or DAO is governed.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program.\n\nThe st1INCH token is used for governing the DAO and although there is no revenue sharing like with xSUSHI there are economic rewards/incentives for those who hold the token. st1INCH token holders receive up to 100% of gas expenses refunded, depending on your stake size. Under this program, 1INCH tokens are distributed as a gas refund to Ethereum users who stake 1INCH tokens through the 1INCH dApp. Borrowing 1INCH with the intent to receive a gas refund is a useful utility.\n\nUsers who stake 1INCH receive st1INCH which is non transferrable and used for governance. If a malicious actor was to borrow 1INCH, stake to receive st1INCH and then try attack the DAO’s treasury, then the Treasury Multisig 7 of 12 can veto the proposal during the 72 hour timelock period post successful Snapshot vote. This measure provides a level of protection for the DAO’s Treasury funds which are nominated in USDC. Any malicious attack on the DAO Treasury would not lead to the actor selling 1INCH on-market and this scenario would not create bad debt by moving the spot price of 1INCH.\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n\nRisk parameters can be found on the forum thread linked below.

        "body": "# Summary\n1inch is a network of decentralized protocols designed to provide the fastest and most efficient operations in the DeFi space. 1inch Network was launched in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard the 1inch Network token (1INCH) as a collateral asset in Aave.\n\n# Motivations\nLaunched in 2019, and with over 60% of the market share 1, the 1inch Aggregation Protocol is both the oldest and most trusted DEX aggregator in the DeFi space. The 1inch Network’s metrics are below (source 1):\n\nTotal trading volume: $160B\nTotal swaps: 5.91M\nTotal users: 1.25M\n\n1INCH token is the governance and utility token for the 1inch Network. 1INCH has a circulating market cap of $500M 1, a daily trading volume of $50M+, and is currently listed on highly liquid centralized exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, FTX, Gemini, and Kraken. In addition to the spot markets, 1INCH also has perpetual markets on the centralized Binance and FTX exchanges, as well as the decentralized dYdX exchange.\n\nThe mint function for 1INCH was recently burned 4 by the 1inch Foundation – the future supply of 1INCH will not exceed the 1.5 billion amount described in the original distribution schedule 4.\n\nIn December of 2021, 1inch Labs completed a $175M funding round 2 for 1inch Network Pro development. This was done via a direct token sale to accredited and institutional investors.\n\n# Benefits to Aave Community\n\n1INCH is highly liquid.\n1INCH is not yet listed on any decentralized lending platforms, so Aave will have a first-mover advantage.\n1INCH is listed on several perpetual markets – there are robust centralized and decentralized price oracles for 1INCH.\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds.\n\n# Resources\nWebsite: 1inch.io\nToken: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302 4\nGovernance Forum\nDiscord Chat\nGithub\nDocumentation\nBlog\nTwitter\nCoingecko\nDune analytics\n\n# Specification\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\nRoundElephant is a community and governance Core Contributor for the 1inch Network.\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n1inch Network is a decentralized set of protocols that aim to improve the efficiency of the DeFi space. The 1INCH token is used to govern the protocols and is also in control of the protocols’ revenue stream. 1INCH has the added utility of providing stakers with subsidized transactions via the gas refund program. 3\n\n3. Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n1INCH governs the largest aggregation protocol in the EVM space.\n\n1INCH is highly liquid in the spot market and has perpetual markets on Binance, FTX, and a decentralized perpetual market on dYdX.\n\n1INCH has a wide set of token holders ranging from early adopters, who were airdropped the token for free back in December 2020, to accredited and institutional investors, who bought the token in the subsequent funding rounds. Currently, none of these holders have a way of tapping into their equity without selling.\n\nOn the demand side, users can borrow 1INCH to participate in the gas refund program, or support specific governance proposals.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nThe 1inch Network was founded by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov over the course of the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its Aggregation Protocol V1. Since then, 1inch Network has developed additional DeFi tools such as the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P transactions, and 1inch Mobile Wallet.\n\n1inch Aggregation Protocol: The 1inch API v4, Pathfinder, is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm, which offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Pathfinder finds the most efficient paths for a token swap, able to split between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.\n\n1inch Liquidity Protocol: 1inch Liquidity protocol (previously called Mooniswap) is an AMM that aims to offer capital-efficient liquidity positions while protecting users from front-running.\n\n1inch Limit Order Protocol: 1inch limit order protocol is a set of smart contracts that allows users to place limit orders, and RFQ Orders, which later can be filled on-chain. Both types of orders are a data structure created off-chain and signed according to EIP-712. Key features of the protocol are extreme flexibility and high gas efficiency.\n\nP2P Transactions: 1inch Peer-to-Peer allows two users to make an over-the-counter style trade of any ERC20 token.\n1inch Mobile Wallet: The 1inch Mobile Wallet is a fast and secure crypto wallet with a built-in DEX aggregator and an easy interface for secure storage and transactions.\n\nSupported Networks: 1inch protocols are deployed on the following EVM networks: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis chain, Avalanche, and Fantom.\n\n# How is the asset currently used?\n\n1INCH is currently used as a governance and utility tool for the 1inch Network. Since November 2021, all revenue collected from the 1inch Aggregation protocol is sent to the 1inch DAO Treasury 1. The 1inch DAO has full control over the treasury and the 1INCH token is used to govern the decisions made by the DAO.\n\nHolders of the 1inch Network token may stake it in the 1inch DAO governance contract and participate in general proposals, Instant Governance, or benefit from the gas refund program. 3\n\n#Emission schedule\n\nThe 1INCH distribution and token unlock schedule can be seen here 4.\n\nOf the 1.5B total future supply, 415M 1INCH are currently in circulation. The remaining tokens will be gradually unlocked until December 2024 (when the maximum supply of 1.5B is reached).\n\nUncirculated 1INCH is held in on-chain vesting contracts. v1INCH is the non-transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens currently locked in the vesting contract. There are 1.07B v1INCH (these are included in the 1.5B total future supply).\n\n# Token & protocol permissions and upgradability\n\nThe smart contracts of 1inch Network are immutable and cannot be upgraded – new versions of protocols require the deployment of new contracts. Specific protocol parameters can be dynamically changed by DAO participants via Instant Governance.\n\nThe 1INCH token is non-upgradable. The token’s mint function, previously controlled by a mutli-sig, was recently burned 4 – there will never be more than 1.5B 1INCH.\n\n# Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket Cap: $548M circulating, $1.98B FDV\n24h Volume: $50M\nExchanges: CoinGecko | CoinMarketCap\nDEX:\nUniswap V3 1 | $9.9M TVL | $176k 24h Trading Volume\n1inch Liquidity Protocol | $3.4M TVL\nUniswap V2 | $0.5M TVL\n\n# Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nTwitter 2: 1.0M\nDiscord: 15.8k\nTelegram [EN]: 25.9k\nReddit: 7.9k\nGithub\n\n# Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment (Token): Dec-23-2020\nNumber of Transactions: 580k+\nNumber of Holders: 87k\n\n# Risk Factors\n# 1INCH - Risk Assessment\n\n## Smart Contract Risk Counterparty Risk Market Risk Overall Risk\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-04 at 19.47.49.png](ipfs://bafkreie6zbinxzt2fufyo76ha7tb7mbbjwir2mgougsnbgqjg2x7ymiobm)\n    \n\n## General\n\nThe 1inch Network was launched at the ETHGlobal New York hackathon in May 2019 with the release of its aggregation protocol v1. Since then, the 1inch Network has also launched the Liquidity Protocol, Limit Order Protocol, P2P Transactions and 1inch Mobile Wallet. The 1inch Network is composed of three independent entities, the 1inch Foundation, 1inch Core Contributors and 1inch DAO that each operate separately.\n\n* 1inch Foundation is a non profit organisation with the goal of fostering 1inch Network growth and support initiatives that benefit the 1inch community. The foundation issued the 1inch token, however the 1inch DAO has control over the smart contract. The 1inch Foundation holds around 28,188,355.56 1INCH tokens via a 2 of 3 multisig.\n* Core Contributors are a decentralised group of 1inch Network technical contributors dedicated to building out the 1inch Network. The largest contributor of the Core Contributors is 1inch labs.\n* 1inch DAO governs the 1inch Network through a set of on-chain smart contracts. The 1inch DAO has control, amongst others, over the 1INCH token, DAO Treasury, 1inch Network Protocols and the revenue streams generated by those protocols. Do note the 1inch Treasury only holds USDC at the time of writing.\n  * 1INCH: The un-staked version of 1INCH does not have the ability to vote on governance proposals.\n  * st1INCH: A non transferable ERC-20 which represents 1INCH staked within the 1inch protocol’s governance contract. This has a Voting Weight of 100%. There is no time commitment or waiting period upon entering or exiting the contract respectively.\n  * v1INCH: This is an ERC-20 which represents 1INCH tokens that are currently locked in the vesting contract. These tokens are held by backers, advisors and core contributors but are not yet fully-vested. Each v1INCH has 1/5th (20%) the Voting Weight compared to st1INCH.\n\nThe 1inch DAO earns its revenue in the form of USDC via the Swap Surplus collector which deposits the funds in the DAO’s treasury. A Swap Surplus occurs when a User performs a swap and the price terms change between when the swap was quoted and when the transaction was mined on the network. The majority of the Swap Surplus is swapped for USDC and sent directly to the 1inch Network DAO Treasury.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nDAO Treasury: 0x7951c7ef839e26F63DA87a42C9a87986507f1c07\n1inch Foundation: 0x5E89f8d81C74E311458277EA1Be3d3247c7cd7D1\n1INCH: 0x111111111117dc0aa78b770fa6a738034120c302\nst1INCH: 0xA0446D8804611944F1B527eCD37d7dcbE442caba\nv1INCH: 0x03d1b1a56708fa298198dd5e23651a29b76a16d2\nChainlink Oracle: 0x72AFAECF99C9d9C8215fF44C77B94B99C28741e8\n\n## 1INCH Smart Contract Risk:\n\nThe 1INCH token was launched on 23rd December 2020. Since then it has done over $250B in trading volume with the number of Users approaching 3M\n\nThe 1INCH token is an ERC-20 token with no governance influence held by around 88,475 wallets and the staked INCH token, st1INCH, used for governance is held by around 5,391 wallets. The staking contract holds 20,218,800.81 INCH tokens at the time of writing.\n\nThe 1inch Foundation, although a 2 of 3 multisig has transferred out the vast majority of 1INCH token from the wallet. The current value of the 1inch Foundation wallet is approximately $15M and all 3 signers are on at least one other wallet which is also 2 of 3 which holds a similar value.\n\nOn April 6th, 2022 the 1inch Foundation burned the mint function of 1INCH.\n\nThere is an extensive list of audits available on Github.\n\nRelevant addresses are linked below:\n\nAudits: https://github.com/1inch/1inch-v2-audits\n1inch Genesis: 0x9825b9f083ba43112afd66dbcfbbf770e24bc21ff4128ce24ddbda171d79ae2f\nBurn 1INCH Key Transaction: 0x8799998e32cf58f4939a1fb21b3e679f1cc4598b26b73bfea6f265fa5426d511\n\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\nPlease see the discussion on the governance forum, linked below, for full context on the associated risks for listing 1INCH.  Due to the character limitation of snapshot, a summary of Gauntlet's risk parameters for listing the asset as collaerla on Aave v2 is shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Vaue|\n| --- | --- |\n|Collateral|Yes|\n|Borrowing|Yes|\n|LTV|40%|\n|Liquidation Threshold|50%|\n|Liquidation Penalty|8.5%|\n|Reserve Factor|20%|\n|UOptimal|45%|\n|R_0|0%|\n|R_s1|7%|\n|R_s2|300|",
