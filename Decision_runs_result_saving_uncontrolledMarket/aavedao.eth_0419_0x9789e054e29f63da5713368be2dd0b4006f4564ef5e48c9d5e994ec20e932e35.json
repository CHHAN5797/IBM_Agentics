        "body": "---\ntitle: [ARFC] Further increase GHO Borrow Rate\nauthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative\ncreated: 2023-10-05\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes a further increase in the GHO borrow rate by 50 basis points (bps), raising it from 2.5% to 3%.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave community has previously recognized the importance of adjusting the GHO borrow rate to maintain the stability and health of the protocol. The motivations for this proposal are:\n\n1. **Strengthening the GHO Peg**: The prior adjustment to the GHO borrow rate resulted in a stronger GHO peg. An additional increase is anticipated to further bolster the peg and get closer to the target value.\n2. **Enhancing GHO Revenue**: By increasing the borrow rate, the protocol is expected to generate additional revenue from GHO borrowings.\n3. **Coordinated Effort**: This proposal aligns with other initiatives, including the GHO buy program set of AIPs, as part of a coordinated effort to support the GHO peg.\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\n\nThis proposal also greenlights the ACI for a `direct-to-AIP` process for 50 bps increments every 30 days, as long as the GHO peg is outside 0,995<>1,005 monthly average price range, up to 5.5% borrow rate. \n\n## Specification\n\n- Asset: GHO  \n- Contract Address: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f  \n- Current Borrow Rate: 2.5%  \n- Proposed Borrow Rate: 3%  \n- New discounted Borrow Rate: ~2.1%\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

        "body": "## Title: [ARFC] Increase GHO Borrow Rate\n## Author: Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative\n## Date: 2023-08-23\n---\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThis ARFC proposes an increase in the borrow rate of GHO from the current rate of 1.5% to 2.5%. The aim is to address the peg deviation of GHO and ensure its growth and trustworthiness in the market.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nGHO has witnessed a rapid growth, reaching a circulating supply of 22M in just a few weeks since its launch. One of the primary reasons for this growth, especially in the current adverse market conditions, is the GHO borrow rate set below the market price of stablecoin borrows. This low rate, combined with the current lack of holding venues and the inability to use GHO as collateral, has made single-side liquidity provision in stableswaps, such as Balancer pools, [one of the most sought-after strategies.](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity)\n\nWhile deep liquidity and growth are desired as a go-to-market strategy for GHO, the peg deviation of GHO (currently around $0.975) is affecting its growth and trust in the market. A consensus short-term solution to this issue is to slightly raise the GHO borrow rate from 1.5% to 2.5%. This rate remains attractive for borrowers and is still below the market average rates. However, by reducing the discount, it is anticipated to have a positive effect.\n\nThis proposal is particularly relevant in the context of the potential [sDAI onboarding integration](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-sdai-aave-v3-onboarding/14410). This integration is expected to add short-term sell pressure on GHO, especially with the current borrow rate, which could further harm the GHO peg.\n\nThe discount for stkAave holders remains unchanged at 30%.\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Asset**: GHO\n- **Contract Address**: 0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f\n- **Current Borrow Rate**: 1.5%\n- **Proposed Borrow Rate**: 2.5%\n- **New discounted Borrow Rate**: ~1.75%\n\n## Disclamer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback on this ARFC.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, implement the proposed changes to the GHO borrow rate.\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

User's funds are not at risk of liquidation and the borrowing rate remains unchanged. \n\nBy progressively increasing the reserve factors, the interest rate for supplying these assets on v2 will be increasingly less attractive, thus encouraging suppliers to transition positions to v3.\n\nOf the assets that are currently frozen, with the exception of BAL, the RF is to be increaed to 99.99%. Around $680k of users positions, CRV, DPI, GHST and LINK will receive near zero deposit yield. This represents less than 0.5% of Aave v2's TVL. The highest deposit yield of these assets at the time of writing is 0.21%. This change will have minimal affect. \n\nThe remaining assets are to receive an incremental 5% increase in the RF. After implementing this publication, user elasticity shall be assessed and the impact of the updates before moving forward with additional increases. \n\nThere shall be a minimum gap of 2 weeks between each subsequent update. Target AIP submission date is week commencing 31st July, ain 3 weeks time.  \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated:\n\n|Asset|Current RF |Proposed RF |\n|---|---|---|\n|DAI|21.00%|26.00%|\n|USDC|23.00%|28.00%|\n|USDT|22.00%|27.00%|\n|wBTC|55.00%|60.00%|\n|wETH|45.00%|50.00%|\n|MATIC|41.00%|46.00%|\n|BAL|32.00%|37.00%|\n|CRV|38.00%|99.99%|\n|GHST|60.00%|99.99%|\n|LINK|50.00%|99.99%|\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Following community feedback, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\n2) If consensus is reached, submit the first Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP) to implement the proposed updates.\n3) Subsequent increments will be done directly through an AIP to reduce the governance overhead.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe author, TokenLogic, receives payment indirectly from [Aave Grant DAO](https://twitter.com/AaveGrants) via [Butter](https://twitter.com/butterymoney) as part of the [Incentivised Delegate Campaign](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-incentivized-delegate-campaign-3-month/11732).

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Treasury Management - Amend Safety Module AAVE Emissions\nAuthor: @MarcZeller - Aave Chan Initiative & @TokenLogic\nDate: 2023-09-24\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis publication proposes reducing AAVE (Safety Incentives) distributions to the Safety Module (SM) by 30% and introducing a 90-day SM emission cycle.\n\n## Motivation\nThe SM serves as the Aave Protocol’s self-protection smart contract. The Aave Protocol distributes 1,100 AAVE daily, split evenly across AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH deposits.\n\nFuture proposals shall discuss the composition and aim to improve the overall capital efficiency of the SM. However, this publication intends to reduce AAVE emissions in the immediate future, saving the DAO valuable AAVE emissions while the broader SM upgrade is being advanced. It is widely accepted within the community that Aave DAO is overpaying for AAVE and B-80BAL-20wETH deposits.\n\nThis publication proposes reducing AAVE emissions by ~30%. The revised AAVE emission is to be reduced from 1,100 AAVE/day to 770 AAVE/day. This represents a 330 AAVE/day reduction. The APR for stkAAVE holders is expected to reduce from 6.87% to 4.81%. Similarly, for the B-80BAL-20wETH deposits, yield is expected to fall from 14.35% to 10.05%.\n\nPlease note that the 80AAVE/20wETH Balancer v1 pool is to be migrated to Balancer v2 in the future. This will present the community with an opportunity to further revise the AAVE emissions. It may also occur at a time when the DAO has vlAURA and/or veBAL at its disposal.\n\nFor context, the Llama Part IV SM Upgrade suggests reducing the AAVE emission to stkAAVE holders by 75%. This is because slashing for stkAAVE is to be reduced, additional assets are to be added to the SM, and the emissions are to be redirected to those newly added assets. Since this proposal was published, stkAAVE has also gained the utility of discounted GHO borrowing rates.\n\nSimilarly, Xenophon Labs recommended doubling the slashing percentage from 30% to 60% on the stkAAVE pool and lowering emissions by 80 AAVE/day, from 550 to 470. While this publication does not propose amending the slashing rate, the reduction in AAVE emissions is about double.\n\n## Specification\nThe implementation for this proposal will be prepared by ACI. The table below shows the current and proposed daily AAVE Emissions.\n\n| Collateral           | Current Emissions | Proposed Emissions |\n|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| AAVE                 | 550               | 385                |\n| B-80AAVE-20wETH      | 550               | 385                |\n\nTransition to a 90-day period SM Emission schedule.\n\nA comparison between Xenophon Labs’ proposal and this proposal for stkAAVE holders is shown below:\n\n| TVL      | Slashing Rate | Protection | AAVE/day | AAVE Price | Annual Spend | Annual Cost per $ of Coverage | Deposit Yield |\n|----------|---------------|------------|----------|------------|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| $175.0M | 30%           | 52.5M      | 550      | $60.00     | $12.045M     | $0.23                         | 6.88%         |\n| $175.0M | 60%           | 105.0M     | 470      | $60.00     | $10.293M     | $0.10                         | 5.88%         |\n| $175.0M | 30%           | 52.5M      | 385      | $60.00     | $8.431M      | $0.16                         | 4.82%         |\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If the snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate the proposal to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclosure\nNeither ACI nor TokenLogic are compensated for the creation of this proposal by Aave Protocol.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Onboarding this asset into Aave will:\n\n- Reinforce synergies between Aave and Curve.\n- Offer Aave users an additional decentralized stablecoin option matching the ACI diversity support ethos.\n- Strengthen the relationship between the CRVUSD & the GHO stablecoins.\n\nAs the primary usecase for stablecoins is to be deposited by users looking for a passive yield and used as a borrowable asset and not as much as a collateral asset, the ACI proposes a CRVUSD onboarding outside isolation mode but without collateral properties.\n\nFollowing CrvUSD maturity, the Aave governance can propose a collateral activation for crvUSD at a later stage. \n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: CRVusd  \nContract address: [0xf939E0A03FB07F59A73314E73794Be0E57ac1b4E](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf939E0A03FB07F59A73314E73794Be0E57ac1b4E)  \nPrice Feed: [0xEEf0C605546958c1f899b6fB336C20671f9cD49F](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEEf0C605546958c1f899b6fB336C20671f9cD49F)\n\nWe propose the following parameters for a crvUSD onboarding:\n\n| Parameter                  | Value               |\n|----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Isolation Mode             | No                 |\n| Borrowable                 | Yes                 |\n| Borrowable in isolation    | Yes                 |\n| Stable Borrowing           | No                  |\n| Collateral Enabled         | No                 |\n| Supply Cap (CRVUSD)        | 60,000,000          |\n| Borrow Cap (CRVUSD)        | 50,000,000          |\n| Debt Ceiling               | N/A               |\n| LTV                        | N/A              |\n| LT                         | N/A             |\n| LB                         | N/A                  |\n| LPF                        | 10%                 |\n| Base rate                  | 0%                  |\n| Slope 1                    | 5%                  |\n| Slope 2                    | 80%                 |\n| Optimal ratio              | 80%                 |\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n2. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provided feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave-chan Initiative is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by Curve for creating this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
