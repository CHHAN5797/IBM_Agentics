A 5M GHO swap resulting in a low quoted price impact.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-25 at 16.31.13](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skw0hibAA.png)\n\nOverall, TVL is sitting around $45M with the amount of GHO allocated to DEXes being approximately 10M. These numbers don't account for GHO Stability Modules (GSM) totaling 16M across USDC and USDT. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 13.32.20](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJXwCYaTR.png)\n\nThe Tricrypto pool on Curve and 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool on Balancer have seen inflows in response coordinating liquidity and boosting rewards to those pools. By workingly closely with various fund managers, we have been able to achieve significant deposit growth over the last month. \n\nWith perp funding rates drifting lower, the cost of capital has also drifted lower from 17.5% to around 10-12%. In general, providing DEX liquidity has become more attraction from a capital allocation perspective. However, stkGHO remains the more attractive investment and we consistently receive this feedback from various fund managers across the industry.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 13.52.38](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkc7X56aA.png)\n\nOn Ethereum, the more battle tested pools like [Balancer's GHO/USDC/USDT 3pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x8353157092ed8be69a9df8f95af097bbf33cb2af0000000000000000000005d9) have had good success with attracting liquidity relative to the newer [ECLPs by Gyroscope](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/). On Arbitrum, with a more retail LP user base, the reverse appears to be true. \n\nMore generally, this is leading to a re-think of how we approach ECLPs in general with Maverick proving to be more effective and responsive as a peg defense tool on Ethereum with over 6M of liquidity.\n\nThe [Notional Finance](https://www.notional.finance/vaults/mainnet/0xeeb885af7c8075aa3b93e2f95e1c0bd51c758f91/CreateVaultPosition?borrowOption=0x00000000eeb885af7c8075aa3b93e2f95e1c0bd51c758f910003ffffffffff0a) integration provides a large portion of the 3pool liquidity on Balancer by offering users the ability to leverage farm the incentives to amplify the returns. Leveraging the BPT postion on Aura Finance, has proven an effective tool to help support the peg.\n\nThe below provides an overview of GHO's current liquidity incentive distribution on Ethereum:\n\n![Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 13.26.19](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1jepF6pA.png)\n\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nGHO's growth on Arbitrum has been slower than intended due to lack of volume through the bridge. \n\nThere is no native supply on Aave and transferring GHO to Arbitrum for yield is directly competing with stkGHO and liquidity provisioning on Ethereum. Borrowing GHO on Ethereum to provide liquidity on Arbitrum requires extra steps and generates similar returns. Of the GHO that was coordinated through the bridge, a large portion has been swapped out of DEX liquidity pools and now resides on Aave. The ability to arbitrum GHO's price between networks becomes more practical with growing supply on both networks.\n\nThe above has influenced in GHO consistently trading above $1.00, with a 5M swap resulting in a higher price impact (above 50%). The TVL in GHO pools in Arbitrum is $5.7M, with GHO representing about $1.2M.\n\n# Phase IV Lookahead\n\n## Ethereum\n\nIn the near future we expect GHO to be listed on InstadApp with several curated vaults providing additional utility and yield opportunites that use GHO.\n\nA sUSDS/GHO strategy vault is expected to launch on Contango with support from the Contango team. Early stage discussions with prospective investors is promising.\n\nWe also expect GHO to feature in the upcoming Royco launch with the intent to drive flows into several yield strategies across Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\nAchieving 50M of DEX liquidity on Ethereum across various integrations remains a key focus. Whilst we are yet to acheive this target, we are currently very well positioned for current market conditions. \n\nThe 80/20 wstETH/GHO pool on Balancer and GHO/wBTC/wstETH pool on Curve are to be consolidated into GHO/tBTC/wETH pool. This is expected to reduce cost and offer better swap routings.\n\nIn the near future, we expect further joint collaborations between Paxos, Balancer and the ALC resulting in a new liquidity pool and acheiving the 50M TVL target. Looking beyond this, there will be an increasing focus on integrations that create utility for GHO.\n\nWith GHO surpassing 150M circulating supply and approaching 50M in DEX liquidity, we expect potential opportunities for the ALC to support GHO listing on centralised exchanges. \n\nWhen accounting for the above, the proposed quarterly budget for the Ethereum ecosystem is 650,000 GHO.\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nTo boost GHO supply on Arbitrum, the September Finance update proposes transferring 5M GHO from the Treasury on Ethereum to Aave v3 on Arbitrum. This is substantially increase the GHO supply on the network.\n\nIn the near future, we expect GHO to be listed on Synthetixs v3 with under-utilised liquidity deposited into Aave v3 to earn yield.\n\nA USDe/aGHO ECLP is to launch soon with x30 Sats with support from the ALC. \n\nThe ALC's focus on Arbitrum is shifting towards creating utility and demand sinks for GHO as DEX liquidity is well positioned to support the peg. \n\nThe previous ARB budget for GHO liquidity on Arbitrum was 375,000 ARB over 3 months. This is equivalent to around $200,000 at spot prices. With the expected GHO listing on Synthetix in the near future, the overal Arbitrum budget is to replace existing liquidity spending and also focus on the broader adoption of GHO within the ecosystem.\n\nThe quarterly budget for the Arbitrum ecosystem is 300,000 GHO. \n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe below details some high-level GHO metrics:\n\n| Description | Ethereum Value | Arbitrum Value |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------:  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M | 30M |\n| TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)  | 15M  | 10M |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC) | < 0.10%  | < 0.25%  |\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for >90% time | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO) |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next three months. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\n# Specification\n\nCreate an Allowance for GHO on Ethereum for a total of 950,000 GHO.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: `0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP will implement this proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding Phase III  \nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic  \ncreated: 2024-06-11\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) with 600k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next three months on Ethereum.\n\nThe ALC will be funded by 375,000 ARB on Arbitrum from the LTIPP submission by the @ACI.\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs GHO continues to grow on Ethereum, there is an increasing need for deeper liquidity to facilitate greater swap sizes with minimal price impact. Providing a great UX for larger swaps is a prerequisite for enabling more sophisticated and larger DeFi users to transition into GHO.\n\nAs GHO expands to other networks, like Arbitrum with others to follow, the ALC aims to develop a liquidity strategy and drive efforts that create utility to support the adoption of GHO on each new deployment.\n\n## Ethereum\n\n### Phase II Update\n\nOver the last three months, the Aave Liquidity Committee has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes and coordinated several key initiatives, leading to improved swap conditions.\n\nSome of the notable achievements are mentioned below:\n\n* GHO trading at peg\n* Deeper on-chain DEX liquidity (Increase from 13M to over 32M)\n* Borrow Cap increased from 32M to 85M \n* Improved peg resilience\n* Both USDC and USDT GSMs are funded\n* Cowswap & Paraswap have integrated various GHO liquidity pool types\n* Cowswap has integrated both USDC and USDT GSMs\n\nIn combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC-led initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery. The peg has recovered, the two GSMs are funded, and there is now over 32M in DEX liquidity pools. The vast majority of the DEX liquidity is nominated in the non-GHO trading pair.\n\nMaverick has been a critical tool for helping recover the peg. As GHO appreciated, several Boosted Positions were deployed providing additional liquidity depth to prevent GHO from retracing. With the imminent launch of Maverick v2, new pools will be deployed and liquidity will be reconstructed to reflect recent trading history.\n\n### Phase III Lookahead\n\nAs GHO continues to grow, there is a genuine requirement for deeper liquidity to accommodate larger swaps on a more consistent basis. During Phase III, the ALC will focus on the following key areas:\n\n* Reduced price volatility\n* Deeper structured concentrated liquidity\n* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools\n\nWith several ongoing efforts to onboard larger GHO users, this creates a need to consistently accommodate increasingly larger swaps with minimal price impact. In the months ahead we expect several builders to transition to GHO.\n\nAchieving 50M of DEX liquidity across various integrations remains a key focus. Initiatives like adding the GHO/USDC ECLP to the Safety Module (SM) will help achieve this goal. Other efforts include increasing the amplification on the Balancer 3pool, which are also helping facilitate larger swaps. The anticipated Maverick airdrop is also expected to contribute towards growing liquidity by complementing GHO emissions.\n\nSupporting the growth of GHO utility in collaboration with Aave Grants DAO has resulted in several integrations. The ALC will continue to promote integrations and create utility supporting broader adoption.\n\nIn the near term, we expect broader market conditions to improve. This is likely to result in increased liquidity costs for sustaining existing LP deposits and also elevated costs for attracting new liquidity deposits. The ALC is receiving feedback from various fund managers of increasing hurdle rate expectations for new capital deployments. This can largely be attributed to opportunity costs and risk-adjusted returns from competing yield sources.\n\nThe proposed Ethereum budget for Phase III:\n\n| Objective | Previous Budget | Proposed Budget   |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------: |\n| Liquidity  + Utility | 500,000 GHO | 600,000 GHO |\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nWith the launch of GHO on Arbitrum being imminent, the ALC aims to design a liquidity strategy and support creating utility for GHO within the ecosystem. The initial strategy is likely to feature ECLPs on Balancer via Gyroscope, concentrated liquidity on Maverick v2 when deployed, and possibly other DEXes.\n\nA general update on GHO's liquidity launch is mentioned below:\n\n* GHO/(a)USDC ECLP - Included in the Arbitrum SM\n* GHO/USDe ECLP - Partnership with Ethena, Gyroscope, and Balancer\n* (d)GHO/GYD ECLP - Partnership with Gyroscope and possibly Gearbox\n* GHO/USDC/USDT - Balancer v2\n* GHO/USDC - Maverick v2 upon launch\n\nOther pools are being evaluated as we progressively work towards finalising the GHO launch liquidity plans.\n\nThe proposed Arbitrum budget for Phase III, which excludes SM Emission, is shown below:\n\n| Objective | Proposed Budget |\n| --------  | :--------:  |\n| Liquidity  + Utility (excl. SM) | 375,000 ARB |\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe below details some high-level GHO metrics we propose tracking:\n\n| Description | Ethereum Value | Arbitrum Value |\n| --------  | :--------:  | :--------:  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M | 30M |\n| TVL Utility Liquidity Pools (Excl. stkGHO)  | 15M  | 10M |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap (GHO to USDC) | < 0.10%  | < 0.25%  |\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for >90% time | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO) |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next three months. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\n# Specification\n\nOf the 2M GHO held by the ALC from AIP-115, 600,000 GHO shall be retained by the ALC and the remaining 1.4M transferred to the collector contract.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`  \nALC Arbitrum SAFE: `TBA`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).\n\nWhile some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.\n\nConcentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. \n\nThe following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:\n\n* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume \n    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period\n    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility \n*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP\n    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced\n* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks\n    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiex2m345ibzurmui7f3vz7l5w23sv53ej6fj5tppcqcphfsf3p2l4)\nSource: [karpatkey - Dune Analytics - ](https://dune.com/karpatkey/gho-debt-and-token-metrics)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreib2sefybdb73e7g4wksg7mk5wlj3ul53plmw3hrpbmpltn3wlxzu4)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-pools)\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiabucrlngizdmx25lzi23uorxsgkzoxm6da7tksdmhnw7cbpqqvue)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-committee)\n\nThe next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:\n\n* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD \n* Reducing price volatility\n* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations\n* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools\n* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases\n\nThese efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). \n\nThough there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:\n\n| Objective | Category | Budget   |\n| --------  | --------  | -------- |\n| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |\n| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |\n|Total| | 500k GHO|\n\nIt is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Performance Indicators\n\nThe below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:\n\n| Description| Optimal Value|\n| --------  | --------  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |\n| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\nThe [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. \n\nEach of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.\n\n# Specification\n\nSwap the following assets for GHO:\n\n* 250k aUSDT\n* 250k aUSDC\n\nCreate an allowance for 500k GHO.\n\nALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n1. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [TEMP CHECK] Treasury Management - Create and Fund GHO Liquidity Committee\nAuthor: @TokenLogic\nDated: 2023-09-08\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication presents Aave DAO the opportunity to create and fund the GHO Liquidity Committee for an initial 3 month duration.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the coming weeks, we expect the voting base to reallocate gauge votes away from GHO liquidity pools. This is largely due to those voting for GHO pools incurring an opportunity cost by not participating in the bribe market.\n\nIf the Aave DAO was to lock all of its BPT for veBAL, the gauge vote is equivalent to 1.8% of veBAL. Even with some voters continuing to support GHO, a good portion of the 7.7% will move to other pools. There is also the impact of [AIP-42](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-update-balancer-ecosystem-holdings/14682) for the DAO to consider. Voting support from external teams is expected to taper beyond what Aave DAO can replace with its own strategic assets. Furthermore, as the liquidity pools continue to grow additional gauge voting support is required to maintain the APR over time. Whilst the Aave Safety Module (SM) has the potential to be a more long term sustained solution, integrating BPTs that contain GHO, this requires time to develop and should not be rushed.\n\nMeanwhile, the [GHO price](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/) is consistently trading between 96 cents and 99 cents. When the liquidity in the GHO/Aave Boosted Pool was withdrawn, the GHO peg improved. This is because the pool was >85% GHO and had minimal USDC, USDT and DAI deposits. Increasing the GHO borrow rate is also expected to support the GHO peg as minting GHO to farm rewards in liquidity pools is less profitable.\n\n![|602x231](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B7_4E7_tF8xRZe5tUFyoeXnJB3UbWDs7C7aGaohFzMjxM_aBGLmMvAREOjrtIS5yppMcrUaov3Q18-jIGcnjJk4x17wy91VheIUZSkIa0Y2a9Ay_kLTLRZ0w6zKR8PEpjE3jqJIBPzfF)\n\nThe LUSD/GHO pool on Maverick, is also heavily concentrated in GHO and migrating this liquidity to a wider liquidity band pool is expected to also help support the peg.\n\nCreating several concentrated liquidity pools is expected to help improve the GHO peg. These pools will have wide and narrow ranges. Liquidity will need to be migrated from the wide range to the narrow range pool over time. This will require more active management than what on-chain governance allows.\n\nThe recent CRV acquisition indicates the DAO will likely be supporting a GHO/crvUSD pool on Curve Finance. The current CRV holding can be used to kick start a pool, however additional support is likely to be needed to continue growing the pool. There is also a GHOFRAXBP pool being setup by the Frax team which can be co-incentivised. Pending how these pools progress, additional scope/budget may be added at a later stage.\n\nGiven the time sensitive nature of needing to support GHO liquidity, this publication proposes creating a Liquidity Committee with an initial budget. The committee shall focus solely on GHO liquidity and shall consist of a relatively small highly skilled team.\n\nThe Liquidity Committee can support GHO whilst other initiatives are being considered. Even after GHO liquidity pool receipt tokens are integrated into the SM, the Liquidity Committee can participate in bribe markets to boost the yield on the SM integrations.\n\nLonger term the DAO should revisit the impact of the committee and determine if it is still required. Furthermore, the composition of the committee should be revisited at a late date. With this in mind, this proposal suggests the Liquidity Committee’s initial mandate shall last for a 3 month duration.\n\n# Liquidity Strategy\n\nDetails on the liquidity strategy are to be detailed in a separate forum post. The liquidity strategy is to be implemented on the following Decentralise Exchanges:\n\n* Balancer\n* Maverick\n* Uniswap via Bunni\n\nThis forum post is to focus on the creation of the Liquidity Committee and associated fundings.\n\n# Performance Measures\n\nThe following performance measures are proposed:\n\n* Time GHO peg is above 98.5 cents and 99.0 cents\n  * % above/below 98.5 cents over trailing 7 days\n  * % above/below 99.0 cents over trailing 7 days\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Maverick\n  * Target $5M\n* TVL in GHO Pools on Uniswap\n  * Target $5M\n* Improvement in swap size for defined price impact via Cowswap or Paraswap\n  * 0.25% and 0.5% price impact to USDC\n* TVL in Balancer Liquidity Pools\n\nTarget $10M ($5M per pool)\n\nThese measures will be shown on the GHO Analytics platform provided by TokenLogic.\n\n# Committee Structure\n\nThe Liquidity Committee is to consist of 7 signers and will utilise a 4 of 7 SAFE to implement transactions. To ensure there is smooth operational consistency, there are distinct roles within the committee.\n\nTokenLogic will perform the following function:\n\n* Provide analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy\n* Liaise with teams that support the protocols hosting the GHO liquidity\n* Lead & Coordinate the committees weekly activities\n\nAll signers are to provide the following support:\n\n* Provide critical feedback / help refine the strategy\n* Verify and sign transactions\n\nIt should be noted, that actively managing liquidity takes time and effort to stay up to date with the attest events happening across all the protocols supporting GHO liquidity. Verifying transactions as a signer is also a notable time commitment.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe initial 3 months funding for the Liquidity Committee is as shown below:\n\n* 406,000 GHO - Liquidity Incentives\n* 5 ETH - Gas\n\nA breakdown of the Liquidity Incentive budget is shown below:\n![|602x224](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B_P69n971i9uu38kLAiBQKpiESXHTZJc__Q6PKuvWCxxp7ZaHn7zU-eEVpFSHFcD1W2ZurPx49T-W4Dg0fY25krVHC07nZ0_XCQtyylq9LPafWuxv-G4Ca-19mWfE2-URZ-6BL94nIhH)\n\nA more detailed breakdown of the incentive budget and strategy can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801).\n\nThere is a nominal 5 ETH allowance included in the budget. This amount was arbitrarily selected and ensures the SAFE & signing wallets are well funded.Some transactions can be executed directly from the SAFE.\n\nAny funds not used shall be returned to the Treasury or rolled over into supporting the next iteration of the Liquidity Committee.\n\n# Specification\n\nA Gnosis Safe will be created, this SAFE will hold funds and implement the quests. A small, high context team is proposed to implement the strategies modelled by the TokenLogic team.\n\n|Signer|Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|Matthew Graham (TokenLogic)|0xb647055A9915bF9c8021a684E175A353525b9890|\n|Dydymoon (TokenLogic)|0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f|\n|Emilio|0x9C3E82658d10064121048A21c69978D3400abb25|\n|Marc (ACI)|0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4|\n|Figue (Paladin)|0x009d13E9bEC94Bf16791098CE4E5C168D27A9f07|\n|Solarcurve (Balancer)|0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3|\n|TokenBrice (DeFi Collective)|0xAA7A9d80971E58641442774C373C94AaFee87d66|\n\nTo fund the multisig, the following assets within the Treasury are to be swapped to GHO:\n\n* 406,000 [aEthDAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x018008bfb33d285247a21d44e50697654f754e63?a=0x464C71f6c2F760DdA6093dCB91C24c39e5d6e18c)\n\n5 ETH and 406,000 units GHO are to be transferred from the Treasury to the Liquidity Committee multisig.\n\nAddress: `here`\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

Currently, the SM is overly concentrated in AAVE via direct AAVE staking and ABPT staking which is a Balancer v1 80/20 AAVE/wETH liquidity token.\n\nThis publication seeks to explore the community's appetite to diversify the SM asset base and vary the portion of users' funds which can be auctioned in the event of a shortfall. Currently, 30% of user deposits are at risk when depositing into the SM.\n\n# Motivation\n\n@bgdlabs is currently proposing to upgrade the [SM architecture](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-v1-5/12148) to support the launch of GHO, by enabling stkAAVE holders to access cheaper GHO borrowing rates. Further to this, Llama has kick started the conversation around migrating AAVE liquidity from Balancer v1 to v2 in this [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-safety-module-update-part-i-migrate-aave-weth-balancer-v1-pool-to-balancer-v2/12748).\n\nSeveral comments relating to the AAVE concentration and auction mechanism have been made on the forum which can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/size-x-aave-auction-safety-module/11984), [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029) and [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-extend-safety-module-coverage-to-polygon-v3/11876/4).\n\nThis publication presents three distinct categories for inclusion in the SM.\n\n* Single Asset\n* Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions\n* Stable Asset Liquidity Positions\n\nThe net change to the existing implementation is the introduction of a third category, Stable Asset Liquidity Positions. The existing AAVE and ABPT represent Single Asset and Volatile Asset Liquidity Positions.\n\nAlthough any Liquidity Provider (LP) position can be included, G-Uni, crvLP, BPT etc… This publication will initially focus on the overarching concept and how BPTs could be integrated.\n\nBPTs were selected due to Aave’s relationship with Balancer DAO and the veBAL holding which the community may elect to utilize here. It should be stressed, Aave DAO will elect which assets are to be included and the varying levels of slashing for each category.\n\nAssets considered for inclusion should have minimal counterparty risk and display great on-chain liquidity amongst other considerations such as price correlation with Aave Protocol’s TVL during varying market conditions.\n\nLlama proposes three initial asset categories to be created within the SM.\n\nThe slashing parameters update aims to reduce the price impact on the AAVE token in the case of a shortfall event. We propose adding different levels of slashing to each category, as follows:\n\n## Single Assets\n\nThe current single asset, with 30% slashing, is AAVE. This proposal introduces other assets to this category with the goal of reducing the concentration of AAVE inside the insurance fund.\n\nPossible assets for consideration inside the SM Single Asset Category include, not limited to:\n\n* AAVE\n* ETH and/or wstETH\n\nIf the community elects with the introduction of additional assets other than AAVE, then each asset could be considered individually. This publication retains the 30% slashing feature for Single Asset.\n\nThe inclusion of wstETH may attract additional incentives from Lido DAO, therefore Llama prefers having the ability to distribute multiple rewards types with external teams able to distribute their own token. Something similar to the Emission Admin role on Aave v3 will suffice.\n\nLlama preference is for wstETH over wETH due to improved capital efficiency by enabling users to earn an overall higher APY from being a SM depositor. wstETH has become a major trading pairing token on Balancer and it has ample liquidity across various pools to route swaps through. Additionally, the stETH-ETH discount has reduced significantly (0.9938:1 for 100K ETH sold, which also demonstrates [very deep liquidity](https://swap.defillama.com/?chain=ethereum&from=0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84&to=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).\n\nLlama would also encourage Lido DAO to indicate any potential support for this type of integration between the two protocols as inclusion in the SM would act to help retain or grow wstETH adoption via the creation of a unique use case for wstETH relative to other LSTs.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 30% retained for single assets.\n\nInitial assets proposed: AAVE / ETH and/or stETH\n\n## Risks Considerations\n\nIf LSTs (such as wstETH) are included in the SM, it creates a price divergence risk which, if sustained, can reduce the cover in the SM and create an unfair distribution of the rewards between ETH & wstETH. Post redemption the main risk consideration for LSTs becomes counterparty risk which if it materialized would lead to a significant discount to the LST price in ETH terms.\n\n* To limit the de-peg risk, the SM could stop incentivizing below a defined ratio, so the total value would then be deduced from the total cover value. This acts to mitigate counterparty risk without requiring governance intervention.\n\nBased upon technical feedback relating to the ease of implementation, Llama may revise this section of the publication.\n\n## Volatile Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn addition to the replacement pool for the 80/20 AAVE/wETH pool on Balancer v1, to be determined by an earlier publication. This publication presents two other pools of strategic importance to Aave DAO for inclusion in the SM.\n\nThis publication presents the prospect of creating an 80/20 GHO/wETH (or wstETH) which offers less impermanent loss than a 50/50 pool whilst also providing very deep liquidity for risk off events which see spikes in stable coin swap volumes which can often lead to stable coins trading above $1.\n\nFor the following categories, up to 75% of the current budget could be allocated.\n\nMax slashing proposed 45% for volatile BPTs\n\nInitial volatile BPTs proposed: B-80AAVE-20wstETH (or Part I proposal results) & B-80GHO-20WETH\n\nEven if not yet created, this is probably the most interesting addition to this category as the trading volume of this pool will generate an important yield for LPs. The second pool could also be converted into a [Balancer Core Pool](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-19-incentivize-core-pools-l2-usage/3329) by replacing ETH by IBTs as described in Part I.\n\n## Stable Liquidity Provider Tokens\n\nIn this third category, this publication presents an initial pool consisting of the Balancer [3pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x79c58f70905f734641735bc61e45c19dd9ad60bc0000000000000000000004e7) and GHO. Like other categories, in the future, additional assets can be added. If the community elects to launch BB-A-USD/GHO on Balancer or a stable coin pool on Curve, then this section can pivot to include the Curve pool.\n\nMax slashing proposed: 60% for stable\n\nInitial Stable BPT proposed: B-3Pool/GHO\n\nThis pool introduces a stable asset to the SM design and generates a significant amount of the coverage as 60% of the TVL can be slashed with very low price impact across the broader ecosystem. This is especially the case if something like Cowswap’s auction mechanism was to feature in the new SM auction mechanism.\n\nBy integrating a GHO pair to the SM, Aave is essentially helping bootstrapping GHO adoptions through incentivised liquidity. Aave will also earn revenue from the GHO borrowing rate.\n\nIf the community elects to proceed with 3CRV/GHO, then this would increase the SM smart contract surface area through diversifying exposure concentration away from Balancer to include Cuve Finance and potentially Convex Finance risk as well.\n\nThere is also the option of adding additional pools which could include GHO, MAI, LUSD, FRAX and others once live like crvUSD etc…\n\nThis proposal can be implemented independently from the following parts. In this case, “classic” gauges would be advised. Otherwise, the strategy & smBPT gauges discussions will be outlined & discussed in Part III.\n\n# Technical Specifications:\n\n* Remove the BPT 80/20 from the current main module (30% slashing)\n* Deploy two other modules on the SM for the new categories (45% & 60% slashing)\n* Implement the new assets voted on Part II for the new categories\n* Create the new pools depending on vote results\n\n# Voting Options\n\nYAE - Implement Changes\nNAE- Rework Proposal\nABSTAIN\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe Llama is not compensated by any of the mentioned communities outside of Aave.\n\nLlama is an unpaid delegate within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nMembers who contributed to this proposal are not angel investors or advisors to any of the mentioned communities but some do hold small holdings in those communities tokens.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n# References\n\n1.
