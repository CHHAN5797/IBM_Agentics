Eligible users can subscribe and redeem these assets onchain. This initiative is also meant to facilitate the flow of value into Aave Protocol through collateralization of these tokenized assets.\n\nCurrently, the Aave DAO has limited revenue from RWAs, yet the RWA market is growing substantially with more institutions interested in pursuing RWAs. To accelerate this revenue stream, Aave Labs proposes a white label Aave Protocol instance for centralized and permissioned Horizon assets.\n\n# How Does the Horizon RWA Instance Work?\n\nThe Horizon RWA instance connects institutions to permissionless stablecoin liquidity while ensuring compliance with issuer requirements. This will allow tokenized asset issuers to enforce transfer restrictions at the token level and maintain asset-level controls, while keeping DeFi composability. Qualified users, permissioned by RWA issuers, can borrow USDC and GHO. With Aave DAO approval, a separate GHO Facilitator will enable GHO minting with RWA collateral, offering predictable borrowing rates optimized for institutions. This enhances security, scalability, and institutional adoption of RWAs in DeFi.\n\nHorizon provides a structured approach to institutional participation, expanding access to permissionless stablecoin liquidity.\n\n![|699x430](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe1XaRQG7gZuCbRtBMs1SaDmq81G3G4EAaiE90sD0M-xtuk0MtpDwgrshfDPoFGomLhvxJtneKoPCSaVoVRDbqigA0yfJ-MHV8ilMHVggb0QAF3Cc7IudLDigRdoUktvQPaqtwNkg?key=rGRH6EIjJd6Q7YqlNKaFjz3H)\n\n## Key Design Components\n\n* Permissioned RWA token supply and withdrawal mechanisms\n* Permissionless USDC and GHO supply functionality\n* Stablecoin borrowing by qualified users\n* Dedicated GHO facilitator with newly minted GHO on demand\n* Permissioned liquidation workflow\n* Integration with RWA-allowlisted ERC-20 tokens\n* Asset-level permission management by RWA issuers\n\n# Specification\n\n## Strategic Benefits for the Aave Community\n\nThe Aave Protocol’s permissionless design is a core strength. However, integrating permissioned RWAs presents challenges that go beyond smart contract development, requiring an offchain legal structure, regulatory coordination, whitelisted liquidations and active supervision—functions not readily available within the Aave DAO infrastructure.\n\nTo scale RWA adoption in the Aave ecosystem, Horizon’s RWA instance will launch as a licensed instance of Aave V3, maintaining strong alignment with the Aave DAO.\n\n## Revenue Share Mechanism\n\nAave Labs is proposing a 50/50 revenue share with the Aave DAO from the Horizon instance’s Reserve Factor and GHO revenue. In comparison, the revenue split in the RealT RWA instance is 20/80, with 80% going to RealT. Since Aave Labs is closely aligned with the Aave DAO, this proposal offers the DAO a larger share of revenue than other RWA partnerships, while covering legal, compliance, finance, operations, engineering, regulatory affairs, institutional onboarding and business development from Horizon’s share. Aave Labs will bear most of the upfront costs and risks to bootstrap Horizon, covering operational functions, with no grant request to the DAO.\n\n## Growth Incentives\n\nGiven the permissioned requirements of this instance, we would expect the instance to grow slower than permissionless markets (especially compared to those with incentives). To accelerate the growth of the Horizon RWA instance, Aave Labs will contribute $500k in incentives (paid in AAVE), with an additional proposed $500k matched by the Aave DAO. Creating a total amount of $1M in symmetric incentives, aligned with the revenue sharing structure.\n\n## GHO Adoption & Revenue\n\nWe are also proposing that the Aave DAO dedicates a direct minting GHO facilitator, with initially 1M GHO, that can be scaled up to 5M GHO based on the recommendations of the Liquidity Committee.\n\nHorizon enables institutional borrowing against RWAs with GHO as a primary liquidity option, alongside USDC, which is expected to:\n\n* Drive GHO adoption\n* Enhance the liquidity and stability of GHO\n* Strengthen GHO’s role as a settlement asset\n* Generate revenue through GHO borrowing\n\n## Operational Support for the Horizon Instance\n\nSimilar to the WLF instance approach and its configuration, and considering the nature of the market and supported assets, Aave Labs proposes a dual-role setup with clear separation between “Operational” and “Executive” responsibilities for the instance. While the Operational role encompasses basic management of the instance (ownership and upgrade of the contracts, execution of governance proposals), the Executive role oversees risk management, assets listing, and general configuration.\n\nThe proposed framework assigns the Operational role to the Aave DAO, enabling the community and its service providers to manage the Horizon RWA instance and ensuring that governance and basic operational administrative controls are aligned with DAO oversight.\n\nIn parallel, the Executive role would be assigned to Aave Labs, providing the independence necessary to effectively configure and manage the instance. This division of responsibilities enables agile adaptation to evolving market conditions, alignment with institutional requirements, and supports strategic expansions into new networks.\n\nThis structure ultimately strengthens the DAO’s institutional revenue streams, fosters ecosystem growth, and leverages Aave Labs' institutional expertise to navigate complex regulatory environments.\n\n**Role application across Aave V3 and V4:**\n\n* Aave V3: Aave DAO will manage the instance’s operations (for example code upgrades), while Aave Labs retains permissions to enable/disable assets, collaborate with risk managers to configure risk parameters and price oracles, target specific networks for deployments, and administer supply/borrow caps.\n* Aave V4: With Aave V4’s modular design, Aave Labs will propose the optimal configuration of the instances upon release.\n\n# Considerations by the Aave DAO\n\nBased on community discussion of the previous Temp Check, Aave Labs made changes to address community feedback. With the above outlined new structure, Aave Labs requests approval for the Horizon RWA instance—a white label instance based on the existing [Aave DAO framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-framework-for-instances-and-friendly-forks/19659).\n\nHorizon’s RWA instance will expand the Aave ecosystem’s institutional reach while preserving its permissionless integrity. As a licensed instance, it generates new revenue streams for the Aave DAO, accelerates GHO adoption, and reinforces Aave’s leadership in the DeFi ecosystem. Additionally, as mentioned in the previous Temp Check, the Horizon RWA initiative is not meant to exclude other RWA initiatives from other Service Providers or third parties, which are encouraged to further expand the Aave Protocol’s presence in the RWA space.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Engage with the community and service providers to refine the detailed proposal\n2. If consensus is reached on this TEMP, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage\n3. If the TEMP snapshot outcome is YAE, incorporate stakeholder feedback and move proposal to ARFC stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

By leveraging Aptos’s innovative features—especially its use of the Move programming language—this move seeks to make the protocol more efficient, accessible, and resilient, positioning Aave to serve a broader audience and adapt to the evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nIf approved by the Aave community, Aave V3 will launch on Aptos Mainnet with a carefully chosen selection of assets, guided by community input and curated by Chaos Labs and Llama Risk.\n\nThis initiative aims to extend Aave into the thriving Aptos ecosystem—unlocking innovative growth opportunities and enhancing the value for both communities.\n\n# Background\n\nThe Aave Protocol has been EVM-native for over 6 years, ensuring widespread cross compatibility, a robust developer ecosystem, and significant network effects over the years both in terms of user base and liquidity. However, it also brings limitations, especially considering the existence of many non-EVM blockchains that offer different advantages such as lower transaction fees, higher throughput, and more advanced consensus mechanisms. In addition to purely technical advantages, many non-EVM blockchains can allow the Aave community to expand to an entirely new ecosystem, previously inaccessible user groups, and introduce new product possibilities.\n\nAptos is a blockchain designed for building scalable and secure dApps. Developed by former leaders of Meta’s Diem blockchain project, it aims to address some of the limitations in existing blockchain systems such as throughput, scalability, and security. With a TVL of approximately $958.64M and growing rapidly, Aptos is the 11th largest chain by TVL.  Its robust infrastructure offers high transaction throughput, low, predictable fees, and advanced security through the Move programming language that make Aptos an ideal platform for DeFi applications.\n\n# Motivation\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos represents a groundbreaking expansion as it marks Aave’s first deployment on a non-EVM blockchain. This strategic move is significant as it opens up new technological frontiers, diversifies Aave’s ecosystem, and underscores its commitment to innovation.\n\nBy leveraging Aptos’ innovative technology and developer community, Aave can address diverse financial needs, attract new users, and drive greater innovation in the DeFi sector. This deployment aligns with the Aave community’s strategic goal to explore new technological possibilities and tap into a wider pool of talent and resources.\n\n### Key benefits of deploying Aave V3 on Aptos include:\n\n**1. First Non-EVM Deployment:**\n\n  * This deployment is a significant milestone as Aave’s first move beyond EVM-compatible blockchains. It positions Aave to explore and integrate with new blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its resilience and broadening its reach.\n\n**2. Early Mover Advantage and Strong Brand:**\n\n  * Aave is a leading brand in the DeFi space, with a strong reputation and market share. By deploying on Aptos, Aave captures early mover advantages on a high-performance blockchain, similar to its strategic expansions to Avalanche and other L2s. This can attract both seasoned DeFi users and new participants exploring Aptos.\n\n**3. Aptos’ Strategic Position:**\n\n  * The Aptos team, with their background from Meta’s Diem project, has strong connections and expertise in finance, social and gaming sectors. Integrating Aave into Aptos complements these areas by adding a mature financial layer, essential for a complete blockchain ecosystem.\n\n**4. High Transaction Throughput:**\n\n  * Aptos supports up to 30,000 transactions per second (TPS) crucial for DeFi protocols like Aave that handle a high volume of transactions, including loans, repayments, and interest accruals. This high throughput can significantly enhance user experience and enable new use cases that require high-frequency transactions.\n\n**5. Enhanced Security with Move Language:**\n\n  * Aave v3 introduces sophisticated risk management tools and improved security protocols. The Move programming language used by Aptos has inherent security advantages, such as preventing reentrancy attacks. This alignment can lead to a more secure DeFi lending environment, leveraging Move’s safety features and formal verification.\n\n**6. Transaction Cost Efficiency:**\n\n  * Aave v3 focuses on gas efficiency, critical for reducing transaction costs. Aptos’ efficient processing capabilities further complement this by potentially lowering transaction fees even more. This makes Aave more accessible and attractive to a broader range of users, from retail participants to institutional players.\n\n**7. Modular and Flexible Architecture:**\n\n  * Aave v3’s modular and flexible architecture facilitates easier upgrades and expansions. Aptos supports upgradable smart contracts and a flexible account model, enhancing this aspect. This allows for seamless implementation of updates and improvements without significant disruptions or migrations.\n\n**8. Economic Benefits for the Aave DAO:**\n\n  * Market Share Growth: Access to new markets and user bases, specifically in APAC and Korea where Aptos has a strong presence.\n\n  * Revenue Growth: New markets and user bases can significantly increase transaction volumes and generate additional revenue streams.\n\n  * Incentives: Aptos Foundation has committed to provide up to 2M APT in liquidity mining incentives and rewards depending on performance in order to attract users and liquidity providers, increase adoption and boost the ecosystem’s growth. Aptos Foundation will work closely with Chaos Labs on determining the appropriate level of incentives relative to caps set.\n\n***By deploying Aave V3 on Aptos, we will have the first non-EVM deployment through which we can reach new user bases and tap into an ecosystem primed for high-demand DeFi applications, ensuring our protocol remains at the forefront of innovation.***\n\n# Specification\n\n## Risk Parameters\n\n> ARFC has been updated by ACI to reflect latest Risk Parameters provided by Risk Service Providers 2025-04-30\n\nWe recommend using Chainlink data for each asset, with the same setup for sUSDe as on Ethereum Core. \n\n## Specification\n\n| Parameter | Value | Value | Value | Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | APT | USDC | USDT | sUSDe |\n| Isolation Mode | No | No | No | No |\n| Enable Borrow | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Enable Collateral | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Loan To Value | 58% | 75% | 75% | 65% |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 63% | 78% | 78% | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 10% | 5% | 5% | 8.5% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20% | 10% | 10% | 20% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% |\n| Supply Cap | 1,000,000 | 25,000,000 | 40,000,000 | 14,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 500,000 | 23,000,000 | 37,000,000 | - |\n| Debt Ceiling | - | - | - | - |\n| UOptimal | 45% | 90% | 90% | - |\n| Base | 0% | 0% | 0% | - |\n| Slope1 | 7% | 6% | 6% | - |\n| Slope2 | 300% | 40% | 40% | - |\n| Stable Borrowing | No | No | No | No |\n| Flashloanable | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No | No | No | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No | Yes | Yes | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A | sUSDe/Stablecoin | sUSDe/Stablecoin | sUSDe/Stablecoin |\n\n### sUSDe/Stablecoin\n\n| Asset | sUSDe | USDC | USDT |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Collateral | Yes | No | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes | Yes |\n| LTV | 90.00% | - | - |\n| LT | 92.00% | - | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 4.00% | - | - |\n\n## Technical Adaptation of Aave V3 to Aptos\n\nSince our last update—and following the successful TEMP CHECK snapshot vote—we have made significant progress in tailoring Aave V3 for Aptos. We have been actively engaging with the community through regular development updates and rigorous testing on the Aptos testnet while involving security auditors at every step. Our extensive efforts have ensured that Aptos is now fully prepared to host Aave’s next-generation protocol.\n\nKey areas of effort included:\n\n**1. Deep Protocol Understanding:**\n\n  * Comprehensive study of the intricate financial models and smart contract design of Aave V3, ensuring that the full complexity of the protocol is faithfully reimagined on Aptos.\n\n**2. Mastering Move and the Aptos Ecosystem:**\n\n  * Immersion into the Move language, its ecosystem, and best coding practices. This included analyzing standard native libraries, thoroughly understanding the Aptos VM architecture, and evaluating reference projects to inform our design choices.\n\n**3. Architectural Innovation:**\n\n  * Addressing Solidity limitations by rethinking architectural decisions in Move, with careful consideration given to gas optimization, safety, and security. This process ensured we employed best practices tailored to the Aptos environment.\n\n**4. Robust Development Process:**\n\n  * Building an MVP to evaluate model robustness, deployability, upgradability, scalability, and security. We re-implemented end-to-end, unit, and integration tests (including backward compatibility tests) and set up comprehensive pipelines for testing, compilation, deployment, audits, and documentation.\n\n**5. Tooling and Infrastructure:**\n\n  * Developing a complete front-end interface, a TypeScript SDK, and a custom fuzzer to stress-test our implementation. Additionally, we prepared the monitoring services, indexers, Rust-based services, and all necessary infrastructure to support a seamless go-live, including initial configuration, tokens, and faucets.\n\n**6. Governance Considerations:**\n\n  * Special attention was given to designing a governance strategy that aligns with the needs of a protocol on a new chain—starting with community guardians after launch, with future plans to integrate a full governance solution if market conditions warrant.\n\nThe UI is live and fully integrated with the TS SDK ensuring that developers can interact with the protocol and provide valuable feedback during the testnet phase. This level of preparation reflects our commitment to delivering a secure, efficient, and maintainable version of Aave V3 on Aptos.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-25 at 11.39.15.png](ipfs://bafkreibl3fjhchcmri3d7i7wuoiqfbhfafrhvnx34rfxqu3mqhgdplynea)\n\n\n### Architectural Changes\n\nThis section outlines how the modern architecture and unique benefits of Aptos were capitalized in building this while ensuring the protocol retains its core functionality and top notch security.\n\n**1. Modular Conversion:**\n\n  * *Ethereum Approach*: Aave V3 is composed of multiple interrelated Solidity contracts (e.g., LendingPool, Token Manager, Risk Engine).\n  * *Aptos Adaptation*: Each contract is restructured as a separate Move module. Move’s native module system enforces clear boundaries, enabling better separation of concerns, enhanced security and simplifying future upgrades.\n\n**2. Data & State Management:**\n\n  * *Solidity*: State variables are stored in contracts and accessed via delegatable external calls, which can sometimes lead to state inconsistencies.\n  * *Move*: The use of resources in Move ensures that each asset is uniquely tracked and can’t be duplicated or lost. This strict management helps maintain consistency across the protocol’s state, avoiding re-entrances, double spending and other attack vectors. Also, Aptos has a uniquely defined global storage whose resources can only be modified by the owner of the resources thus preventing the storage from being maliciously modified in a transaction.\n\n**3. Control Access:**\n\n  * *Solidity*: By design solidity allows external contracts to modify our own contract state which makes it hard to control and avoid unexpected 3rd party breaches.\n  * *Move*: Move modules have full control over their apis and do not allow by design delegate-calls (callbacks) to other contracts which prevents unexpected state-changes, re-entrances and other unwanted effects. On top of that, Aptos has a very secure system of allowing external modules to be friends and only scoping them to a particular scope of methods without ever giving control over its own resources.\n\n**4. Dispatch Mechanisms:**\n\n  * *Solidity*: Supports dynamic dispatch mechanism which enables a contract to call any other contract as long as a given interface is implemented. This can be however dangerous and the underlying implementation could often be replaced with a malicious one\n\n  * *Move*: On the contrary supports only static dispatch which introduces a high degree of security as an external call to a module can only succeed at static compilation at which point contract address and implementation are known and immutable.\n\n### Security Enhancements\n\n**1. Formal Verification & Type Safety:**\n\n  * *Move’s Built-in Features:* Move was designed from the ground up to support formal verification. We have engaged with Certora to leverage its built-in verifier for mathematically proving smart contract properties, significantly reducing risks like re-entrancy attacks, integer overflows, and other vulnerabilities common in Solidity.\n\n  * *Resource-Oriented Programming:* Resources in Move can only be created, moved, or destroyed in prescribed ways. This model ensures that token balances and collateral remain consistent and secure throughout all operations.\n\n### Performance and Gas Efficiency\n\n**1. Optimized Transaction Costs:**\n\n  * *Gas Model Comparison*: Whereas Solidity requires significant manual optimization to reduce gas consumption, Move’s design inherently minimizes resource usage. This results in lower fees and more predictable transaction costs on Aptos.\n\n**2. Parallel Execution with Block-STM:**\n\n  * *Enhanced Throughput*: Aptos’s Block-STM consensus allows for parallel transaction processing. This means that high-frequency operations (like loan issuance, repayments, and interest accruals) can be handled simultaneously, reducing bottlenecks and improving overall performance.\n\n**3. Atomic Transactions:**\n\n  * *Consistency*: All operations in Move are executed as part of an atomic transaction. This guarantees that either every part of an operation completes successfully or none do, preventing partial state changes and enhancing reliability. Transactions modifying the same state are executed atomically and linearized.\n\n### Developer Experience and Future-Proofing\n**1. Improved Modularity & Maintainability:**\n\n  * *Move’s Module System*: The modular architecture in Move not only organizes code in a logical manner but also facilitates isolated testing, easier upgrades, and reusability of code components.\n\n**2. Enhanced Tooling:**\n\n  * *Ecosystem Maturity*: The Move ecosystem is evolving rapidly, building improved IDE plugins, debugging tools, and testing frameworks. These tools will aid developers in writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts with greater confidence.\n\n**3. Future Integrations:**\n\n  * *Adaptability*: The structured approach of Move allows for easier integration of new features or protocol improvements in the future. As the Aptos ecosystem grows, Aave V3 can seamlessly evolve to incorporate emerging trends and requirements.\n\n**4. Governance Strategy:**\n\n* *Phased Approach to Governance*: Initially, Aave Labs will retain control of the critical protocol keys while the market is in its early stages. Over the coming months—as the market matures, operates smoothly, and undergoes rigorous verification—we will gradually transition key management to trusted community guardians who will provide oversight and help manage early protocol decisions. In parallel, we will engage with relevant service providers to evaluate the feasibility of integrating the Aave Governance V3 system alongside a.DI, ensuring that future governance processes remain robust and fully aligned with community interests.\n\n### Development & Testing\n\n**1. Testnet Deployment:**\n\n  * A fully functional testnet for Aave V3 on Aptos is already live. This environment is used for rigorous testing of Move modules, simulating real-world scenarios.\n\n**2. Audit & Security Reviews:**\n\n  * Comprehensive internal and external audits are done and ongoing with companies like: SpearBit/Cantina, Certora and OtterSec. These will focus on ensuring that the Move modules adhere to Aave's strict security and performance standards.\n  * After the audits are complete, a Security Contest will go live followed by a comprehensive Bug Bounty program when we go live. This initiative, funded by Aave Labs, the Security Contest will offer a total reward pool of $150,000 paid in GHO stablecoin. The contest is designed to incentivize thorough testing and uncover any potential vulnerabilities, ensuring that our protocol meets the highest security standards prior to the mainnet launch.\n\n**3. Audit Reports**: github com/aave/aptos-aave-v3/tree/main/audits\n\n**4. Developer & Community Feedback:**\n\n  * Continuous feedback will be solicited from our developer community to ensure that the transition to Move is smooth and that any issues are promptly addressed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos presents a significant opportunity to drive Aave's growth and expansion. By leveraging Aptos’s innovative capabilities and the power of the Move programming language, we can build a protocol that not only enhances efficiency and security but also broadens our reach into new markets and developer communities. This strategic initiative positions Aave at the forefront of DeFi innovation, enabling us to tap into emerging opportunities and accelerate ecosystem-wide growth.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Integrate Chaos Labs and LamaRisk suggested assets and risk parameters report once available.\n2. Refine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk providers recommendations.\n3.

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] GHO Aave Savings Upgrade\n\n---\n\n**title: [TEMP CHECK] GHO Aave Savings Upgrade**\n**author: @TokenLogic @ACI**\n**created: 2025-03-04**\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks governance feedback and consensus for creating sGHO and defining the Aave Savings Rate (ASR).\n\n# Motivation\n\nAave's GHO stablecoin is growing strongly during 2025 and is the [20th largest stablecoin](https://defillama.com/stablecoins). Whilst growth to date has been strong, growing from 200M to over 300M presents a different set of challenges requiring a different approach.\n\nTo date, stkGHO launched by @ACI, rewards users for contributing to the protocol's security, has been instrumental to GHO's growth journey and currently represents 67% of GHO's circulating supply. After the Umbrella upgrade, stkGHO will remain vital to Aave Protocol's security and is expected to transition towards a size reflective of the protocol's security needs.\n\nBy sizing stkGHO to reflect the Aave Protocol's security needs, this creates an opportunity for Aave to offer a variety of risk profile yield products. This presents an opportunity for the Aave DAO to introduce a new low risk profile saving product that is expected to lead the next chapter of GHO's growth and adoption.\n\nIntroducing sGHO, a low risk savings product that rewards users for staking GHO by earning the Aave Savings Rate (ASR), that compounds over time.\n\n# sGHO\n\nBy depositing GHO into sGHO, users will earn the Aave Savings Rate by holding an ERC-20 receipt token accruing value over time which is easily integrated with other protocols.\n\nsGHO is to be sustained from revenue generated by Aave Protocol and is specifically designed to have the lowest risk profile of Aave DAO's yield product offering.\n\nThe below outlines key benefits of sGHO's design:\n\n* Interest compounding Aave Savings Rate;\n* No rehypothecation providing instance liquidity;\n* Minimal smart contract risk surface area; and,\n* No Deposit or Withdrawal Fees.\n\nA configurable Aave Savings Rate provides the DAO with sufficient flexibility to offer either a fixed or variable savings rate that moves with the broader market conditions.\n\n## Re-hypothecation\n\nTo minimise risk, deposited GHO will remain in the sGHO contract and shall not be deployed to generated yield. This ensures liquidity is always available for users to withdraw and users are not exposed to any protocol risk.\n\nWhilst depositing GHO held within sGHO appears to be the most capital efficient path, this introduces some exit liquidity risks whereby GHO deposited into a protocol can be borrowed by another user. By using a facilitator to Mint and deposit GHO into the yield source, the same capital efficiency upside can be acheived in a more controlled manner.\n\n## Facilitator\n\nWith sGHO expected to create substantial demand for GHO, facilitators are to provide liquidity for user to access GHO. stataGSMs are to provide GHO liquidity via aggregators to avoid GHO deviating from peg whilst other facilitators support GHO being borrowed into circulating supply.\n\nNew Facilitator(s) can Mint and deploy GHO to earn yield. In doing so, rather than deploying GHO held within the sGHO contract, GHO can be Minted and deployed in a controlled manner by the Gho Stewards. This approach preserves the utilisation of liquidity within reserves enabling it to be optimised for achieving a intended borrow rate and maintaining the peg.\n\nFurthermore, Minting GHO via a facilitator increases GHO circulating supply when borrowed. Overal, this approach is similar to how the Gho Stewards manage GHO and how Sky manages USDS on the Prime instance.\n\nThe process of depoloying any additional GHO facilitator(s) is controlled by DAO governance and will be handled separately to this proposal.\n\n## Supply Cap\n\nWith each unit of sGHO being minted, the Aave DAO provides a defined amount of yield that extends the DAOs financial outlay. In isolation, as the portion of GHO held by sGHO increases, the revenue derived from GHO is distributed across the larger sGHO holding base results in either the Aave Savings Rate being revised lower, or requiring additional funding to sustain the savings rate.\n\nTo facilitate processing large withdrawals from sGHO and users exchanging GHO to another asset, DEX liquidity and GSM holding balances are key to sustaining the peg. With these interwoven co-dependencies in place, a Supply Cap on sGHO is proposed. The sGHO `Supply Cap` will be maintained by the Gho Stewards.\n\n## Fees\n\nTo enhance the user experience, there are no deposit or withdrawal fees applied to sGHO. Being a yield product, creating friction via fees would act to reduce the appeal of the offering placing sGHO at a disadvantage to similar offerings available in the market.\n\n# Introductin Aave Savings Rate\n\nBefore reading on, a brief recap of some key terms referenced within.\n\ni) `Deposit Yield` = `Incentive Yield` + `Native Yield`\n\nWhere,\n\n`Incentive Yield` = Yield derived from incentives, commonly referred to as LM rewards.\n`Native Yield` = Yield derived from fees native to Aave Protocol.\n`Deposit Yield` = Total Yield user receives.\n\nAcross Aave Protocol there are two dominant stablecoins, USDC by Circle and USDT by Tether. USDT is the largest, with an emerging trend of some networks preferring to favour one stablecoin over another. Two fast growing networks, Base and Sonic both exhibit a clear bias for USDC over USDT, of which Base has generated substantial growth for Aave Protocol in recent months.\n\nWhen comparing the Native Yield of USDC and USDT across variaous instances Aave Protocol, USDC was found to exhibit a less volatile and more consistent Native Yield relative to USDT. USDC offers both strong market correlation and lower volaility relative to USDT, both are favourable qaulities for deriving a market correlated savings rate.\n\nThe chart below shows USDT and USDC Native yield across Core instances on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base and Optimism.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 19.11.02](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1tM3LGc1l.png)\n\nWhen specifically comparing USDT to USDC, the chart below provides a clear visual reflecting USDCs smoother Native yield profile relative to USDT.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-18 at 19.15.58](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1AOhUMqyx.png)\n\nThe Core instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum offers the deepest USDC liquidity and for this reason, the Aave Savings Rate incorporated the USDC Native Yield Rate from the Core instance on Etheruem as its preferred `Index Rate` .\n\nThe Aave Savings Rate definition:\n\n`Aave Savings Rate` = `Amp` x `Index Rate` + `Premium`\n\nWhere,\n\n`Index Rate` = Representative of market conditions\n`Amp` = Amplification Factor\n`Premium` = Nominal Amount\n\nA linear function provides sufficient flexibility to curate the yield to be either variable or fixed and to change the `Index Rate` to which the Aave Savings Rate is correlated to. The `Amp` can be adjusted to offset periods of low USDC utilisation, whilst the `Premium` allows for a discrete amount of extra relative yield to be applied.\n\nWhilst the Aave Savings Rate is expected to exceed the GHO Borrow Rate, the differential is to be managed such that it encourages adoption whilst being insufficent to promote arbitrage.\n\n# Beyond 200M GHO Growth Phase\n\nsGHO is the next step towards realising GHO's longer term growth potential, and with a very well capitalised balance sheet, Aave can accelerate the next chapter of GHO's growth potential.\n\nThe introduction of the Aave Savings Rate is expected to stimulate demand for GHO that will initially improve the peg and then lead to new GHO entering circulating supply via the stataToken GSMs. During the early growth phase for GHO, significant traction was achieved by aggressively incentivising growth and then tapering rewards to retain the growth.\n\nAave DAO is in a very fortunate financial position that is supportive of pursuing an aggressive growth strategy that captures the upside during what is a depressed yield market relative to late Q4, 2024. Launching sGHO with a premium to other similar savings products is expected to lead to significant growth whilst balancing the yield profile as to not overly encourage arbitraging the GHO Borrow Rate and Aave Savings Rate.\n\nThe chart below shows sUSDe, SSR, USDC Native Yield and USDS Deposit Yield on Core instance.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-03-02 at 16.08.50](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJloMWzjyl.png)\n\nIn terms of risk profile, sGHO is most similar to sUSDS offering from the Sky Ecosystem. For sGHO to compete, given its relative size, a premium would be required to attract meaningful amounts of capital. The USDS Deposit Yield realtive to the SSR highlights the premium for introducing Aave Protocol risk and the utility of being collateral.\n\nOn a risk adjusted basis, the Aave Savings Rate used for sGHO would fall somewhere between the SSR and USDS Deposit Yield on Aave from a competition for capital perspective.\n\nFurther details on the precise Aave Savings Rate to be used when sGHO launches will be provided in the ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\n# Sustainability\n\nDuring the expansion phase, the Aave Savings Rate is expected to present an appealing interest rate that exceeds the GHO Borrow Rate and the Native Rate of the assets held within the stataGSMs. Especially during the early growth stage, the overal economic balance of GHO revenue and costs is going to be heavily shaped by the proportion of GHO's circulating supply deposited in sGHO.\n\nThe below highlights current and near term GHO revenue sources:\n\n* GHO Borrowed via Core instance;\n* stataToken GSM holdings; and,\n* Facilitator liquidity deposits.\n\nBorrowing GHO that has been minted by a facilitor, generates revenue for the DAO through either Borrow Interest like on Core or Native Yield plus Reserve Factor fees as on Prime.\n\n## stkGHO\n\nLonger term, right sizing stkGHO reflecting the Aave Protocol's security needs, is expected to free up budget contributing to sustaining sGHO. Allocating budget from stkGHO to sGHO is exected to reduce per unit of GHO staked spend and lead to an increase in the circulating supply of GHO. This transition is expected to materially impact GHO's revenue upside.\n\nDetails relating to the optimal yield and amount of stkGHO are presented in the Umbrella forum post.\n\n## stataGSM\n\nThe rollout of stataGSMs across Ethereum, Arbitrum and Base is expected to improve the DAO's revenue streams with currently idle capital being deployed to earn yield for the Aave DAO. On Arbitrum and Base, the GSMs will provide users with the ability to `Transafer` GHO into circulating Suppy.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal is to be further refined at the ARFC stage, the following summarises the key characteristics of sGHO:\n\n* No Re-Hypothecation minimising smart contract risk;\n* Facilitators are to be used to Mint and Deploy GHO for yield;\n* No Deposit & Withdrawal Fees promoting frictionless user experience;\n* Introduce a Supply Cap to limit DAO's financial exposure; and,\n* Aave Savings Rate set by GHO Stewards determines sGHO yield;\n\nExecution and implementation is to be a collaboration between by Aave DAO service providers.\n\nThe Aave Savings Rate, budget and sGHO paramaters are to be finalised during the ARFC stage of the governance process.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nThe TokenLogic team extends its sincere gratitude to all Aave service providers, delegates, and community members who contributed to this proposal’s peer review. Your expertise and insights have been invaluable in refining and strengthening this TEMP CHECK.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to the [ARFC] stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy a Gnosis DAO Credit Line Aave v3 Instance\n\n**Author:** @ACI and Karpatkey\n\n**Date:** 2024-09-20\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a specific Aave v3 instance to extend a GHO credit line to Gnosis DAO using GNO and wstETH collateral.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGnosis DAO, a long term partner of Aave DAO, has expressed a need for flexible access to stablecoins. This proposal aims to address this need by leveraging Gnosis DAO's treasury holdings as collateral for a GHO credit line funded by Aave DAO. By establishing this credit facility, we can enhance Gnosis DAO's liquidity management capabilities while fostering closer collaboration between Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO.\n\nThe proposed credit line will provide Gnosis DAO with a reliable source of stablecoin liquidity, enabling them to manage their treasury more efficiently and respond quickly to market opportunities or operational needs. This arrangement also presents an opportunity for Aave to expand its services to other DAOs, potentially opening up a new market segment. The credit line will also serve as a proof-of-concept for further customized extension of credit to reputable DAOs and organizations in the industry.\n\nThe GnosisDAO GHO credit line is described by the following conditions:\n\n- **Exclusive Borrower:** Gnosis DAO will be the only borrower in this specialised GHO market.\n- **Collateral Requirements:** GNO and wstETH tokens will be the primary collateral. Other potential collaterals can be considered but must be approved at a later stage.\n- **Risk Parameters:**\n  - Borrowing Rate (BR): DSR rate\n  - Other risk parameters will be discussed and decided upon by relevant service providers in collaboration with GnosisDAO during the ARFC phase of this proposal.\n- **Liquidation Process:** Managed by a designated Aave entity to ensure controlled handling of collateral.\n- **Progressive Cap Increase:** An initial Cap of 5M GHO will be configured\n  - Once the initial cap is utilized and the system operates smoothly for a predefined period (e.g., 1 month), the cap will increase progressively.\n  - The increase will be contingent upon maintaining a healthy average Health Factor (e.g., above 1.5).\n  - Further increases will be evaluated based on ongoing performance metrics and governance approvals.\n\n### Benefits for Aave\n\n- A dedicated GHO borrowing market will increase the demand for GHO and its supply.\n- Generates consistent income from the interest paid on GHO borrowing by Gnosis DAO.\n- GNO is first-class crypto asset that is currently securing the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n- Gnosis DAO will be able to further provide liquidity enhancing GHO's value proposition as DeFi stablecoin in mainnet, and specially once GHO is deployed in GC.\n- GnosisDAO is a reputable DAO with one of the largest treasuries and footprint in DeFi.\n\n### Benefits for Gnosis DAO\n\n- Provides Gnosis DAO with a reliable and sustainable credit line to support its operations and growth.\n- GNO as collateral will increase the treasury's capital efficiency and help in yield generation by borrowing GHO and putting it to use.\n- Tailored risk parameters offer better borrowing conditions compared to other lending markets.\n- Permissioned liquidation within Aave representatives will ensure proper collateral management, minimizing the risk of market manipulation, price volatility and sudden large sell-offs, also protecting Aave from excessive losses.\n- With the implementation of karpatkey's infrastructure and risk management best practices, tooling and monitoring will be put in place to ensure the debt position is properly managed at all times.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Gnosis DAO credit line will implement the following:\n\n- Credit Line Amount: 5 million GHO tokens to start, with the option to size up based on risk service provider feedback and DAO governance process.\n- Collateral Assets: GNO and wstETH\n- Authorized Users: Limited to Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO\n- GHO Borrow Rate: Set to match the current sUSDS rate of 6%\n\nThis credit line will be implemented as a specialized Aave v3 instance with the following key features:\n\n- Customized access controls to ensure only Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO can interact with the instance\n- Tailored risk parameters for GNO and wstETH as collateral assets\n- Regular reporting and monitoring mechanisms to track the usage and health of the credit line. ACI will propose further methods for safe management of this credit line pending further discussions with Gnosis DAO and risk service providers.\n\nBy implementing this credit line, we aim to provide Gnosis DAO with a flexible financial tool that leverages their existing treasury assets while maintaining the security and transparency inherent in Aave.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI did not receive compensation for creating this proposal. ACI and employees are holders and stakers of GNO as well as delegates within the Gnosis ecosystem. Gnosis DAO and Aave also share some service providers including finance service provider Karpatkey.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

The proposed contributions extend over the three themes detailed below: Treasury Management, GHO adoption and the Aave Stack.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership has created significant value for the Aave DAO across all three focus areas detailed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/phase-i-summary-karpatkey-tokenlogic/17962). GHO's peg, liquidity, and growth prospects have each improved dramatically over the last 6 months. The DAO's finances are more transparent than ever before and the DAO is firmly positioned for growth.\n\nBuilding on the success of Phase I, we seek to extend our collaboration with the Aave Community for another 6 months. Phase II of our engagement is to focus on enabling GHO and Aave to grow market share through prudent financial management and contributing to numerous growth initiatives. Our three primary focus areas are summarized below:\n\n* Treasury Management\n* GHO Adoption\n* Aave Stack\n\n\n## What to Expect\n\n### Treasury Management\n\n**Asset Management** \n\nThe Aave DAO receives revenue in the form of revenue-generating aTokens for each deployed lending market. Whilst that reduces the need to deploy assets beyond the protocol itself, this creates a need for continual rebalancing of asset holdings.\n\nTo facilitate streamlining routine operational tasks, the [Finance Steward](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570) role, which has been already introduced to the Aave community, will be developed. Given the ability to create allowances, streams, perform transfers, assets bridging, and swaps within pre-approved guidelines and without AIPs, we expect the governance overhead around treasury management to decrease significantly.\n\nThe GHO Finance Steward's capacity to perform swaps will also be improved by the implementation of the [Aave Swap](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-swap-upgrade/15311) contract. With this tool, the DAO will be able to acquire assets in a timely and targeted manner, and to support GHO's peg during turbulent market conditions with the ability to create limit orders. \n\n**Financial Security**\n\nA key objective is to define the DAO's annual budget and secure sufficient funds to ensure DAO operations under stressfull market conditions. As the DAO's revenues have exceeded the burn-rate and currently holds more assets (about $145M at [end of June](https://reports.karpatkey.com/?dao=9&month=6&year=2024&currency=USD)) than planned expenses, this proposal will target to cover a [six months' runway](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/runway) matching holdings with expense tokens or token class as deemed appropriate for capital efficiency. This approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Deploying bridging contracts (as required);\n* Bridging Aave funds between networks;\n* Alocating assets for capital efficiency. In particular, migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and\n* Swapping assets to align expenses and holdings.\n\n\n**Aave Analytics**\n\nReporting and analytics functions will be expanded to provide the utmost transparency into the DAO's financial status and overall performance of the protocol, and to support informed decision-making and analysis of the Aave ecosystem. This includes the [Aave Portal](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/) and the [Aave Treasury Report](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), which shows detailed information on DAO holdings and treasury performance.\n\nThe Aave Portal will continue to evolve to showcase the performance of the Aave Protocol and GHO's adoption. Over the next 6 months, the portal will expand to include all revenue sources (incl. Accrued), assets holdings and expenses (incl. budgets) in granular detail, whilst also beginning to include high-level performance tracking across existing covered deployments.\nSeveral legacy community Dune Dashboards will be integrated into the Aave Portal, where they will be maintained and expanded upon over time.\n\n\n### GHO Adoption\n\n**Oversight**\n\nDuring Phase II, GHO's growth is expected to accelerate and expand to several networks. To nurture and maximize the growth potential of GHO, its success hinges on the ability to hold its peg and scale simultaneously.\n\nAs a GHO Steward, we will continue to manage key GHO and GSM configurations, including Borrow Rate, GSM Caps, and GSM fees. As the Treasury Managers, we will ensure the GSM is adequately funded, targetting a collateralization in the range of 5% to 10% of total supply, and that GHO swaps are performed in a manner supportive of retaining a tight peg.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nWe will continue to lead the operations of the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC), overseeing the liquidity growth across different protocols. This includes\n\n* Adjusting liquidity incentives to maintain sufficient market depth;\n* Defining and executing direct liquidity incentives;\n* Leading initiatives that create utility for GHO;\n* Optimizing the utilization of the DAO's strategic voting assets;\n* Supporting GSM Integrations with aggregators;\n* Ensuring GSM are adequately funded;\n* Supporting future D3M, Facilitator, and Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) initiatives; and\n* Support efforts to integrate GHO to Centralized Exchanges, and fund managers.\n\n**Growth**\n\nAs GHO continues to grow beyond Ethereum, our efforts will expand to support those new deployments to ensure adequate liquidity and peg stability is maintained. We will continue to work with teams that build with GHO and advocate for the adoption of GHO wherever practical.\n\nWhen GHO is mature enough to support deploying Protocol Owned Liquidity, we will actively contribute to the creation of sGHO and balancing the needs for sGHO and stkGHO within the Aave ecosystem. \n\n### Aave Stack\n\n**Safety Module Management and Optimisation**\n\nThe Safety Module (SM) currently presents exposure risks due to its reliance on the DAO's native token and its deployment solely on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nWith multiple instances of the SM being deployed, we will continue to perform the following:\n\n* Transition from AAVE emissions;\n* Introduce new categories;\n* Amend emission schedules; and,\n* Progressively align protocol exposure with SM holdings; \n\n**Aave Liquidity Network**\n\nWith upcoming changes in the Aave product stack, including the Liquidity Network and the stablecoin's multichain deployment, new challenges will arise in integrating these aspects with other products. We will actively participate in coordination and consulting to support the streamlined and successful deployment of these features.\n\nWhere practical, sunsetting of legacy v2 markets will be supported through continual parameter adjustments to encourage users to migrate to the latest instance of Aave Protocol.\n\n\nBy addressing these challenges, our team aims to support the DAO in achieving sustainable growth and resilience in a rapidly changing environment.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController will be called to create two streams with a start time block 1718673864:\n\n**karpatkey**\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days\nAddress: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\n**TokenLogic**\nStream: 250k GHO over 180 days\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses deployment and testings costs.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond the Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave ecosystem. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

    "summary": "The proposal seeks approval for the Horizon RWA instance, a white label fork of Aave Protocol focused on institutional real-world asset tokenization with permissioned compliance layers. It aims to unlock new revenue streams for the Aave DAO and accelerate GHO adoption. Timeline voting patterns show unanimous early and sustained support for 'For'. The forum discussion reflects mixed sentiment with strong technical scrutiny and some concerns about governance roles and process, but overall recognition of the strategic value. Historical similar proposals with strong 'For' support generated positive market and TVL responses, reinforcing the potential benefits. Negative sentiment and critique focus mainly on governance structure and coordination, not on the core business case.",
