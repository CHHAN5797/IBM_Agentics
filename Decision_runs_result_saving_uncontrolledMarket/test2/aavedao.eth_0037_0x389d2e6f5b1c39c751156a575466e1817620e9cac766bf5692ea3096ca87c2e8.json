        "body": "[TEMP CHECK] Onboard pufETH to Aave V3 Core Instance\nDate: 2025-01-23\nAuthor: Amir (Puffer Finance)\nSummary\n\nPuffer Finance (https://www.puffer.fi/) proposes adding pufETH as a collateral asset in Aave’s Ethereum V3 market. pufETH is a liquid restaking token that enables users to earn both Ethereum staking rewards and additional returns through restaking on EigenLayer. Its growing adoption, deep liquidity, and robust security measures make pufETH a strong candidate to enhance Aave’s asset offerings and attract additional liquidity.\n\nBackground\npufETH is the liquid staking token of Puffer Finance, the only premissionless liquid restaking protocol built on Ethereum. By leveraging EigenLayer’s restaking capabilities, pufETH allows users to participate in Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with as little as 2 ETH, offering enhanced returns and decentralized validator participation.\n\nKey highlights of pufETH and Puffer Finance include:\n\nGrant:\n\nEthereum Foundation for developing Secure-Signer\nInnovative design\n\nLeading anti-slashing design for AVSs and validators\nFirst preconfirmation AVS on EigenLayer with 2.8M ETH of economic security\nHigh Adoption and TVL:\n\nPuffer Finance holds over $279 million (~80K ETH) in total value locked (TVL) within its ecosystem, with an additional $141 million integrated across DeFi platforms like Curve, Pendle, and Karak.\n\nPuffer has established approxmiately $11 million pools of pufETH on Curve (Curve.fi)\nSecurity and Trust:\n\nPuffer has been audited by 10 leading firms and employs Secure-Signer technology and anti-slashing mechanisms to safeguard user funds and validators.\nSix security partners audit Puffer’s code base.\n\nPermissionless Participation:\n\nPuffer’s anti-slashing technology allows for permissionless and decentralized validator participation, ensuring robust network security while reducing slashing risks.\n\nStrong Industry Backing:\n\nPuffer Finance is supported by top-tier investors such as Binance Labs, F-Prime, Franklin Templeton, and Coinbase Ventures.\n\nBenefits for Aave\nYield Opportunities:\n\nBy listing pufETH, Aave users can earn Ethereum staking and restaking rewards in addition to traditional borrowing and lending income. This enhances capital efficiency and provides a competitive advantage over other lending platforms.\n\nSecurity and Transparency:\n\nPuffer Finance’s advanced security measures and transparent on-chain operations ensure a high level of trust and reliability for borrowers and lenders.\n\nDiversification and Market Growth:\n\nAdding pufETH as the only permissionless LRT allows Aave to diversify its collateral offerings, catering to a growing demand for liquid staking assets. This can further increase Aave’s TVL and protocol activity.\n\nIncentives\nTo encourage user participation and support the listing of pufETH on Aave, the Puffer Finance Foundation proposes:\n\nGovernance Incentives:\n\nAllocating up to 10% of Puffer’s $CARROT (Puffer’s onchain incentives) token supply to incentivize borrowers and lenders interacting with pufETH on Aave. These incentives will reward early adopters and help seed liquidity in the pufETH market.\n\nBorrowing and Supplying Rewards:\n\nA portion of the $CARROT token incentives will be distributed to users borrowing against or supplying pufETH on Aave, enhancing protocol activity and adoption.\n\nSpecification\nDetails of the onboarding of the asset will be discussed at ARFC stage.\n\nToken Contracts\nEthereum: 0xd9a442856c234a39a81a089c06451ebaa4306a72\nChainlink Feed\n0xDe3f7Dd92C4701BCf59F47235bCb61e727c45f80\nConclusion\nListing pufETH on Aave represents a significant opportunity to integrate a highly liquid and secure restaking token into Aave’s ecosystem. By offering additional yield opportunities, diversifying collateral assets, and providing robust security, pufETH can contribute to Aave’s growth and strengthen its position as a leader in DeFi lending markets.\n\nThe Puffer Finance team is committed to collaborating with Aave’s risk assessment partners and the community to ensure a smooth and compliant listing process.\n\nNext Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\nDisclaimer\nCurrent proposal has been edited by ACI, as this proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI did not received payment for proposal edition and is not affiliated with Puffer Finance.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0.",

        "body": "## [ARFC]  Add rsETH to Aave V3 Ethereum\n\n## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-08-12\n---\n\n> ARFC has been updated with Risk Parameters provided by both Risk Service Providers after having reservations with exchange rate oracles. 2024-08-12\n\n### **Summary**\n\n[Kelp DAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/) is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, rsETH, to Aave V3 on Ethereum. In addition, rsETH depositors into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Motivation**\n\n**KelpDAO** (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.\n\n**Latest stats**:\n\n- USD 800 Mn+ (~270k Eth) TVL\n- 20K+ restakers onboarded\n- Accepts ETHx, stETH, sfrxETH, and Native ETH as collateral\n- Live across mainnet and L2s such as Arbitrum and Polygon zkEVM\n\nKelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits).\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to introduce a new asset class LRT (Liquid restaking tokens) to Aave and add to the diversity of LST/ LRT category.\n\n**Restaking Innovation**\n\nKelpDAO’s innovation in the restaking ecosystem has been focused on bringing about the following benefits to users and services-\n\n- Restakers\n    - Liqudity for restaked assets (stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH and Native ETH)\n    - Access to additional staking rewards\n    - Participate in DeFi using rsETH\n- AVSs\n    - Bootstrap economic security\n    - Lowered incentive spends\n- Operators\n    - Higher revenue earning potential\n    - Service onboarding and community support\n    - Marketing for node delegation\n\n### Specification\n\n*> Risk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-08-09 and ARFC has been updated.* It is recommended listing rsETH using an exchange rate oracle. \n\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 19,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,900 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 72% |\n| LT | 75% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 15.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | ETH-Correlated |\n\n### CAPO\n\n| maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent | ratioReferenceTime | MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9.83% | monthly | 14 days |\n\n\nDetailed explanation on Kelp’s technical architecture - [Technical Architecture - Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/technical-architecture)\n\nKelpDAO will have its own token $Kelp that will be the main governance token of Kelp protocol. Kelp token holders will be able to participate in governance related matters including Whitelisting/ delisting of Assets, Node operators, AVS’, setting and updating fees for Kelp protocol.\n\nKelp’s on-chain stats can be viewed on [Dune](https://dune.com/kelp_dao/dashboard-catalogue).\n\n**Liquidity Pools for rsETH**\n\nFollowing are liquidity stats for rsETH:\n\n- rsETH has >55 Mn USD liquidity across several DEXs on the mainnet including\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) - $38 Mn\n    - [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/pools/ethereum/0x059615EBf32C946aaab3D44491f78e4F8e97e1D3) - $12.42 Mn\n    - [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x7761b6e0daa04e70637d81f1da7d186c205c2ade00000000000000000000065d) - $5 Mn\n    - Few others\n- ~$10 Mn+ average daily trading volume (Last 7 days on 12th May)\n\n**Oracles**:\n\nrsETH is supported by Chainlink and Redstone oracles. Posted links below to the Oracle contracts:\n\nChainlink calculated price feed: https://etherscan.io/address/0x78C12ccE8346B936117655Dd3D70a2501Fd3d6e6\n\nChainlink market feed: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/rseth-eth\n\nRedstone market feed:\n\n[https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH\\\\\\\\ETH](https://app.redstone.finance/tokens#/app/token/rsETH%5C%5C%5C%5CETH)\n\n**rsETH exchange rate mechanism:**\n\nrsETH exchange rate is defined based on the underlying assets and rewards generated by those assets.\n\nAccepted assets include ETH, stETH, ETHx, sfrxETH.\n\nExchange rate calculation -\n\nA → Total ETH + Staking rewards accumulated from the chain\n\nB → [Amount of ETHx] * [Value of 1 ETHx in ETH]\n\nC → [Amount of sfrxETH] * [Value of 1 sfrxETH in ETH]\n\nD → [Amount of stETH] * [Value of 1 stETH in ETH]\n\nE → Total supply of rsETH\n\nExchange rate (rsETH / ETH) = [A + B + C + D] / E\n\n**Withdrawals and risks**\n\nPrior to this ARFC, the only way to exit rsETH was via DEXs. \n\nNevertheless, KelpDAO users can now unstake rsETH, with an unbonding period of 7 to 8 days, due to Eigenlayer withdrawal period. That also means that any of the LST’s including stETH, ETHx or sfrxETH from Eigenlayer can be unstaked as well.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments:\n\nAnyone who deposits rsETH into Aave will accumulate additional [Kelp miles](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/dashboard/) and EigenLayer points.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n* [KelpDAO’s Dapp](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/)\n* Contract Address:[ 0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7)\n* [GitHub Docs](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-26\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\nThis proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nArtemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 30.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Website](https://artemisfinance.io)\n\n[X](https://x.com/Artemisfinance)\n\nDocuments:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/)\n\nAudit Report:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit)\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Users can undergo staking and liquid staking on Lista DAO, as well as borrow lisUSD against a variety of decentralised collateral.\n    \n    (2)  Lista DAO consists of the following major components working in conjunction:\n    \n    ●  BNB liquid staking token: slisBNB\n    \n    ●  Decentralized stablecoin: lisUSD\n    \n    ●  Participate in Binance launchpool: clisBNB\n    \n\n1. **About lisUSD**\n    \n    lisUSD is a decentralized, unbiased, collateral backed stablecoin soft-pegged to the US Dollar. Users who have collateralized their assets via Lista DAO are eligible to take out a loan in lisUSD against their collateral. lisUSD is generated, backed, and kept stable through collateral assets that are deposited into CeVault functioning as the Lista DAO collateral vault.\n    \n    Currently the total lisUSD borrowed amount has reached over $62M, with over $363M collateral value, ranked as 4th largest CDP among all the chains in terms of TVL, only behind Maker DAO, Avalon and Beraborrow according to Defillama.\n    \n    There is already a strong ecosystem and mass adoption of lisUSD on BNB chain with the integration of major Defi protocols such as Pancake Swap, Venus, Thena, Kinza, APX, Stakestone, Solv, Lido, FDUSD, etc, the onchain liquidity of lisUSD has reached around $20M.\n    \n\n### **Benefits of listing**\n\n1. Enhance liquidity on Aave\n    \n    Lista DAO will mint $1M lisUSD upon the approval of the proposal on Lista DAO governance , the newly minted lisUSD will specially be supplied for Aave core pool.\n    \n2. Multiple layers of yield opportunities for users\n    \n    Lista DAO will provide additional incentives in LISTA tokens to incentivize the supplying and borrowing of lisUSD on Aave, furthermore, users who borrow lisUSD will be able to enjoy up to 40% apr through lisUSD’s Defi integrations.\n    \n3. Innovative Defi strategies\n    \n    Integration of lisUSD on Aave will also allow a variety of possibilities on Defi strategies, therefore further increasing the demand for supplying and borrowing lisUSD, as a result, higher protocol fee will be generated for Aave.\n    \n\n## **Specifications**\n\nDetails will be shared on ARFC stage.\n\n1. lisUSD is native BEP-20 token\n2. Chainlink Price Feed Contract Address of lisUSD: 0x3f5fc2cb37dA3B351F7EF968d72bE2eC3e1da08e\n3. Token Address: lisUSD: 0x0782b6d8c4551b9760e74c0545a9bcd90bdc41e5\n\n### Useful Links\n\n1.

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on Mantle\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-12-20\n---------\n## Simple summary\n\nThe current [TEMP CHECK] proposes deploying Aave V3 on Mantle Network.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMantle Network is an EVM-compatible Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum (rollup), enabling existing Ethereum contracts and tools to operate with minimal modifications. By leveraging a modular architecture, Mantle combines an optimistic rollup design with innovative data availability solutions to reduce costs while maintaining Ethereum’s security. Data availability is managed by an external DA layer, currently powered by EigenDA technology through Mantle DA, with plans to fully adopt EigenDA upon its mainnet stable launch.\n\nBy deploying on Mantle, Aave can take advantage of Mantle’s integration with Bybit products, enabling seamless access to Bybit’s 30 million active users. This creates a significant opportunity to broaden Aave’s user base and make DeFi more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nMantle currently boasts a TVL of approximately $570 million, while its flagship LST (mETH) holds a TVL of $1.85 billion. More details [here](https://defillama.com/chain/Mantle).\n\n## Benefits of deploying on Mantle\n\n- **Accessibility and Distribution**\n    \n    As Mantle is closely integrated with Bybit, Aave’s deployment on Mantle positions the protocol in front of an expanding audience.\n    \n    - This integration creates a gateway for tens of millions of potential new users to access Aave’s lending and borrowing products, making DeFi simpler and more accessible than ever before.\n- **Incentive campaigns**\n    \n    Mantle’s ongoing incentive program, Metamorphosis Season 2 offers a powerful catalyst for user engagement and liquidity growth within the ecosystem.\n    \n    - Restaking mETH into cmETH, participants earn Powder—soon to be convertible into COOK, the governance token of the mETH Protocol—and gain exposure to multiple streams of yield from staking, restaking, and additional protocol rewards. cmETH also accruing value through EigenLayer, Karak, Symbiotic and Veda points.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nThe Mantle team will provide the following, upon its deployment is confirmed:\n\n- 16M units of MNT value at around 19.2M USD valuing MNT at $1.20 ea\n- COOK points and Ethena Sats\n- $20M in USDC/USDT Supply\n- $20M in ETH Supply\n- $50M in other asset supply\n\nMore details will be shared on ARFC stage.\n\n# Specification\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Service Providers and this section will be updated at ARFC stage if proposal moves forward, after successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The ACI is not directly affiliated with Mantle and did not receive any compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
