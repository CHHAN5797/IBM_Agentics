        "body": "# Simple summary\nIntroducing a new Aave ClinicSteward smart contract, with capabilities to liquidate and repay non-healthy positions with bad debt on Aave v3, using funds of the Aave Collector, this way cleaning up all Aave v3 bad debt before the activation of the upcoming Umbrella.\n\n\n\n# Context\nSince the initial Aave v3 activation three years ago, due to the nature of liquidations, the system has accrued a minimal bad debt of approximately $400’000. This amount is pretty irrelevant in comparison with the ~$12 billion outstanding borrowings, but given the imminent activation of the Umbrella system (to automatically cover bad debt), and the recent upgrade of Aave to v3.3 (formally accounting for deficit/bad-debt post-liquidation), we believe it is appropriate to raise a proposal to clean the “legacy” bad debt, and this way start with clean accounting.\n\nThe Aave ClinicSteward is a smart contract that simply facilitates for a permissioned entity to execute the clean-up on behalf of the DAO, by authorizing a constraint budget from the Aave Collector for exclusive usage on liquidations/repayments of unhealthy positions (liquidatable).\n\n# Specification\nThe Aave ClinicSteward is a highly permissioned and constraint steward smart contract, that allows for the following:\n\n- **Batch liquidate**. Allows to liquidate positions on the configured Aave Pool, by pulling the asset to repay from the Aave Collector, and transferring the liquidated collateral back to the Collector too.\n- **Batch repay**. On Aave v3 there are some existing positions pre-Aave v3.3 with “pure” bad debt: they have outstanding borrowings, but exactly zero collateral.\nFor those cases, this steward contract allows to just repay and zero that debt, even if no collateral is recovered.\n\nIn terms of access control, the system is permissioned in the following way:\n\n- To be able to access any funds from the Aave Collector, the Aave governance needs to give FUNDS_ADMIN role to each ClinicSteward associated with an Aave v3 pool.\n\n- There is a strict budget constraint (in USD) for the amount the steward can pull from the Collector (table after).\n\n- A DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE acts as “a super-admin” of the steward, with permissions to enable any other address to call the batch liquidate and batch repay methods. This is designed to be assigned to a multi-sig smart contract, which in our opinion could be one of the denominated currently composed by ACI, TokenLogic and Kpk, with 2-of-3.\nGiven that the initial setup via governance will assign one initial CLEANUP_ROLE, we don’t expect this multi-sig to be used.\n\n- A CLEANUP_ROLE acts as the address that will factually trigger the liquidations/repayments. This is designed to be an EOA, given that its capabilities are limited by:\n  - The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE granting permissions.\n  - The steward contract has a constraint of maximum budget (in USD) to spend, which only the Aave governance can modify.\nOur recommendation is to use an EOA of the Dolce Vita service by ACI for this role, already in use for multiple other aspects now and in the past (migration of deprecated stable debt positions, accrue of fees to the treasury, etc).\n\n- The contract is not designed to have any funds at rest, so it has Rescuable capabilities to send any token there to exclusively the Aave Collector.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of budget constraints per network (maximum allowance that the ClinicSteward will be able to use from the Collector), the idea is to be able to cover current levels of bad debt per network, with some extra margin on top.\nThis allowance can be potentially renewed in the future, but only via another Aave governance proposal.\n\n| Network | Maximum allowance |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ethereum core | $30’000 |\n| Ethereum prime | $5’000 |\n| Polygon | $30’000 |\n| Avalanche | $350’000 |\n| Arbitrum | $60’000 |\n| Optimism | $5’000 |\n| Base | $15’000 |\n| Metis | $1’000 |\n| Gnosis Chain | $1’000 |\n| BNB Chain | $2’000 |\n| Scroll | $1’000 |\n| ZKSync | $1’000 |\n| Linea | $1’000 |\n\n*Total expenses will potentially be substantially lower than “Maximum allowance”, as in the majority of the cases, some collateral will be sent to the Collector, even if this is lower than the debt of the position.\n\n** v3 Avalanche being substantially higher than in other networks is due to the USDC de-peg event on 11th March 2023\n\n\nIn addition to all its constraints, the ClinicSteward is been audited by Certora, and we will share the report on the Aave governance forum once completed.",

The protocol's TVL and net profit growth have largely outpaced market conditions thanks to the coordinated efforts of service providers appointed by DAO governance.\nThe Aave protocol is also the clear leader on every network Aave has deployed to, and when given a choice, DeFi users leverage Aave over alternatives.\nThis has allowed the Aave DAO not only to \"cover its own bills\" but also has built [a large treasury of ETH and stablecoins](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/treasury).\n\n \n![treasury.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihrskqratcejxrmldlzopv4lj42esks3cgel2kugnd3ijzlt4leui)\n    \n\nAdditionally, during the past couple of quarters, the DAO explored revenue sharing with the Merit program, which is essentially a redistribution of the protocol's net stablecoin excess revenue to the GHO minters and stakers to support aligned behaviors and the growth of GHO. Alongside Merit, the Ahab program, which is funded by protocol net ETH & ETH-correlated assets, is mobilized to attract strategic liquidity in Aave markets, supporting protocol growth in the main & new markets.\n\nWith the ACI, we consider the DAO now ready to explore a further step in the protocol's maturity and would like to submit for governance consideration a clear path for protocol net excess revenue redistribution to the key actors of the Aave ecosystem, creating new positive dynamics and novel synergies within the industry.\n\nThis journey is designed in several incremental steps. This proposal seeks feedback on the journey as a whole as a “TEMP CHECK” and approval to begin the first step via a potential “ARFC”.\n\nTo ensure the DAO's long-term sustainability, new steps will be escalated when the protocol reaches specific growth and net excess revenue milestones.\n\n## Umbrella: A Proposed Safety Module Paradigm Shift\n\nThe Safety Module is a crucial line of defense for the Aave protocol. In case of a shortfall event, and if liquidators do not complete their tasks, the Safety Module is designed to assume the excess debt on behalf of users to avoid or at least mitigate bad debt events.\n\nFortunately, the Safety Module has never been needed for the Aave protocol. The few excess debt events in Aave protocol history have been addressed by governance through the mobilization of \"cash\" DAO treasury funds.\n\nHowever, the current model is inefficient as it relies on secondary liquidity to liquidate Safety Module assets to obtain excess debt assets and clear debt.\n\nWith both GHO and StkAAVE, the primary issue with the Safety Module is that the current $424M hosted in the Safety Module cannot effectively clear $424M of excess debt. This is because:\n\n1. The value of AAVE would be negatively impacted due to slippage.\n2. The GHO peg is unlikely to withstand the mobilization of almost two-thirds of its current supply.\n\nWhile it is highly improbable to encounter an excess debt event of this magnitude (precedent was less than 1% of this amount), the entire model has room for optimization.\n\nTherefore, Umbrella proposes:\n\n1. Segregation of coverage\n2. Elimination of reliance on secondary liquidity\n\nFrom now on, the Safety Module activation should focus on slippage-free debt burn coverage.\n\nUmbrella allows the deployment of aTokens Safety Modules that are more cost efficient and provides better protection to Aave users; This proposal seeks approval on a multi-step journey toward Umbrella Activation and redefines the Role & benefits of the AAVE assets & tokenomics in the Aave ecosystem.\n\n## Umbrella Coverage Adoption Journey\n\nAs an initial and immediate step:\n\nWe propose segregating StkGHO and StkAAVE Safety Module coverages to distinguish protections and improve StkGHO Safety Module efficiency, which would protect the GHO stablecoin.\n\nWith this upgrade, the StkGHO Safety Module is meant to only protect users from GHO debt and is mobilized to clear GHO excess debt only.\n\nGHO is a young stablecoin with limited secondary liquidity. In the current stage of GHO maturity, mobilizing GHO to protect other assets' debt will mean the death of the GHO peg and trust in GHO for limited resources gained.\n\nHowever, in the context of GHO debt protection only, StkGHO is a perfect tool. In case of a shortfall event, GHO can be seized in the Safety Module and used to clear excess debt by burning GHO. This action is absolutely slippage-free and will not impact the GHO peg.\n\nSafety Module users will suffer a below 1 StkGHO <> GHO exchange rate, but it's a risk they willingly accepted by staking.\n\nExample: If there's 100M GHO in the Safety Module and the protocol suffers a $3M excess debt GHO shortfall event, via an AIP, 3M GHO will be seized from the Safety Module to clear the debt. As a result, the StkGHO/GHO exchange rate will drop to 0.97, leading to a socialized net haircut of 3% for all Safety Module stakers (around 6 weeks of the current reward rate).\n\nThis paradigm shift will make GHO the safest and most trustworthy stablecoin in the ecosystem with currently both an average overcollateralization ratio of 2.5 and ~65% of the supply that can be mobilized to clear any form of excess debt without impacting the GHO peg.\n\nThis will de facto make Ethereum StkGHO the first Safety Module adopting the Umbrella standard.\n\nThese changes come at the cost of temporarily reduced overall V3 protection, but as discussed earlier, GHO is not mature enough to be a suitable asset to protect other debts than GHO at this moment. The reduced protection will be covered by the introduction of new Safety Modules in further steps.\n\nWe propose adopting the following:\n\n### Umbrella coverage adoption Journey doctrine:\n\n1. The Legacy Safety Module coverage is set to all live networks Aave V3 debt until replaced.\n2. The Legacy StkGHO SM protects GHO debt exclusively. This safety module becomes the prime candidate for becoming the first Umbrella safety module instance via upgrade.\n3. The Umbrella Ethereum Safety Modules will not automatically cover Aave V3 deployments; coverage must be opt-in by governance vote.\n4. Mid-term: segregate risk further by deploying network-specific Umbrella Safety Modules financed by protocol \"local\" net excess revenue.\n\n\n### StkGHO Migration and upgrade Journey\n\nGHO is growing and is meant to be a profitable product of the Aave protocol. At ~150/175M GHO, GHO is expected to be net profitable for the protocol, with revenue outpacing system subsidies.\n\nCurrently, GHO has a dual reward system with rewards in AAVE sourced from the ecosystem reserve and Merit airdrops sourced from protocol net profits.\n\nWe propose, in resonance with previous governance decisions, to slowly cut rewards of the StkGHO safety module in favor of a potential Umbrella StkGHO safety module.\n\nThe Merit programs yielded great results in terms of growth, peg preservation, and user behavior optimization. We propose to maintain the Merit program in its current form.\n\nThis will keep a dual reward system for StkGHO: a \"base yield\" paid continuously in GHO to stakers and an \"Airdrop\" yield via Merit that can be optimized to reward more users with net positive behavior for the protocol, maintaining \"boosts\" of most wanted behavior but ensuring a sustainable \"base yield\" for this part of the Safety Module. Both of these rewards are financed by Aave protocol net revenue.\n\nIn practical terms, The Legacy GHO safety module has whitelisted AAVE emissions until Oct 2024 and benefit from Merit, we propose to slowly incentivize user migration to the Umbrella stkGHO by letting the AAVE distribution slowly expire and changing the Merit reward focus on Umbrella on the next Merit round post-publication.\n\nThis will slightly increase cost and efficiency by having a few weeks off incentives on both StkGHO safety module but gains on users experience allowing them to migrate at their own pace justifies it.\n\n## A new role for Aave beyond the Legacy Safety module, AAVENomics update.\n\nAAVE is the center of gravity of the Aave protocol. It is the governance asset of the DAO, allowing true control and ownership of the Aave protocol to a degree not achieved in any other protocol in our industry. But as a Safety Module asset, it's simply not efficient enough. AAVE is not a debt token in the Aave protocol and is not as liquid as ETH and major stablecoins.\n\n### End the \"Seize and Sell\" Doctrine\n\nThe \"seize and sell\" doctrine is dangerous as it's inefficient due to slippage, creates the need to subsidize strong secondary liquidity (StkBPT Safety Module), and causes great price pressure on the asset in case of mobilizing the Safety Module. This reduces the cost of acquiring a large amount of AAVE and taking effective control and ownership of the protocol. With historically 15-30% of the Aave supply in the Safety Module and considering the average governance participation, this risk must be seriously considered.\n\nAdditionally, the relatively low maximum slashing of 30% of the AAVE Safety Module means the protocol is allocating funds that are mostly not even mobilizable to protect the protocol.\n\nLastly, the AAVE Safety Module is not sustainable as it is subsidized by the ecosystem reserve that will eventually run out of funds.\n\nWe propose the AAVE Safety Module to not be included in the Umbrella update, StkAAVE will evolve into a staking role acting as a liquidity sink and a way to collect rewards generated from the protocol revenue and other protocol benefits.\n\n### StkBPT Redefinition\n\nThe Aave DAO has spent large amounts of resources incentivizing AAVE's secondary liquidity to maintain the current Safety Module paradigm.\n\nWhile the secondary liquidity of AAVE is important, it should not be a focus of the Safety Module.\n\nThe DAO earned experience with secondary liquidity management with the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) program, yielding great results on GHO peg and growth.\n\nWe propose not including StkBPT from the Umbrella Safety Modules and appoint the ALC to manage AAVE secondary liquidity. We also propose the introduction of a \"Buy & Distribute\" program funded by the protocol's excess revenue, With a budget defined by Aave Finance service providers and management by the ALC.\n\nThe ALC and Aave Finance service providers will continue their journey of decentralization and automatization of these processes, contributing to a future with the human element as removed as possible from these actions.\n\nThis will increase the Safety Module's budget efficiency, make the subsidy of secondary liquidity sustainable, and allow more granular liquidity management. It is expected to optimize the funds needed to maintain the expected outcome.\n\nIn this new system, Liquidity will still be incentivized, but we expect a large optimization in the cost and management of this secondary liquidity.\n\n### Introduction of Anti-GHO\n\nCreating a GHO borrow rate discount was a good idea to align AAVE holders and GHO minters, but the discount mechanism is not efficient in terms of protocol accounting and can be optimized.\n\nWe propose, based on discussions with several service providers, particularly Bgd Labs, the removal of the GHO borrow rate discount and the introduction of a new “anti-GHO” token generated by StkAAVE holders minting GHO.\n\nThe users linearly accumulate anti-GHO, which is claimable at the user's will. Anti-GHO generation is proportionate to the interest accumulated by all GHO borrowers.\n\nAnti-GHO is a non-transferable ERC-20 linked to a couple of special-purpose GHO facilitators that can be used in two ways:\n\n1. Burn Anti-gho to mint GHO used to repay their own GHO debt \"for free.\"\n \n![burn anti gho mint.png](ipfs://bafkreifvldjg2ivjc3x7li4hmv4v4bde5xii6p6vwnlm6cdh62zgtlwv5m)\n    \n\n2. Mint GHO to be deposited on the user’s behalf in the GHO Safety Module and distribute StkGHO to the user.\n\n \n![holders stkaave.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibylsxdbvqvwllrvmkd3x6b7e6dqcvuo6tnbevzz5g7jppb2hjp7a)\n    \n\n\nBoth special-purpose facilitators' \"debt\" will be regularly \"cleared\" by mobilizing GHO from the Aave Collector via Aave treasury regular AIPs to repay, ensuring no long-term unbacked GHO in the protocol.\n\nThis new system is more efficient, increases the alignment of AAVE stakers with GHO borrowers, and officially introduces revenue sharing of part of the Aave protocol revenue to some AAVE stakers, acting as the initial step of a more ambitious excess revenue-sharing strategy.\n\n### Closing the LEND chapter\n\nNearly 4 Years ago, After the launch of Aave V1, the Aave protocol proposed the initial AAVEnomics migrating the legacy asset LEND into the current AAVE token.\nAfter a significant amount of time passed and witnessing the lack of activity of the legacy asset, we take this proposal as an opportunity to close the LEND chapter.\n\nWe consider that 4 years and the amount of time that will pass for these proposals, publications, approvals, implementations, and execution to offer ample and fair notice to legacy users to migrate to AAVE, we propose to deactivate the legacy migrator contract and transfer the remaining balance to the Ecosystem reserve to be mobilized for Aave Stakers and protocol growth.\n\n## Activate Umbrella Atokens Safety Module, initiate “Buy and Distribute” AAVENomics\n\nThe Aave protocol is seen as the industry standard in terms of resilience and safety, making Safety Modules of Aave a popular option for protecting protocol users despite the risks.\n\nAdditionally, ~80% of the Aave protocol users deposit in the protocol but do not have Aave debt. Their use case of the protocol is to seek yield on liquidity provided. These users consider the Aave protocol safe enough to keep their assets inside the protocol contracts for the long term.\n\nThe paradigm shift to \"seize and burn\" instead of the current \"seize and sell\" increases the Safety Module efficiency significantly. The natural progression of this strategy is to mobilize users who consider the Aave protocol safe enough to hold their assets and do not seek to create debt to consider renouncing their Safety Module protection, their borrowing power and short-term aToken liquidity (cooldown period) in exchange for extra yield.\n\nThis is done by adding a Atoken category to the Umbrella Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, these tokens are seized and used to burn debt, just as the StkGHO Umbrella Safety Module will function.\n\nMost of the Aave protocol debt is in wETH and stablecoins.\n\nTherefore, we are gathering feedback on the initiation of Umbrella Atoken Safety Modules with awETH and aUSDC.\n\nThis allows for covering most of the debt in the protocol if these assets need to be mobilized.\nBecause debt can be repaid in aTokens in Aave V3, the available secondary liquidity of these aTokens is not relevant in excess debt clearing.\n\nTo cover debt labeled in other assets, USDC and ETH are the most liquid assets in the ecosystem, making slippage considerations a low issue, especially with a focused scope of Safety Module coverage introduced earlier.\n\naTokens Safety Modules are proposed to be primarily rewarded in their respective aTokens, financed by their respective Reserve Factor collection on their assets and correlated assets.\n\nUmbrella multi-reward support allows for more mid-term synergies for “Re-Staking”, which will be explored further in this TEMP CHECK.\n\nDetails and budgets of these Umbrella Atokens Safety modules should be discussed at the ARFC stage with feedback from both Risk & Finance teams.\n\nWe’re confident this will allow a factually superior coverage of the Aave V3 protocol at a fraction of the current costs.\n\n### Activate a \"Buy & Distribute\" Program\n\nWith the new efficient Umbrella safety modules, it is expected that the protocol revenue surplus will increase. With sustainability reached milestones, this net excess revenue should be mobilized and redirected to token stakers currently funded via the ecosystem rewards contract.\n\nIn terms of rewards, the ecosystem rewards will eventually run out of funds. That being said, we propose that StkAAVE remains compensated in AAVE tokens as stakers are already aligned with the asset. To achieve this, a \"Buy & Distribute\" program is introduced to acquire AAVE assets on secondary markets from protocol revenue and distribute them to the ecosystem reserve. This upgrades the current AAVE safety module in a new “Staking Module”, not part of Umbrella.\n\nThere's little to no difference in user experience from the current situation, but in terms of protocol sustainability, it's a paradigm shift. This new system also introduces a constant demand side for the AAVE asset on secondary markets.\n\nIt is proposed that this program be funded with the net excess revenue of the protocol.\n\nRewards rates will be defined according to protocol net excess revenue and will reflect the actual financial results of the protocols, with periods of higher rewards to potential periods with zero yield.\n\nWe propose that the Aave Finance service providers manage the \"Buy & Distribute\" program via treasury AIPs to increase efficiency in the short term. We believe this process also needs to be part of the Journey of decentralization, and we expect the Aave Finance service providers to contribute to a future with the human element as removed as possible from this program \n\nFor an easier understanding of the new AAVEnomics vision, please consider the following visual representation:\n\n \n![visual representation.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigfqm7tms5yc2homzrgar6ikt6bbplco4cejmqg5i7jqngalmm2eq)\n    \n\n## “Re-Staking” Umbrella Beyond Aave\n\nAave's Safety track record speaks for itself; while Aave had several excess debt events, the DAO never had to mobilize the legacy Safety module. With the Umbrella upgrade, we expect the efficient coverage to increase significantly compared to the current situation, from a theoretical $100m to likely billions of mid-terms.\n\nThe Aave DAO can mobilize and monetize this coverage beyond the Aave protocol. The Aave DAO service providers are risk experts who can give valuable coverage recommendations to the Aave governance.\n\nThe Umbrella multi-token incentives controller allows for rewards in several tokens, and we believe this cost-efficient coverage of already existing significant liquidity will be of high interest for third-party protocols and networks, as shown by the high interest of the “Restaking” DeFi vertical.\n\nWhile the journey to maturity on this vertical is still long, the ACI wanted to share this mid-term vision to the community of a potential new journey for protocol revenue and Umbrella Stakers Yield.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Milestones and Trigger Conditions\n\nWhile the Aave protocol's net excess revenues are at an all-time high, it would be reckless to implement significant new budget spending without considering the protocol's long-term sustainability.\nFrom a user experience perspective, a too-ambitious distribution schedule being forced to halt due to more adverse revenue collection conditions will lead to massive and unwanted frustration.\nThe Aave DAO has always been a conservative actor and has always prioritized long-term sustainability over short-term yield.\n\nWe suggest considering the following elements as key data points to execute changes in Safety Modules in steps:\n\n- Aave Collector net holdings\n- Service providers' recurring budget\n- Merit and ALC program recurring budgets\n- GHO supply\n- GHO 30-day average revenue\n- Protocol 30-day average revenue\n\nThe ACI Proposes this vision to be implemented in 3 differents ARFCs to be sequentially proposed alongside reaching set milestones, we welcome governance feedback on this implementation Journey.\n\n## Initial ARFC Doctrine Adoption and Deployment of First Umbrella Safety Module: StkGHO\n\nAdoption of the Following Doctrine:\n\n1.

Those same LP positions can be deposited into other protocols to earn yield without the prospect of being slashed. These alternative investment options create an opportunity cost and act as a minimum APY hurdle rate when considering investing in Aave’s SM.\n\nThis publication presents an opportunity to enable participants in the Aave SM to earn rewards from other protocols whilst providing a backstop to Aave. The inclusion of GHO pools further helps provide sustained liquidity in the market and generate revenue for Aave through GHO’s borrow rate.\n\nThis introduces the prospect of increasing the sustainability of the SM by enabling rewards to scale with TVL over time which is currently solely dependent upon AAVE’s price correlation with the SM’s TVL given the fixed distribution limitation.\n\nThis proposal will discuss the differences between “classic” gauges and specific ones (“smBPT gauges”) as outlined in the [intro post](https://governance.aave.com/t/discussion-safety-module/12029/6?u=dydymoon), and will introduce the strategy.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Balancer Liquidity Mining system is an automated program which governs the minting of all BAL tokens based on on-chain voting by veBAL holders. veBAL is obtained by joining the canonical 80/20 BAL/ETH Weighted Pool and then locking the Pool shares token (often called BPT, for ‘Balancer Pool Token’) for a time duration up to 1 year. The longer the 80/20 BPT is locked for, the more veBAL and voting power is obtained.\n\nBalancer token emission is currently at 121,930 BAL/week and decreases linearly each year.\n\nveBAL holders can vote each week to redirect part of these incentives to the pool of their choice.\n\nAt the time of writing, 1 veBAL can redirect 0.01187 BAL /veBAL vote/week ($0.0851).\n\nBy using the voting power & voting incentives, it is possible to either leverage better rewards for the similar $$ cost or similar APR rewards with reduced cost. Our calculations are based on delivering a similar APR to users whilst reducing the overall dollar spend on the SM.\n\nLike Curve, the APR of liquidity pools staked on Balancer (BPT-XX-gauge) can be boosted up 2.5x depending on several parameters, such as veBAL boost holdings, value deposited, total TVL of the pool etc. However, having the max boost requires a huge amount of veBAL, which most projects don’t have.\n\nWhile they can still buy boosts on Marketplace like Warden, it can be expensive and potentially limitate the strategy profitability. However, there are projects accumulating a considerable amount of veTokens to mutualize the boost, improving the yield for depositors.\n\nAura Finance is the biggest on the Balancer ecosystem with [27% of the veBAL held by the protocol](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/balancer). These holdings are utilized to boost the users deposits (Most of the pools are currently boosted ~1.4x).\n\nIt’s important to note that 25% of all BAL earned on Aura are captured by the protocol, which distributes AURA rewards in return, the Aura Finance governance token. More details on the AURA distribution can be found [here](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/usdaura/distribution).\n\nThe AURA token can be locked for 4 months for vlAURA without decay on the voting power, which allows to participate on Aura Governance, Balancer gauges votes as it controls the underlying veBAL voting power, and can receive rewards in auraBAL & vote incentives. At this time, 1 vlAURA controls 0.2081 veBAL. Once a gauge is voted on Balancer, the pool is added on Aura Finance in the following days.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to consider staking the LPs deposited in the SM on Aura Finance, to receive BAL + AURA rewards distributed to SM depositors. However, there are different possibilities to reach this goal:\n\n## “Classic” gauges mechanism\n\nAfter a liquidity pool is created, an application is shared on the respective communities governance forum to create a gauge. Upon creation, users are able to deposit their LPs into the gauges to earn rewards.\n\nProjects like Aura Finance receive the BPTs, deposit them into the Balancer gauge and retain a portion of the BAL emission in exchange of their own governance token. Users receive an elevated yield to reward users for the additional smart contract risk and premium for replacing BAL with AURA. Aave could deploy contracts within the SM that extends this concept and enable users to receive Aura Finance and Balancer rewards.\n\nMost projects are proposing to enable the gauge on the BPT assets. This works quite well because they are creating vote incentives (often with their native token) to acquire votes in veBAL & wrappers, directing more rewards to the pool, making it attractive for the community to deposit liquidity.\n\nHowever, if Aave’s SM was to accept the BPT directly and not deposit the BPT into the Balancer Gauge. Any users could deposit & stake their BPT to receive BPT-gauge without depositing in the SM, allowing them to bypass the SM lock period and cooldown to receive the same incentives as SM depositors, so classic gauges invalidates the strategy\n\nThis would create a huge dilution for Aave, which is a large issue when the liquidity also doubles as protocol insurance. If Aave was to offer the same APR as Aura Finance there is no incentive for users to take on the additional shortfall and cool down period lock up risk/opportunity cost.\n\nIn Part IV, the SM upgrade proposal will consider using 75% of the current incentives budget for volatile & stable BPTs categories. That’s 825 AAVE/ day that could either be used to incentivize the pools directly (Not recommended to keep doing liquidity mining for all categories) or to create vote incentives for the associated gauges driving a higher rewards value to the pools.\n\nThis method can still be used for main liquidity pools outside of the SM, but to keep the proposed strategy profitable for Aave, an alternative could be what this publication will refer to as “smBPT gauges” which is a suggestion from Solarcurve.\n\n## “smBPT gauges mechanism”\n\nThe method requires implementing a wrapper in the safety module. The SM contract receives BPT from users, and deposits in the wrapper contract which would mint smBPT received by the SM.\n\nInstead of enabling gauges that accept the BPT, Balancer can approve BAL emissions to gauges which accept the smBPT. Users would have the option to deposit the BPT into Aave’s SM to mint smBPT which will be deposited on Aura Finance which then deposits the smBPT into the Balancer gauge.\n\nThis means that any users could deposit liquidity and receive the trading fees on the underlying Balancer pools, but only users who stake their BPT in the SM would be eligible to gauge rewards.\n\nIf the smBPT gauges are approved by the Balancer DAO, Aura Finance will implement the pools associated with these gauges. The gauges will only accept smBPT. This eliminates the opportunity cost as users can not deposit into Aura Finance or Balancer’s gauge directly and avoid the slashing plus cool down risk. Considering that the SM would mint the smBPT internally, it would be the only contract available to stake on this gauge.\n\nOnce deposited, the SM contract would receive “aurasmBPT-gauge” and mint “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” distributed to the initial BPT depositors.\n\nIf a user wants to withdraw from the SM, he would activate the cooldown period. The SM contract would then burn the “aurasmBPT-gauge” by unstaking from Aura Finance to receive smBPT. It would then unlock and distribute the BPT as well as burn the smBPT and “StkaurasmBPT-gauge” once the withdrawal is done.\n\nAt this point, and while several aspects of the proposals have been updated since the strategy introduction post, this chart should help understand and visualize the overall strategy described.\n\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreih2bqouhr75txq5jog2gi4xdstlorn7wb3qdhjkzhlmhem6ojn7ey)\n    \nConsidering that the veBAL voting power held by Aave is not enough to sustain these pools with good TVL, the goal is to use part of the SM rewards budget as votes incentives.\n\nThe part IV of this proposal will focus on incentives management updates and details on estimations made, while the part V will be mostly about further considerations.\n\n## smBPT Risks\n\nTo implement interoperability and integrate different protocols, several changes are needed, which will result in the upgraded SM contracts having greater smart contract risk than in the current implementation. Introducing smBPT to the SM creates additional Balancer gauge and Aura smart contract risk exposure.\n\nThe current ABPT integration demonstrates the community's willingness to have exposure to the Balancer protocol within the SM. Aave further demonstrated confidence in the Balancer <> Aave partnership via the token swap performed during 2022. Since then, Balancer has launched several liquidity pools which deposit funds in Aave v3 across several networks. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAave and Balancer have been working together since the launch of the Safety Module. Further, BGD has already proposed upgrading to Balancer V2 and Aave Companies have recently [proposed including BPT assets as collateral.](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-staked-atokens-a-new-aave-primitive-exploring-vote-escrow-economies/10406)\n\nAura Finance is a protocol built on top of the[ Balancer system](https://app.balancer.fi/#/) to provide maximum incentives to Balancer liquidity providers and BAL stakers (into[ veBAL](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512)) through social aggregation of BAL deposits and Aura’s native token. Even if the protocol is relatively young (launched on June 3, 2022), the team has an extensive focus on security, having run 3 [audits](https://docs.aura.finance/aura/security#audits): [Peckshield](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S5jnMddjbVUsAdVZtmcIRlL4WhVueSzp/view), [Halborn,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsZ9aAVJ8mobLaJ5-XDejcHdRFK1StjM/view) [Code4rena](https://github.com/aurafinance/aura-contracts/blob/main/audits/Code4rena-Audit-Report-AuraFinance-v1.0.pdf)\n\nAura started a $1 million [bug bounty program on Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/aurafinance/) on June 16, 2022 and to date, no vulnerabilities have been found.\n\nMoreover, Aura was given a rating of [88% from DeFiSafety](https://defisafety.com/app/pqrs/526) which also suggested improvements to protocol documentation (actively being worked on now by contributors).\n\nFinally, some security researchers and developers are closely looped into Aura via its multisig, and general protocol oversight.\n\n## Smart Contract Considerations\n\nAave Governance as admin, can perform the following:\n\n* Add/remove assets into the SM\n* Invoke Emergency power to withdraw of all funds deployed by the SM on Aura\n* Update reward budget influencing the SM yield\n* Update the slashing parameters & associated yield ranges\n\nAave SM as admin, can perform the following:\n\n* Receive BPT and mint smBPT\n* Deposit/withdraw smBPT from Aura\n* Mint/Burn smBPT and aurasmBPT-XX-gauge\n* Claim BAL & AURA rewards\n* Redistribute the rewards to StkaurasmBPT-XX-gauge or StkTokens holders (This can probably done weekly/bi-weekly)\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n* Deploy wrapper contract to wrap BPT into smBPT (BGD)\n* Enable gauges on smBPT voted in Part I & II.

        "body": "# Simple summary\n\nAfter different changes since the initial Risk Stewards [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204), we present to the community the final proposal for activating this system across all Aave v3 pools.\n\nThis version of Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS) include two instances:\n\n- The first is a continuation of the previous design, with the parameters recommendation risk provider (Chaos Labs), with constrained capacity to modify all type of risk parameters on Aave. As extra protection, during the initial period of updates (estimated 1-2 months), BGD Labs will join the Risk Council multi-sig in order to add an additional layer of security review. *Chaos Labs will still be the only decision maker for recommendations as defined on their professional scope with the DAO, with us BGD just being a security contributor*.\n- The second is a pilot version to automate interest rate updates of assets (starting with WETH on Aave v3 Lido Ethereum), based on the newly released risk infrastructure technology Edge, by Chaos Labs.\n\nThe repository can be found on [https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards).\n\n---\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe base motivation of Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS) is still the same as the previously proposed version [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204). After a successful initial iteration for cap updates and different GHO parameters using the Stewards pattern, Aave is prepared to generalize the solution and improve its operational efficiency and reactivity to the market.\n\nRegarding the pilot integration of AGRS with Chaos Labs new Edge infrastructure, it has the following rationale:\n\n1. Whenever aligned with other strategic and technical aspects, Aave should benefit from infrastructure built by service providers, in this case, Chaos Labs.\n2. This pilot will be very non-invasive and with only positive outcomes, as the AGRS layer will guarantee that only acceptable interest rate recommendations will reach the Aave protocol, while ideally having a way more dynamic rate.\n\n---\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## 1. AGRS + Risk provider\n\nThe main version of AGRS will follow the specifications described in the previous Risk Stewards post [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204#specification-3), which can be summarised in the following:\n\n- The following risk params could be changed by the RiskStewards:\n    - Supply Caps\n    - Borrow Caps\n    - LTV\n    - Liquidation Threshold\n    - Liquidation Bonus\n    - Debt Ceiling\n    - Base variable borrow rate\n    - Slope 1\n    - Slope 2\n    - Optimal point\n    - CAPO configurations\n- For each configuration type, there will be a minimum delay associated with how frequently the AGRS can be used, named `minDelay`. Ex. after increasing LTV by 5%, the operator of the AGRS (risk provider) must wait a minimum of minDelay before either doing any additional change.\n- Each configuration type will have an associated percentage-based constraint (in basis points), indicating how much the parameter can be changed via AGRS compared to the live value on Aave v3. These constraints (`maxPercentChange`) can be of 2 types:\n    - *Absolute*. E.g. for LTV a 5_00 `maxPercentChange` means that is possible to change the LTV value by +/- 5_00 basis points, or 5%, compared to the current live value. So if the current LTV is 65%, it is possible to change up to 70% or down to 60%.\n    - *Relative*. E.g. for Supply Cap a 50_00 `maxPercentChange` means that is possible to change the Supply Cap value by +/- 50_00 basis points, or 50%, proportional to the current live param. So if the current Supply Cap is 1’000’000 WETH, it is possible to change it up to 1’500’000 WETH, or down to 500’000 WETH.\n- The system allows to restrict assets for AGRS to not apply changes, to be used for example with GHO.\n- The only entity enabled to use the AGRS will be the assigned risk service provider, currently Chaos Labs. As a temporary security precaution, and to avoid introducing a timelock (given that the system should be resilient enough without it), BGD will review the params updates proposed for correctness, but without any influence on the recommendation itself.\n\n\n---\n\n\nTo start with, this component of AGRS will have the following configurations (from recommendations of the risk provider of the community):\n\n| Parameter | Percent change allowed | minimumDelay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply and Borrow Caps | 100% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| Debt Ceiling | 20% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| CAPO dynamic cap | 5% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| CAPO stable cap | 0.5% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Slope 1 | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Slope 2 | 5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Optimal Point (Kink) | 3% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Loan to Value (LTV) | 0.25% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 0.25% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n\n\nThe principles for them in the initial phase are:\n- Still highly constraint in percentages and time, in order to not deposit too much trust to start with.\n- Similar as with caps updates, all usage of stewards will be previously disclosed on the Aave governance forum, by a framework to be defined by Chaos Labs, the risk provider in charge.\n\n\nAdditionally, the only blacklisted asset will be GHO on Ethereum, given that changes on it are usually done by the ALC (Aave Liquidity Committee) via the GHOSteward, or directly with governance proposals.\n\n---\n\n## 2. AGRS + Edge Infrastructure by Chaos Labs\n\nDays ago, the Aave risk service provider Chaos Labs [announced Edge](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/introducing-edge-the-next-generation-oracle),  a new product innovating on the risk infrastructure ecosystem.\n\nThis new system directly addresses a challenge for risk recommendations on Aave: how to connect as seamlessly as possible the platform of parameters recommendation run by Chaos during the last years for Aave, with the Aave protocol.\n\nWith this activation of AGRS pending, after evaluating the solution, and due to the already long contribution history of Chaos Labs, we decided that is a good opportunity to test out the usage of Edge for a specific parameter: Aave rates configurations for WETH on v3 Lido Ethereum.\n\nThis model will use another instance of AGRS (exactly the same codebase as the other model), but with the following constraints:\n\n- The AGRS + Edge instance will only have configurable rate-related parameters: base variable borrow rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2.\n- Recommendations of these parameters will be submitted to a risk oracle smart contract, from the Edge off-chain infrastructure.\n- Between the risk oracle smart contract and the AGRS contract, there will be a very thin middleware `AaveStewardsInjector` , which will have the following logic:\n    - Will take recommendations from the Edge Risk Oracle side and propagate them to the AGRS contract.\n    - Enforce that only the WETH asset can be acted upon.\n    - Given the protections (percentage constraints and time delay) on the AGRS side and that it is an assumption that risk recommendation will be the time correct on the Edge Risk Oracle, the propagation will be permissionless.\n\n\nRegarding the configurations of the AGRS + Edge instance, will be the following (for only WETH on v3 Lido Ethereum to start with):\n\n| Parameter | Percent change allowed | minimumDelay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate | 0.5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Slope 1 | 0.5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Slope 2 | 5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Optimal Point (Kink) | 3% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n\n\n## Security\n\nIn addition to our internal review and testing procedures, the AGRS have been reviewed by Certora, and the report can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards?tab=readme-ov-file#security)",

Extensive details about its rationale and specifications can be found on Snapshot and the associated governance forum.\n\nThis ARFC delves more into the proposed initial configuration details of the initial phase (Phase 1).\n\n# Specification\nTo recap, the architecture of the new Chainlink SVR feeds to be connected to Aave is as follows:![svr-diagram-arfc.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidkqa26w7eaqaq34a2fnaz6goy7acu6g36w4jy5byb5oqsmtdfl3q)\n\nIn the integration side of Aave, there are two major components to take into account:\n\n- **SVR Feed**. This will be the one plugged into the Aave Oracle smart contracts (with the necessary CAPO adapters on top if applicable), receiving the OEV-recapturing price on-chain.\n- **Fallback feed**. This is a mirror of the “standard” price feeds currently plugged into Aave, without OEV recapture. The SVR Feed has a configurable delay fallback in seconds: as both SVR and Fallback feeds get submitted to their respective mempools in parallel, whenever the OEV doesn’t reflect on-chain for more than the delay fallback seconds but the Fallback does, the price reading is routed to the Fallback feed.\n\nThe fallback mechanism is completely fundamental security-wise, as it gives one important assurance: on average, the price availability of the overall system will be equal to or superior to the current feeds, but even in the worst-case scenario, the maximum delay to read from a “standard” Chainlink feed will be of the configured delay fallback seconds.\n\n## Initial assets configuration: controlled approach\nEven considering that the technology (Chainlink, Flashbots) is battle-tested, and the protection mechanisms embedded into SVR like the fallback, we believe the rollout of feeds should be progressive, only enabling a very limited subset of assets on v3 Core Ethereum during the first month or so.\n\nFrom our discussions with Chainlink, we think the following principles for choosing the initial assets are reasonable:\n\n- The assets consuming the feeds should have a meaningful volume of historic liquidation.\n- The majority of liquidations happening on positions consuming the chosen feeds should be due to those feeds, and not due to other assets. E.g. in positions using AAVE as collateral and borrowing USDC, the majority of liquidations happen due to the AAVE/USD price feed updates on the collateral side, as the USDC/USD feed barely changes.\n- In this first activation batch, major assets size-wise should be avoided: ETH, wstETH, WBTC, weETH.\n- Ideally, we plug in production feeds that will affect assets correlated with major ones, but smaller in size. Both tBTC and WBTC use the hood of the same BTC/USD feed, but the first is ~$82m in size versus the second ~$3b.\n\nWith the previous principles in mind, and also taking into account the extensive testing/simulations performed by Chainlink in their infrastructure during the previous couple of months, the recommendation is to enable the following SVR feeds:\n\n- **BTC/USD affecting exclusively LBTC and tBTC**.\n- **AAVE/USD**.\n- **LINK/USD**.\n\n## Other configurations: fallback delay and its nuances\nWhen choosing specific values per asset for a fallback delay, there are different points of consideration:\n\n- The fallback delay is a mechanism that will not be used on the “happy” path: when the Chainlink DON submits prices to the Flashbots auction, historical analysis shows that the majority of price updates (and so liquidations) are included in the next block, and close to 100% in the range of 1-2 blocks. That means that price reading being redirected to the “public” feed will only happen if a fallback delay is configured to less than 2 blocks (in seconds), or in very edge scenarios when auction participants don’t show up for more than 2 blocks, even if economically sound.\n- Aside from the auction aforementioned average auction speed of 0-2 blocks, configuring too low (e.g. 2 blocks) the fallback delay opens to an edge, but theoretically existing censorship vector: it could be profitable for a builder with control to build the +2 block from next on the public mempool to censor the price update on the 2 blocks on the Flashbots auction, to wait for their to-be-mined block on the public mempool.\nAgain, this vector is very theoretical but technically exists whenever the fallback delay is very short. Any increase in the fallback delay configuration makes the censorship vector exponentially more expensive, as the cost of “capturing” multiple blocks in a row gets increasingly more expensive,\n- Aave is configured very conservatively risk-wise, which means that the difference of processing a liquidation in the same block of price update versus some blocks after doesn’t put the system at all at risk.\nThis will not really be the case on the average scenario of the price being included into the block via Flashbots, as it will precisely incentivise as fast as possible inclusion, but it is a consideration to not configure the fallback delay too tigh, avoiding any type of censorship attack, even if very theoretical.\n\nConsidering the previous rationale, and also using historical analysis from Chainlink showing that there will be no loss on the risk profile of the protocol, the recommendation is to set the fallback delay on BTC/USD, AAVE/USD and LINK/USD to 5 blocks.\nThe Aave DAO via its risk provider will reserve executive power over modifying this parameter by communicating to Chainlink.\n\n## Extra protection: SvrOracleSteward\nGiven the criticality of the infrastructure activation, and to be even extra cautious, we also propose to include a new steward smart contract: the SvrOracleSteward.\n\nThe SvrOracleSteward allows for the Aave Protocol Guardian to replace, on the Aave Oracle side, a feed (e.g. CAPO) consuming one the new SVR by exclusively one used before the SVR replacement. This way, even in the very unexpected worst-case scenario of the new SVR simply not being functional or having a really major issue, the Aave Protocol Guardian could immediately swap back to the standard price feeds currently used in production.\n\nWe don’t expect this mechanism to be used anyhow, but we think it is reasonable as an extra line of defense when enabling a pretty innovative system like SVR v1 Chainlink.\n\n## OEV-recaptured recipient\nWhen using systems like Flashbots for a case like this of SVR, it is necessary to define an address to receive the native currency (e.g. ETH) recapture. Ideally, the Aave DAO would have full control over this address, but in practice, as the Chainlink DON is the entity factually building the transaction and submitting it to Flashbots, they have control over configuring it or changing it.\n\nThe Aave protocol already has a RevenueSplitter smart contract to be used as OEV beneficiary, for any non-100%/0% split between Aave and Chainlink. But given that using it or not is a purely operational consideration (as still Chainlink can change it unilaterally), we will coordinate with them to decide whats the most reasonable venue.\n\nIn any scenario, the final recipient of the OEV fees should be the Aave Collector, and we consider mandatory that distribution to it happens minimum once a week, no matter if via RevenueSplitter or via transfer from the Chainlink side.\n\n## Aave/Chainlink fee split terms\n\nSimilar to any other terms of the Aave <> Chainlink SVR partnership, it is outside of the scope of this ARFC to define the percentage of a split between Aave and Chainlink on the OEV recapture, as we (BGD) are technical service providers, and the community should vote on the configuration separately from those.\nWe will abide by any decision approved by the DAO via ARFC, configuring any technical component accordingly.",
