The goal is to position GHO as the dominating decentralized stablecoin within Linea’s ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation  \n\nLinea is a high-performance, EVM-equivalent zk-rollup developed by ConsenSys, offering ultra-low fees, fast finality, and deep integration with Ethereum infrastructure such as Infura and MetaMask.\n\nAave V3 has already launched on Linea, enabling increased DeFi adoption and liquidity flow. Linea is now launching **Native Yield**, an innovative mechanism that auto-stakes bridged ETH via Lido v3 stVaults, channeling staking rewards into DeFi liquidity incentives on Linea.\n\nDeploying GHO on Linea in concert with these momentum initiatives ensures GHO becomes a foundational stablecoin, enabling synergies with liquidity programs, boosting peg stability, and expanding GHO’s on-chain utility.\n\n## Specification  \n\n### Roles and Responsibilities\n\n| Service Provider           | Responsibility                                      |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| TokenLogic                 | Deploy GHO infrastructure and bridging components   |\n| TokenLogic                 | Configure Facilitator, GSM, and Steward logistics   |\n| Chaos Labs + LlamaRisk     | Review initial risk parameters tailored to Linea    |\n| BGD + Aave Labs            | Review Pull Requests ahead of voting submission     |\n| Certora                    | Cold Review / Audit of Pull Requests                |\n| ACI + TokenLogic           | Design incentives and distribute emissions          |\n| Aave Liquidity Committee   | Coordinate GHO liquidity across Linea DEXs          |\n| GHO Stewards               | Maintain risk parameters post-deployment            |\n\n**ACI Multi-sig Address**: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n**Gho Stewards Address**: `0x8513e6F37dBc52De87b166980Fa3F50639694B60`\n\n---\n\n### GHO Parameters for Aave v3 on Linea  \n\n| Parameter            | Value        |\n|----------------------|--------------|\n| Asset                | GHO          |\n| Market               | Linea        |\n| Isolation Mode       | No           |\n| Borrowable           | Yes          |\n| Collateral Enabled   | No           |\n| Supply Cap           | 5,000,000    |\n| Borrow Cap           | 4,500,000    |\n| Variable Base        | 0%           |\n| Variable Slope1      | 5.5%         |\n| Variable Slope2      | 50%          |\n| Uoptimal             | 90%          |\n| Reserve Factor       | 10%          |\n| Stable Borrowing     | Disabled     |\n| Flashloanable        | Yes          |\n| Siloed Borrowing     | No           |\n\n---\n\n### Facilitator & Bridging Configuration  \n\nDeploy a **GhoDirectMinter** facilitator on Ethereum to support issuance for Linea.\n\n- **Mint Cap**: 15M GHO  \n\n**Bridge Configuration** (e.g., via CCIP or similar):  \n- **Bucket Capacity**: 15M GHO  \n- **Inbound Capacity**: 1.5M GHO  \n- **Outbound Capacity**: 1.5M GHO  \n- **Refill Rate**: 300 GHO/sec  \n\n---\n\n### GSM Parameters (stataUSDT0.linea)  \n\n| Parameter              | Value     |\n|-------------------------|-----------|\n| GHO Bucket Cap          | 10M GHO   |\n| USDT Exposure Cap       | 5M        |\n| Freeze Lower Bound      | $0.990    |\n| Freeze Upper Bound      | $1.010    |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound    | $0.995    |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound    | $1.005    |\n| Mint GHO Fee            | 0%        |\n| Burn GHO Fee            | 0%        |\n\n*USDT deposits into `stataUSDT0.linea` trigger GHO transfers using Ethereum-held inventory via GSM.*\n\n---\n\n### GHO Steward Configuration  \n\n**GhoAaveSteward**  \n- `updateGhoBorrowCap`: ±100%  \n- `updateGhoBorrowRate`: ±5% on optimalUsageRatio, baseVariableBorrowRate, variableRateSlope1, variableRateSlope2  \n- `updateGhoSupplyCap`: Up to +100%  \n\n**GhoGsmSteward**  \n- `updateGsmExposureCap`: ±100%  \n- `updateGsmBuySellFees`: ±0.5% per side (FixedFeeStrategy)  \n\n*Both stewards remain callable only by the GHO steward protocol.*\n\n---\n\n## Budget  \n\nInitial capital will be deployed on Ethereum and bridged to Linea via the facilitator to support liquidity and incentive programs.

With Aave’s anticipated deployment on Ink, bringing GHO to the network simultaneously ensures GHO becomes a foundational stablecoin in the ecosystem from day one.\n\nThis ARFC seeks community support to approve the launch of GHO on Ink, ensuring the coordination of technical deployment, risk management, and ecosystem alignment.\n\nAs learned from previous launches, successful expansion of GHO requires:\n\n* Coordinated implementation of protocol and bridging infrastructure\n* Definition of risk parameters tailored to Ink’s ecosystem\n* Collaboration with local DEXs and applications for utility and liquidity\n* Early incentive programs and strategic ecosystem engagement\n\n## Specification\n\nInk will be the next immediate focus for GHO growth alongside the Aave instance launch.\n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Ink involves the following components and responsibilities:\n\n| Service Provider | Responsibility |\n|----|----|\n| Aave Labs + Certora | Deploy GHO infrastructure and CCIP bridge |\n| TokenLogic | Deploy Facilitator, GSM, and Steward config |\n| Chaos Labs + Risk Llama | Set and monitor risk parameters |\n| ACI + TokenLogic | Incentive design and emissions distribution |\n| Aave Liquidity Committee | Coordinate DEX liquidity |\n| GHO Stewards | Maintain risk parameters over time |\n\nACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nTimeline and exact implementation details will follow in subsequent AIPs after ARFC approval.\n\n### GHO Parameters for Aave v3 Ink Deployment\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n|----|----|\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Ink |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 4,500,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | \\- |\n| LTV | \\- |\n| LT | \\- |\n| Liquidation Bonus | \\- |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | \\- |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 5.5% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 50% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### Facilitator and CCIP Configuration\n\nA `GhoDirectMinter` facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum to support GHO issuance for Ink:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n|----|----|\n| Mint Cap | 15M GHO |\n\nCCIP configuration to support bridging to Ink:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n|----|----|\n| Bucket Capacity | 15M GHO |\n| Inbound Capacity | 1,500,000 |\n| Outbound Capacity | 1,500,000 |\n| Refill Rate | 300 GHO/sec |\n\n### GSM Parameters (stataUSDT0.ink)\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n|----|----|\n| GHO Bucket Cap | 10.00M |\n| USDT0 Exposure Cap | 5.00M |\n| Freeze Lower Bound | $0.990 |\n| Freeze Upper Bound | $1.010 |\n| Unfreeze Lower Bound | $0.995 |\n| Unfreeze Upper Bound | $1.005 |\n| Mint GHO Fee | 0.00% |\n| Burn GHO Fee | 0.00% |\n\nUSDT0 deposits into `stataUSDT0.ink` will trigger GHO transfers from Ethereum-held inventory managed by the GSM.\n\n### GHO Steward Configuration\n\n**GhoAaveSteward:**\n\n* `updateGhoBorrowCap`: ±100%\n* `updateGhoBorrowRate`: ±5% on `optimalUsageRatio`, `baseVariableBorrowRate`, `variableRateSlope1`, `variableRateSlope2`\n* `updateGhoSupplyCap`: Up to +100%\n\n**GhoGsmSteward:**\n\n* `updateGsmExposureCap`: ±100%\n* `updateGsmBuySellFees`: ±0.5% per side (FixedFeeStrategy)\n\nOnly callable by the GHO Steward.\n\n### Budget\n\nTo bootstrap the Ink instance and support initial growth, a specific allowance on Ethereum will be created and bridged to Ink.\n\nALC Ethereum SAFE: `0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b`\n\nInitial liquidity will be sourced via aUSDT0 and routed through Aave LP partners and Ink-native DEXs.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic is not compensated for the creation or coordination of this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

As Aave continues its growth across new ecosystems, it presents a strategic opportunity to extend GHO’s reach alongside it. Sonic’s DeFi sector is currently thriving, and with Aave set to launch on Sonic in the coming weeks, deploying GHO there would be a natural next step.\n\nSonic’s current growth is largely driven by the anticipation of its [upcoming airdrop](https://docs.soniclabs.com/funding/sonic-airdrop), scheduled for June. Users earn points while protocols accumulate gems based on their activity within the ecosystem.\n\nA key part of the early GHO growth strategy on Sonic will be securing liquidity in an Aave Boosted StableSurge Pool on Beethoven, a friendly fork of Balancer v3. This integration enables idle liquidity to be automatically redeployed into Aave to maximize capital efficiency. Additionally, as part of Aave’s collaboration with Balancer, these pools will receive further support, with Beethoven allocating a portion of their “gems” rewards to incentivize GHO liquidity.\n\nJust as with the Base deployment, a well-coordinated strategy is crucial for GHO’s expansion to Sonic. A successful launch will require close collaboration among service providers to build a strong infrastructure, establish appropriate risk parameters, and solidify GHO’s role as a key stablecoin within Sonic’s DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThis ARFC vote seeks community consensus to move forward with GHO’s deployment on Sonic, paving the way for its continued multichain growth and deeper integration across emerging ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposed deployment of GHO on Sonic will require coordination across several key components:\n\n|Service Provider|Responsibility|\n| --- | --- |\n|Aave Labs + BGD + Certora|Deploy CCIP & Aave Protocol Updates|\n|TokenLogic|Deploy Facilitator, GSM & GHO Steward Updates|\n|Chaos Labs + Risk Llama|GSM, CCIP & Aave Protocol Parameters|\n|ACI + TokenLogic|Incentive Program & Distribution|\n|Aave Liquidity Committee|DEX Liquidity|\n|Gho Stewards|Maintain Risk Parameters|\n\nACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe final timeline and technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and outlined in subsequent AIPs, pending approval of this ARFC.\n\n## Aave Protocol - GHO Reserve Parameters\n\n> Updated proposal 2025-03-15 with Chaos feedback\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Asset|GHO|\n|Market|Sonic|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap|2,500,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,250,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|-|\n|LT|-|\n|Liquidation Bonus|-|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|-|\n|Variable Base|0%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.5%|\n|Variable Slope2|50%|\n|Uoptimal|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|10%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|N/A|\n\n## Ethereum <> Sonic Facilitator\n\nA facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum specifically to support Sonic.\n\nGHO is considered to have entered circulating supply when users exchange USDC.e for GHO via the stataUSDC.e GSM on Sonic.\n\nThe initial configuration for the Sonic GhoDirectMinter facilitator as shown below:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Mint Cap|10M Units|\n\nThis is to be implemented by setting the `newFacilitatorBucketCapacity` to to 10M.\n\nReference: [GhoDirectMinter](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-ghodirectminter/20040)\n\n## CCIP Configuration\n\nTo support the launch of GHO on Sonic, the following parameter adjustments are proposed:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Bucket Capacity|+15M Units|\n|Rate Limit Capacity|1,000,000 units|\n|Refill Rate|200 GHO/sec|\n\nThe Bucket increase is additional to the Bucket Capacity at the time to ensure the GSM can be supplied with GHO.\n\nThis is expected to support strong initial growth with the DAO and other expected to be moving large amounts of GHO through the bridge.\n\nReference: [GHO Deployment](https://app.aave.com/governance/v3/proposal/?proposalId=240)\n\n## GSM Configuration\n\nThe below provides the initial configuration of the stataUSDC.e GSM to be deployed on Sonic.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|GHO Bucket Cap|10.00M|\n|USDC Exposure Cap|5.00M|\n|Freeze Lower Bound|$0.990|\n|Freeze Upper Bound|$1.010|\n|Unfreeze Lower Bound|$0.995|\n|Unfreeze Upper Bound|$1.005|\n|Mint GHO Fee|0.00%|\n|Burn GHO Fee|0.00%|\n\nWith GHO being minted on Ethereum and being transferred to the GSM, the Mint() function on the Ethereum instance of stataGSM is to be replaced by Transfer() functionality.

When they differ, the most conservative one is selected.\n\n## [ARFC] Launch GHO on Gnosis Chain\n## author: kpk\n## date: 2025-03-13\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to launch GHO on the Gnosis chain and designate ACI as the Emissions Manager for GHO rewards and incentives. Deploying GHO to Gnosis is one part of kpk’s (formerly karpatkey) [mandate](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-karpatkey-as-gho-growth-service-provider/20206) and a milestone towards sGHO (savings GHO) deployment. Gnosis Chain has low transaction fees, an engaged community, and a rapidly growing suite of DeFi applications focused on RWAs and innovative payment solutions like [Gnosis Pay](https://gnosispay.com/).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe sGHO vault will provide a risk-minimized yield alternative that can be used as collateral for enhanced capital efficiency, debuting on Gnosis Chain. The first step of this deployment is introducing GHO to the Gnosis Chain, which is renowned for its cost-efficiency, active community, and innovative DeFi landscape, making it an ideal environment for GHO. As GHO Growth Service Provider, kpk has been entrusted with driving community engagement, forging strategic partnerships, and ensuring the successful liquidity bootstrapping of GHO.\n\nThis proposal leverages kpk’s expertise and the favorable market conditions on Gnosis to deploy GHO with risk parameters and smart contract implementations that are finely tuned to the unique characteristics of the Gnosis ecosystem. [sGHO deployment](https://governance.aave.com/t/develop-sgho-a-yield-bearing-gho-vault-for-multi-chain-integration/21350), the [enhancements proposed to the GC Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancements-in-aave-v3-gnosis-chain-instance/21214) and future incentives for GHO (subject to an upcoming proposal on both DAOs) will work together to position GHO as a strong player within Gnosis, enhancing the TVL and revenue for Aave on this chain.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe deployment of GHO on Gnosis will be executed through coordinated efforts among various service providers. The necessary smart contracts and supporting infrastructure will be designed and deployed to enable full GHO functionality on the Gnosis chain, including the implementation of any required cross-chain bridge infrastructure to ensure seamless integration within the Aave ecosystem. In parallel, risk and finance service providers will collaborate to establish risk parameters and collateral requirements specifically optimized for the Gnosis environment, incorporating insights gained from previous network launches.\n\nTherefore, kpk is inviting all Service Providers to provide input on their scopes in this proposal. The proposed launch of GHO at Gnosis Chain will have the following key components:\n\n* BGD and Avara (Aave Labs) to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Gnosis Chain network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Gnosis Chain.\n* Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, a strategic plan will be developed to bootstrap initial liquidity on Gnosis, including tailored incentives and partnerships with established protocols in the ecosystem. @ACI will serve as the Emissions Manager for GHO rewards and incentives.\n\n* ACI multisig address: 0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n### GHO parameters\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Asset|GHO|\n|Market|Gnosis|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Collateral Enabled|No|\n|Supply Cap|2,500,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,250,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|-|\n|LT|-|\n|Liquidation Bonus|-|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|-|\n|Variable Base|0%|\n|Variable Slope1|6.5%|\n|Variable Slope2|50%|\n|Optimal|90%|\n|Reserve Factor|0%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|E-Mode Category|N/A|\n\n#### Ethereum ↔ Gnosis GHO Facilitator\n\nA facilitator will be deployed on Ethereum specifically to support Gnosis with this initial configuration:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Mint Cap|10M Units|\n\n#### CCIP Configuration\n\nBridge Facilitator parameters:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Bucket Capacity|+15M Units|\n|Rate Limit Capacity|1,000,000 units|\n|Refill Rate|200 GHO/sec|\n\n#### GHO Stewards\n\nAs with every GHO deployment, GHO Stewards are recommended to be deployed. Stewards would have the same parameter change capabilities as on other chains.\n\n\n### Disclaimer\nkpk is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n### Next Steps\nIf consensus is reached on this ARFC, the proposal will be escalated to the Snapshot stage. Upon a positive Snapshot outcome, service providers will proceed with the appropriate AIPs.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

However, the lessons learned from the Arbitrum launch highlight the importance of coordinated efforts in several key areas:\n\n- Implementing the necessary smart contracts and infrastructure to support GHO on the  network\n- Establishing appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements specific to the Avalanche ecosystem\n- Integrating GHO with existing DeFi protocols and applications on Avalanche to foster immediate utility\n- Collaborating with the community to ensure a smooth launch and widespread adoption\n\nThese factors underscore the significant effort required from all service providers to create a successful launch. This ARFC vote seeks community approval to proceed with the launch of GHO on Avalanche.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThe ACI invites all service providers to provide input on their scopes within this proposal. \n\nThe proposed launch of GHO on Avalanche will involve the following key components:\n\n- BGD and Avara to implement and deploy the necessary smart contracts for GHO on the Avalanche network, including cross chain bridge infrastructure and addition to Aave v3 Avalanche.\n- Risk service providers and finance service providers should collaborate on  appropriate risk parameters and collateral requirements tailored to the Avalanche ecosystem. From learnings on Arbitrum launch, ACI suggests a $25m starting bridge cap to allow for growth using the planned programs from the Avalanche ecosystem.\n- ALC will create a plan to bootstrap initial liquidity for GHO on Avalanche, potentially including incentives or partnerships with existing Avalanche protocols.\n- ACI will coordinate with Avalanche ecosystem teams to promote the GHO launch with appropriate support and incentives. The Avalanche ecosystem has [previously signaled](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci) a large commitment to supporting GHO’s launch on the network.\n- ACI will be the Emission Manager for GHO and aGHO potential rewards and incentives.\n- ACI multisig address: `0xac140648435d03f784879cd789130F22Ef588Fcd`\n\nThe exact timeline and detailed technical specifications for each component will be determined by the service providers and presented in subsequent AIPs, pending the approval of this ARFC.\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | GHO |\n| Market | Avalanche |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 5,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 4,500,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 12% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 65% |\n| Uoptimal | 90% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n## Useful Links\n\n[Avalanche's Proposal on Temp Check: Rollout Plan for Cross-Chain GHO](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-rollout-plan-for-cross-chain-gho/17074/5?u=aci)\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [ARFC], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, service providers will proceed with the appropriate AIPs. \n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
