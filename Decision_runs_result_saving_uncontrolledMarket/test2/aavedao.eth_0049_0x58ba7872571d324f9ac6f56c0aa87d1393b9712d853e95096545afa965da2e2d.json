        "body": "## **Author: ACI**\n\n## **Date: 2024-10-04**\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Summary:**\n\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard EIGEN, the native token of Eigenlayer, in Aave V3 Ethereum Market. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Eigenlayer Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of EIGEN.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4.

        "body": "## Author: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-11-05\n\n---\n> Risk Parameters have been updated accordingly with Risk Service Providers feedback 2024-11-26\n\n\n### **Simple Summary:**\n\nThe current ARFC aims to onboard SCR, the native token of Scroll, on the Aave V3 Scroll Instance. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow SCR, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Scroll token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nScroll is an Ethereum Layer 2 chain which already has an Aave instance deployment and SCR is the governance token for the Scroll L2. By onboarding SCR to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding SCR’s liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing this token:**\n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their SCR to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow SCR against other collateral allowing them to participate in Scroll governance.\n\n**Market Impact:**\n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding SCR except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding SCR as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new L2 ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:**\n\nScroll.\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:**\n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage. \n\nAs disclosed by Marc Zeller, founder of ACI, the ACI Multisig has received 510K SCR on behalf of Aave DAO. Those funds will be coordinated with Karpatkey and Tokenlogic to define best usage of this airdrop. \n\n### **Specification**\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided by Risk Service Providers on 2024-11-25\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Network | Scroll |\n| Isolation Mode | N/A |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 360,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 180,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.0% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Scroll website](https://scroll.io/)\n- [Scroll docs](https://docs.scroll.io/en/home/)\n- [[TEMP CHECK]Onboard SCR to Aave V3 Scroll Instance](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-onboard-scr-to-aave-v3-scroll-instance/19568)\n- [[TEMP CHECK Snapshot] Onboard SCR to Aave V3 Scroll Instance](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x900027a0dc30946b463ce8e57a8901b5fc1158546b4d00acae4d2d823d8de732)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

    "summary": "The proposal to deploy Aave v3 on Tron aims to expand Aave's presence to the second largest EVM blockchain, accessing a substantial stablecoin liquidity pool and user base. Historical similar proposals to onboard assets or upgrade savings modules showed strong community support and positive TVL impact, reinforcing the strategic growth opportunity. Forum sentiment is mixed but leans cautiously supportive, emphasizing potential revenue gains while noting technical considerations with Tron's EVM compatibility. Timeline metrics show unanimous early and sustained support for YAE, and market impacts indicate modest positive TVL and price responses. Overall, the analysis supports a change stance recommending deployment.",
