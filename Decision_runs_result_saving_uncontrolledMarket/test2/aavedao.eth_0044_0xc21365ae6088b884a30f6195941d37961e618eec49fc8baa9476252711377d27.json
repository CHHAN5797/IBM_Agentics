The proposed risk parameters for LUSD will mirror those currently in place for USDC on the same pool.\n\n## Motivation\n\nLUSD is a decentralized stablecoin minted by users of the Liquity Protocol. It has demonstrated its resilience and maintained a stable peg, even in volatile market conditions. By adding LUSD as a collateral asset on the Aave V3 ETH pool, we can offer our users more options for their DeFi activities. Furthermore, the integration of LUSD could potentially synergize with the GHO, enhancing liquidity and further reinforcing the stability of the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed risk parameters for LUSD on the Aave V3 ETH pool are as follows:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 77% |\n| Liquidation Threshold (LT) | 80% |\n| Liquidation Penalty | 4.5% |\n\nThese parameters are identical to those currently in place for USDC on the Aave V3 ETH pool.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Skyward](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-skyward-a-free-service-for-aave-dao-by-aave-chan-initiative/13173/13) program, the ACI has not been compensated by any third-party to present this ARFC.\nAt the time of writing, the author does not hold LQTY tokens but owns some LUSD.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP for final approval and implementation.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

RLUSD intends to bridge TradFi with DeFi use cases, starting with its flagship payments products serving customers in over 70 markets. They aim to establish RLUSD as the de facto stablecoin for lending/borrowing, DeFi, repo, Treasury functions, payments, etc., all within the highest levels of compliance.\n\nOnboarding Ripple's RLUSD extends Aave Protocol's diverse stablecoin offerings to its users. RLUSD users on Aave Protocol may potentially benefit from future rewards programs. This introduction is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nAligning with Aave DAO’s commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand assets, onboarding RLUSD will enable users to leverage Ripple’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. The initial slow launch of RLUSD is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and attract more mainstream users, contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n## Specification- **Ticker**: RLUSD  \n- Contract addresses will be added during the ARFC stage once RLUSD is fully launched.  - Risk parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers as soon as possible, and the ARFC will be updated with that feedback\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Ripple and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, escalate the proposal to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

Adding AAVE to the Base instance is the next logical step in AAVE token integration within the AAVE lending platform. \n\n## Motivation\n\n* AAVE token is a versatile governance token which is already accepted collateral on all major AAVE instances.\n\n-The Base Market is growing in TVL, the addition of collateral options already found on other AAVE instances will increase Base Market growth. \n-There is deep liquidity on Base chain for the AAVE token already.

This would facilitate the same 'Borrow USDC/USDT then stake/swap for sUSDE' arbitrage which happens within the ETH V3 main market, but on Base.\n\nEthena lacks strong foundations on Base L2 for their native yieldbearing stable-coin, sUSDE. The addition of sUSDE to Base V3 AAVE market would facilitate this expansion to the untapped L2 market for Ethena.\n\nBase has seen expansion in its TVL now surpassing Arbitrum by ~15%. Base chain is a small but significant part of total Defi TVL (all chains) of 3%.\nSource: https://defillama.com/chains\n\nUpdated price feeds for USDE and sUSDE could mean one or both will not have to be added to Base V3 in an isolated market.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: USDE and sUSDE\nUSDE L2 Contract Address: [0x5d3a1Ff2b6BAb83b63cd9AD0787074081a52ef34]\n(https://basescan.org/address/0x5d3a1Ff2b6BAb83b63cd9AD0787074081a52ef34)\nsUSDE L2 Contract Address: [0x211Cc4DD073734dA055fbF44a2b4667d5E5fE5d2]\n(https://basescan.org/address/0x211Cc4DD073734dA055fbF44a2b4667d5E5fE5d2)\n\n> Risk Parameters updated 2025-02-17\n\n**sUSDe Market Configuration (Base Instance)**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | No |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 1,200,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | - |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 70.00% |\n| LT | 73.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 8.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | - |\n| Variable Slope1 | - |\n| Variable Slope2 | - |\n| Uoptimal | - |\n| Reserve Factor | - |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | Stablecoin |\n\n**sUSDe Liquid E-mode Configuration**\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Value** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asset | sUSDe | GHO | USDC |\n| Collateral | Yes | No | No |\n| Borrowable | No | Yes | Yes |\n| Max LTV | 88% | - | - |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 90% | - | - |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 4.0% | - | - |\n\n## Useful Links\n\nProject: https://ethena.fi/\nDocs: https://docs.ethena.fi/solution-design/key-addresses\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe current proposal has been edited by ACI, under Skywards.
