        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Finance Steward\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-05-03\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nBuilding upon the success of the [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-risk-steward-phase-1-capsplusrisksteward/12602), this publication proposes creating a smart contract to enable \"Finance Stewards\" to execute on behalf of the DAO pre-approved and budgeted operations.\n\nThis proposal also marks a step forward in defining the asset management framework for Aave DAO, as introduced in the TokenLogic and karpatkey service provider [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).\n\n# Motivation\n\nTo progressively streamline the management of the Aave DAO's funds by shifting approved ARFC proposals from on-chain vote to a trusted Finance Steward implementation.\n\nThe Finance Steward is a smart contract that will act as admin of the collector, it can do the exact same operations as the DAO Executor. The DAO has full ownership of the contract which grants it the ability to delegate permissions and budget specific actions to a Guardian, the Finance team. \n\nThe Finance Steward will enable the DAO to define a core set of financial capabilities to be carried out within strict role-based guardrails. As the role matures or new use cases arise, we plan to bring forward additional capabilities for the DAO to discuss.\n\nEfforts not included in the Finance Steward or being developed will still be covered through the normal governance process. This may include the recommendation to introduce purpose-specific safe multisigs with the intent to minimise governance burden (e.g. ALC, APE, etc…).  This design will map frequent key finance operations to a role-based governance-controlled solution, frequent but long-tail use cases to trust-minimised and efficient multisigs; and important, infrequent or strategic discussions to the full governance process.\n\n\nIt is relatively simple for the Aave DAO to grant granular control over the management of various parameters to Finance Stewards, but the complexity comes in term of decentralisation and self-protection of the protocol.\n\nThe initial introduction of the Finance Steward role will enable the tasks detailed in the Specifications to be performed. \n\n# Specification\n\n## Finance Steward v1.0 (Mainnet Only)\n\nThe initial Finance Steward implementation will work the following way:\n\n* A `FinanceSteward` smart contract will be created with an Owner and a Guardian. The Owner will be the DAO.\n* Guardian of the FinanceSteward contract will be a multisig with multiple signers, to be determined by the DAO.\n* The Collector Contract will be upgraded to have a system of roles whereby the same admin role can be held by multiple addresses, eg: FUNDS_ADMIN by the DAO's Executor and the FINANCE_STEWARD by the multisig proposed earlier.\n* Guardian can migrate assets from v2 and deposit into v3 to support seamless migration of the DAOs assets over time.\n* Guardian can be granted the ability to use the Aave Swapper to exchange assets held in the Treasury\n* Guardian can withdraw and deposit into V3.\n* Guardian can be granted the ability to transfer and stream tokens to pre-approved addresses within a budget, for example:\n    * ACI [Frontier](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-introducing-frontier-staking-as-a-service-for-the-aave-dao/16225) Program\n    * ACI [Merit](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-a-new-aave-alignment-user-reward-system/16646) Program\n\nThe functionality will have the following limitations, enforced on-chain:\n\n* For each Aave market reserve, a [minimum balance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aaysvP2velw0hCBhH3huplumNwuN0FaA_bAZZTdjsmg/edit?usp=sharing) will remain in the collector\n* Tokens to swap to will be pre-approved by the DAO\n* Addresses to transfer to will be pre-approved\n* Tokens to transfer out of the Collector have a pre-defined budget set by the DAO\n\n## Future Phased Functionality Introduction\n\nThe following permissioned functionality is intended to be gradually introduced over time to further streamline the implementation of the DAO's financial transactions.\n\n* AAVE Protocol interactions in cross-chain deployments\n* Bridging from and to other chains\n\nSome of the above updates are pending other contracts to be delivered.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC] Renewal of Aave Guardian - 2024 \nDate: 2024-04-30\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n## Summary:\n\nThe Aave Guardians are a community-elected group with soft emergency protection permission on the Aave smart contracts. Periodically, the composition of this group undergoes renewals in which members may join, stay, or leave based on community votes. This process has occurred in the past, with the last renewal taking place in 2022. At present, it's time for another round of renewals to ensure the Aave Guardians continue to embody the evolving interests and needs of the Aave community.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Aave Guardians play a vital role in protecting the Aave Protocol. \n\nThis proposal aims to start a renewal of the aave guardian, allowing for the removal of members who wish to step down & the addition of new members more reflective of the Aave DAO's current active contributors.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal introduces 2 different Guardians, with a majority of non-common members on each one, and different roles.\n\n### Protocol emergency Guardian\n\nThis Guardian is the holder of `EMERGENCY_ADMIN` role in Aave v3, together with similar role in v2 and surrounding systems.\nGiven that speed is mandatory in an emergency situation, the members recommended are entities really active within the Aave DAO, for example service providers and delegates.\n\n*Its multi-sig configuration will be a 5-of-9.*\n\nMembers proposed (1 representative of each):\n\n- Chaos Labs (risk service provider).\n- Llamarisk (risk service provider).\n- Karpatkey (finance service provider).\n- Certora (security service provider).\n- Tokenlogic (finance service provider).\n- BGD Labs (development service provider).\n- ACI (growth and business development service provider).\n- Ezr3al (Aave DAO delegate).\n- Stable Labs (Aave DAO delegate).\n\n### Governance emergency Guardian\n\nThis other Guardian has an even less frequent role: cancel governance proposal whenever detected as malicious or containing mistakes (detected on the on-chain verification stage by Certora).\nThe rationale of being composed by different members than the Protocol emergency Guardian is that cancellation permissions whenever possible should be held by a different party than protocol-emergency ones. In addition, speed is not as critical as the Protocol emergency Guardian, given that Aave proposals happen during a period of 5 days, and problems can always be detected with enough time-margin.\n\n*Its multi-sig configuration will be a 5-of-9.*\n\nMembers proposed (1 representative of each):\n\n- ACI (growth and business development service provider). In both guardians for coordination/reach purposes.\n- Mounir (Paraswap)\n- Gavi Galloway (Standard Crypto)\n- Meltem Demirors (Coinshares)\n- Emilio (Avara)\n- Roger (Chainlink community)\n- Mariano Conti (DeFi OG)\n- Marin (Lido)\n- Certora (security service provider). In this governance given their role reviewing governance proposals.\n\n---\n\nA detailed view of permissions of the Aave Guardian on all Aave systems can be found [HERE](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-permissions-book).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Solicit/gather feedback from the Aave community.\n2. If community sentiment is favorable, proceed with the ARFC snapshot.\n3. if the ARFC snapshot vote outcome is YAE, Escalate to AIP stage for implementation.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI is not presenting this ARFC on behalf of any third party and is not compensated for creating this ARFC.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.

RLUSD intends to bridge TradFi with DeFi use cases, starting with its flagship payments products serving customers in over 70 markets. They aim to establish RLUSD as the de facto stablecoin for lending/borrowing, DeFi, repo, Treasury functions, payments, etc., all within the highest levels of compliance.\n\nOnboarding Ripple's RLUSD extends Aave Protocol's diverse stablecoin offerings to its users. RLUSD users on Aave Protocol may potentially benefit from future rewards programs. This introduction is expected to increase liquidity and engagement within the protocol.\n\nAligning with Aave DAO’s commitment to offering diversification across widely held and in-demand assets, onboarding RLUSD will enable users to leverage Ripple’s liquidity and reputation while benefiting from Aave’s established lending and borrowing functionalities. The initial slow launch of RLUSD is expected to benefit from a major integration like Aave Protocol and attract more mainstream users, contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform.\n\n## Specification- **Ticker**: RLUSD  \n- Contract addresses will be added during the ARFC stage once RLUSD is fully launched.  - Risk parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers as soon as possible, and the ARFC will be updated with that feedback\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Ripple and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate the proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, escalate the proposal to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publish a standard ARFC and collect community & service provider feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC Snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC Snapshot outcome is **YAE**, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",

AERO is ERC-20 utility token and can be used as the voting powers for the amount of emission rewards the pool receives each epoch by vote-escrow their tokens and receive a $veAERO\n\nThe Addition of AERO to Base V3 is diversifying listed assets and improve user experience. Furthermore, AERO earned from Pool can be used to boost GHO and/or aToken adoption and liquidity on Base as a strategic asset.\n\n## Specification \nTicker: AERO\nContract Adress: [0x940181a94A35A4569E4529A3CDfB74e38FD98631](https://basescan.org/address/0x940181a94A35A4569E4529A3CDfB74e38FD98631)\nChainlink Oracle: [0x4EC5970fC728C5f65ba413992CD5fF6FD70fcfF0](https://basescan.org/address/0x4EC5970fC728C5f65ba413992CD5fF6FD70fcfF0)\n\nProposed risk parameters will be shared at the potential ARFC stage of this proposal.\n\n## Reference\nProject: [https://aerodrome.finance/](https://aerodrome.finance/)\nGitHub:[https://github.com/aerodrome-finance](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance)\nDocs: [https://aerodrome.finance/docs](https://aerodrome.finance/docs)\nAudit*¹: [https://velodrome.finance/security](https://velodrome.finance/security)\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/aerodromefi](https://twitter.com/aerodromefi)\n\n*¹ Aerodrome Finance inherits the contract architecture and full security maintenance from Velodrome V2. Velodrome V2 has been audited and runs a bug-bounty program.\n\n## Next Step\n1. Gather community feedback on this TEMP CHECK.\n2. If consensus is reached, escalate this proposal to TEMP CHECK snapshot stage.\n3. If TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n4. If consensus on ARFC stage is reached and risk service providers provide feedback on risk parameters, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n5. If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage\n\n## Disclaimer\n0xlide is not presenting this TEMP CHECK on behalf of any third party and is not compensated by any entity for creating this TEMP CHECK.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
