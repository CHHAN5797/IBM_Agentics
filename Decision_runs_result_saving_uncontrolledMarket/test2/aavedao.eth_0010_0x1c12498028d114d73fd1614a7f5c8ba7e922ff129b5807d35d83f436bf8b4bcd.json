Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum & Arbitrum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their EVM wallet.\n\nThreshold Network has brought native minting of tBTC to Arbitrum, is live on GMX and has strong, sticky liquidity to support liquidations.\n\nFollowing its approval on AAVE V3 Ethereum, tBTC’s initial supply cap was reached within 72 hours, prompting an increase to meet the overwhelming demand and now sits at over 1,000 BTC TVL. This rapid adoption underscores the market’s appetite for trust-minimized BTC solutions in DeFi.\n\n## Benefits for Aave\n\n- High User Demand, since its initial deployment on Aave’s Ethereum market, tBTC reached its initial 500 BTC supply cap within the first week. The cap has been increased multiple times, now sitting at 2200 BTC, highlighting strong user interest. Something we hope to replicate on Arbitrum.\n- Easy, direct onboarding of BTC capital via Threshold’s Arbitrum native minting.\n- A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n- Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\n\nContract Address:\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\n> ARFC has been edited by ACI to reflect latest risk parameters provided by Risk Service Providers 2025-02-27\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | No |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap | 50 |\n| Borrow Cap | 25 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 73% |\n| LT | 78% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.5% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10% |\n| Variable Base | 0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300% |\n| Uoptimal | 45% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | No |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n\nUseful Links:\n\nProject: https://www.threshold.network/ \n\nMinting dashboard: [https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint](https://arbitrum.threshold.network/home?ref=blog.threshold.network)\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2 \n\nDocs: https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2 \n\nAudit: https://threshold.network/about#audits \n\nImmunfi Bug Bounty: https://immunefi.com/bounty/thresholdnetwork/ \n\nLlama Risk Report: [Collateral Risk Assessment: Threshold BTC (tBTC) - HackMD 4](https://hackmd.io/@LlamaRisk/tBTC)\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/thetnetwork \n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/threshold \n\nDune: https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc,  \nhttps://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity &\nhttps://dune.com/lrsaturnino/tbtc-on-arbitrum\n\n### What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nThreshold Network has no link and is not compensated to present this ARFC proposal.\n\n### Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token.\n\ntBTC is a decentralized wrapped Bitcoin that is 1:1 backed by native BTC. Unlike other wrapped Bitcoins, the BTC that backs tBTC is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography.\n\ntBTC is trust minimized and redeemable for native BTC without a centralized custodian. It can be used across the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\ntBTC can be used as collateral, liquidity, a store of value, and can be integrated with DeFi apps across all supported blockchains.\n\nAs with other BTC wrappers, tBTC provides cryptocurrency traders and general users with a BTC-pegged token, that can be used to generate yield whilst holding native BTC.\n\n### Explain the positioning of the token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nAdding support for tBTC on Aave v3 (Arbitrum) as an asset would allow tBTC holders to obtain a yield on their tBTC holdings.\n\ntBTC is the only way to permissionlessly borrow and lend BTC in a decentralized manner. This gives Aave direct access to the 1.7 trillion market  of BTC, for which centralised competitors provide limited access to. \n\n### Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are they live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n### How is tBTC currently used?\n\ntBTC is used across a variety of chains and use cases. Some key utlities include Aave, GMX, EigenLayer, Synthetix, Morpho, Symbiotic, collateral asset for crvUSD, thUSD and solvBTC.\n\nA comprehensible list can be found here:\n\n[https://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC 4](https://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC) & https://linktr.ee/earnyield \n\n### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n### Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance. In order for the wallet to move funds, it produces signatures using a Threshold Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, requiring 51-of-100 Signers to cooperate. The 100 signers on each wallet are chosen with our Sortition Pool, and the randomness is provided by the Random Beacon. More can be found here - [Wallet Generation | Threshold Docs 2](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/tbtc-v2/wallet-generation)\n\nThe Threshold Council multisig is a 6/9 Gnosis Safe multisig with 9 unique signers that form the Threshold Network Council. The Council has limited upgrade privileges over the smart contracts. However, those privileges do not include any custodial power over deposited BTC:\n\nCouncil Multisig Ethereum Address: 0x9F6e831c8F8939DC0C830C6e492e7cEf4f9C2F5f\n\n### Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nMarket capitalisation: $350m USD / 4,286 BTC\n\nDecentralized exchange liquidity pools: https://defillama.com/yields?token=TBTC \n\nDashboard on Decentralized LP liquidity: https://dune.com/sensecapital/tbtc-liquidity \n&\n\nhttps://dune.com/lrsaturnino/tbtc-on-arbitrum\n\n### Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nDiscord: 9,191\n\nTwitter: 37,900\n\nGithub: 4,596 commits\n\nContracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDate of Deployment: February 2023\n\nNumber of transactions: 74,721\n\nNumber of token holders: 1,665\n\n### Risk parameters\n\nWe suggest waiting for the feedback from risk teams for suggested parameters.\n\nSymbol: TBTC\n\nArbitrum Contract Address: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Threshold Network.

Users wishing to utilize their Bitcoin on Ethereum can use the tBTC decentralized bridge to deposit their Bitcoin into the system and get a minted tBTC token in their Ethereum wallet.\n\nHaving recently acquired a Chainlink oracle, tBTC enables Aave users to have access to the only wrapped Bitcoin, which can be permissionlessly minted and redeemed, where the BTC that backs it is not held by a central intermediary, but is instead held by a decentralized network of nodes using threshold cryptography. This implies a fully decentralized and permissionless lending and borrowing experience for BTC (i.e. bridge native BTC to tBTC and borrow via Aave).\n\ntBTC was created by a decentralized effort of contributors at the Threshold Network DAO, and extensively utilizes the Threshold Network’s threshold cryptography to create a secure BTC asset. tBTC is a product launched on Threshold Network, on which many other decentralized applications are being built.\n\nThreshold Network DAO was born out of the first on-chain merger between two decentralized protocols, Keep Network and NuCypher early in 2022. The DAO has successfully operated since that time, and supports an active community of contributors that work towards building tBTC liquidity and usability.\n\n### Benefits for Aave:\n\n- Further decentralization and trust minimisation in the Aave stack.\n- A range of lending options for those who wish to earn yield on their BTC.\n- Collaboration with the Threshold Network DAO, opening up the opportunity to incorporate other Threshold products (such as Threshold Access Control and thUSD) into the Aave offering.\n- Preferable yields on tBTC through active incentive participation, boosting Aave protocol use, fees and TVL.\n- Additional incentive allocation originating from Arbitrium’s LTIPP.\n\n## Specification\n\nTicker: TBTC\n\nContract Addresses:\n\nEthereum: 0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88\n\nArbitrum: 0x6c84a8f1c29108f47a79964b5fe888d4f4d0de40\n\nOptimism: 0x6c84a8f1c29108F47a79964b5Fe888D4f4D0dE40\n\nChainlink Oracle:\n\nEthereum: 0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297\n\nArbitrum: 0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C\n\nOptimism: 0x5a61374950D4BFa5a3D4f2CA36FC1d23A92b6f21\n\n### Risk parameters\n Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap (tBTC) | 550 |\n| Borrow Cap (tBTC) | 275 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 73.00% |\n| LT | 78.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 4.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n**CAPO**\n| Price Cap |\n| --- |\n| 4% |\n\n### Emission schedule\n\ntBTC is one-to-one backed with real Bitcoin, meaning that there isn’t an emissions schedule, but a mint and redeem function that adjusts the supply of tBTC based on native BTC coming into and out of the system.\n\n### Risks\n\nFor tBTC, wallets are created periodically based on governance.

With strong demand for ezETH on mainnet this proposal seeks to provide the opportunity for Aave users to make use of ezETH on leading Layer 2 networks: Base and Arbitrum.\n\nThe onboarding of ezETH on these L2s will create increased ezETH demand and increased revenues for both Aave and Renzo Protocol, whilst also bolstering the liquidity and peg stability of ezETH.\n\nChain to be deployed/listed\nAave v3 instances on Base and Arbitrum.\n\nProof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments\nezETH deposits and wstETH borrows will be incentivized with Renzo Points.\n\nSpecification\nezETH contracts:\n\nArbitrum: 0x2416092f143378750bb29b79eD961ab195CcEea5\n\nBase: 0x2416092f143378750bb29b79ed961ab195cceea5\n\nRisk Parameters:\nThese will be provided by risk service providers and this ARFC updated with parameters accordingly.\n\nARFC updated with Risk Parameters by Risk Service Providers. 2024-10-31\n\nParameter\tValue\nChain\tArbitrum\nIsolation Mode\tNo\nBorrowable\tYes\nCollateral Enabled\tYes\nSupply Cap\t1,750\nBorrow Cap\t175\nDebt Ceiling\t-\nLTV\t72%\nLT\t75%\nLiquidation Penalty\t7.5%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\t10.00%\nVariable Base\t0.0%\nVariable Slope1\t7.00%\nVariable Slope2\t300.00%\nUoptimal\t45.00%\nReserve Factor\t15.00%\nStable Borrowing\tDisabled\nFlashloanable\tYes\nSiloed Borrowing\tNo\nBorrowable in Isolation\tNo\nE-Mode Category\tETH-correlated, ezETH/wstETH\nParameter\tValue\nChain\tBase\nIsolation Mode\tNo\nBorrowable\tYes\nCollateral Enabled\tYes\nSupply Cap\t1,200\nBorrow Cap\t120\nDebt Ceiling\t-\nLTV\t72%\nLT\t75%\nLiquidation Penalty\t7.5%\nLiquidation Protocol Fee\t10.00%\nVariable Base\t0.0%\nVariable Slope1\t7.00%\nVariable Slope2\t300.00%\nUoptimal\t45.00%\nReserve Factor\t15.00%\nStable Borrowing\tDisabled\nFlashloanable\tYes\nSiloed Borrowing\tNo\nBorrowable in Isolation\tNo\nE-Mode Category\tETH-correlated, ezETH/wstETH\nCAPO\nFollowing the analysis in this post, we recommend using a 14-day MINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY and a maxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent of 10.89%.\n\n\nmaxYearlyRatioGrowthPercent\tratioReferenceTime\tMINIMUM_SNAPSHOT_DELAY\n10.89%\tmonthly\t14 days\nUseful Links\nRenzo Protocol\n\nDocumentation\n\nGithub\n\nAudits\n\nChainlink Data Feed\n\nComposable Stable Pool\n\nTEMP CHECK for onboarding on Ethereum Instance\n\nTEMP CHECK Snapshot for onboarding on Ethereum Instance\n\nARFC for onboarding on Lido Instance\n\nARFC Snapshot for onboarding on Lido Instance\n\nDisclaimer\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

Adding AAVE to the Base instance is the next logical step in AAVE token integration within the AAVE lending platform. \n\n## Motivation\n\n* AAVE token is a versatile governance token which is already accepted collateral on all major AAVE instances.\n\n-The Base Market is growing in TVL, the addition of collateral options already found on other AAVE instances will increase Base Market growth. \n-There is deep liquidity on Base chain for the AAVE token already. Price impact of just **0.77%** for $1m ETH/AAVE trades using jumper.exchange on Base.\n-Aerodrome (Base DEX) has $10m TVL in WETH/AAVE concentrated liquidity.\n![34039cc1bf8502f76660a4128e8162cb.png](ipfs://bafkreiclmjg4tyndj5gnyr522mkqdxxtaicqtmcntn4vtlnfhghjo3f45i)\n\n![eaadd7e857120a1d552e4270081c9d3f.png](ipfs://bafkreic4fhcydkhxqeeppoq4ahujw3l2dcri7hxfiqq2wfj4rezbi4aixq)\n\nBase has seen expansion in its TVL now surpassing Arbitrum by ~15%.

The token allows users to participate in the staking rewards while maintaining the flexibility to use their staked assets within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nOnboarding slisBNB will allow Aave users to utilize it as collateral, thus broadening the asset base and enhancing overall liquidity.\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments\n\nUsers who supply slisBNB liquidity on Aave, will be eligible to get stardust (points) from Lista's ongoing point system Cosmic Adventure Challenge Season 3, which will turn to LISTA token airdrop when Season 3 ends.\n\n### Specification\n\nToken Name: slisBNB\n\nUnderlying Asset: Staked BNB\n\nContract: 0xB0b84D294e0C75A6abe60171b70edEb2EFd14A1B\n\n> Risk Parameters and analysis have been provided by Risk Service Providers so ARFC has been be updated accordingly.\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Isolation Mode|No|\n|Borrowable|Yes|\n|Borrowable in Isolation|No|\n|Collateral Enabled|Yes|\n|E-Mode Category|None|\n|Supply Cap|20,000|\n|Borrow Cap|2,000|\n|Debt Ceiling|-|\n|LTV|55%|\n|LT|60%|\n|Liquidation Bonus|7.50%|\n|Liquidation Protocol Fee|10.00%|\n|Variable Base|0.0%|\n|Variable Slope1|7.00%|\n|Variable Slope2|300.00%|\n|Uoptimal|45.00%|\n|Reserve Factor|15.00%|\n|Stable Borrowing|Disabled|\n|Flashloanable|Yes|\n|Siloed Borrowing|No|\n\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\nhttps://lista.org/\n\nhttps://lista.org/liquid-staking/BNB\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. ACI is not directly affiliated with Lista DAO and did not receive compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
