However, it also brings limitations, especially considering the existence of many non-EVM blockchains that offer different advantages such as lower transaction fees, higher throughput, and more advanced consensus mechanisms. In addition to purely technical advantages, many non-EVM blockchains can allow the Aave community to expand to an entirely new ecosystem, previously inaccessible user groups, and introduce new product possibilities.\n\nAptos is a blockchain designed for building scalable and secure dApps. Developed by former leaders of Meta's Diem blockchain project, it aims to address some of the limitations in existing blockchain systems such as throughput, scalability, and security. With a TVL of approximately $350m and growing rapidly, Aptos is the 17th largest chain by TVL (source: [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/Aptos)). Its robust infrastructure offers high transaction throughput, low, predictable fees, and advanced security through the [Move programming language](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/why-move), that make Aptos an ideal platform for DeFi applications. The chain has a diverse array of [DeFi](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/projects/defi) offerings, including prominent projects like Thala, Aries Markets, Amnis Finance, Econia, alongside primarily EVM-native projects such as Sushiswap and Pancake Swap. Aptos Labs Founders Mo Shaikh and Avery Ching have leveraged their extensive experience at Meta to propel Aptos towards becoming a leader in scalable and secure blockchain solutions. Moreover, Aptos has established high-profile partnerships with industry giants like Google Cloud, Microsoft, SK Telecom and many more others, further enhancing its technological capabilities and broadening its influence.\n\n*Advantages of Aptos*\n\nAptos offers several significant advantages that make it an ideal platform for high-demand applications. With its ability to handle over [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), it excels in supporting DeFi, real-time financial services, gaming, AI and other use cases. The platform's agile governance allows for rapid upgrades and swift implementation of new features. Additionally, Aptos ensures low and predictable fees through a stable fee model, and its use of the Move programming language enhances security with formal verification and resource-oriented programming. Built-in security features and automated auditing tools streamline the security process, while advanced state management techniques optimize data storage and access. Furthermore, Aptos simplifies integration with other blockchains through built-in interoperability, creating a cohesive and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Aptos represents a groundbreaking expansion as it marks Aave’s first deployment on a non-EVM blockchain. This strategic move is significant as it opens up new technological frontiers, diversifies Aave’s ecosystem, and underscores its commitment to innovation.\n\nBy leveraging Aptos’ innovative technology and developer community, Aave can address diverse financial needs, attract new users, and drive greater innovation in the DeFi sector. This deployment aligns with the Aave community’s strategic goal to explore new technological possibilities and tap into a wider pool of talent and resources.\n\nKey benefits of deploying Aave V3 on Aptos include:\n\n1. First Non-EVM Deployment:\n\n  * This deployment is a significant milestone as Aave’s first move beyond EVM-compatible blockchains. It positions Aave to explore and integrate with new blockchain ecosystems, enhancing its resilience and broadening its reach.\n\n2. Early Mover Advantage and Strong Brand:\n\n  * Aave is a leading brand in the DeFi space, with a strong reputation and market share. By deploying on Aptos, Aave captures early mover advantages on a high-performance blockchain, similar to its strategic expansions to Polygon and other L2s. This can attract both seasoned DeFi users and new participants exploring Aptos.\n\n3. Aptos' Strategic Position:\n\n  * The Aptos team, with their background from Meta's Diem project, has strong connections and expertise in finance, social and gaming sectors. Integrating Aave into Aptos complements these areas by adding a mature financial layer, essential for a complete blockchain ecosystem.\n\n4. High Transaction Throughput:\n\n  * Aptos supports up to [30,000 transactions per second (TPS)](https://aptoslabs.medium.com/previewnet-ensuring-scalability-and-reliability-of-the-aptos-network-48f0d210e8fe), crucial for DeFi protocols like Aave that handle a high volume of transactions, including loans, repayments, and interest accruals. This high throughput can significantly enhance user experience and enable new use cases that require high-frequency transactions.\n\n5. Enhanced Security with Move Language:\n\n  * Aave v3 introduces sophisticated risk management tools and improved security protocols. The Move programming language used by Aptos has inherent security advantages, such as preventing reentrancy attacks. This alignment can lead to a more secure DeFi lending environment, leveraging Move's safety features and formal verification.\n\n6. Transaction Cost Efficiency:\n\n  * Aave v3 focuses on gas efficiency, critical for reducing transaction costs. Aptos' efficient processing capabilities further complement this by potentially lowering transaction fees even more. This makes Aave more accessible and attractive to a broader range of users, from retail participants to institutional players.\n\n7. Modular and Flexible Architecture:\n\n  * Aave v3's modular and flexible architecture facilitates easier upgrades and expansions. Aptos supports upgradable smart contracts and a flexible account model, enhancing this aspect. This allows for seamless implementation of updates and improvements without significant disruptions or migrations.\n\n8. Economic Benefits for the Aave DAO:\n\n  * Market Share Growth: Access to new markets and user bases, specifically in APAC and Korea where Aptos has a strong presence.\n  * Revenue Growth: New markets and user bases can significantly increase transaction volumes and generate additional revenue streams.\n  * Incentives: Aptos Foundation has committed to provide up to 2M APT in liquidity mining incentives and rewards depending on performance in order to attract users and liquidity providers, increase adoption and boost the ecosystem’s growth. Aptos Foundation will work closely with Chaos Labs on determining the appropriate level of incentives relative to caps set.\n\nThe Move implementation on-going development code of Aave Protocol V3 can be found [here](https://github.com/aave/aptos-aave-v3).\n\nThe Aptos team is currently working with Aave Labs, Zellic, SpearBit and later in time with Certora and OtterSec on security reviews and improvements to the codebase to achieve high security standards. Aptos is sponsoring the audits.\n\n### ChainLink Integration:\n\nWe plan to integrate with ChainLink’s Price Feeds as the oracle provider for the market (currently in development), and with the recently [announced](https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/aptos-network-chainlink-data-feeds) Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enhance the functionality and security of Aave on Aptos.\n\nAsset and parameter settings would be discussed during ARFC.\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal published by the Aptos Foundation is intended for community feedback and does not represent a final decision. The deployment of Aave V3 on Aptos is subject to successful completion of all technical reviews, audits, and governance approvals. Aave Labs has built substantial expertise in the Move programming language and is prepared to proceed with the deployment pending community approval and further development steps.

        "author": "0x2cc1ADE245020FC5AAE66Ad443e1F66e01c54Df1",
        "body": "![Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 11.49.57](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rytN7ZMH6.png)\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication introduces @TokenLogic and @Karpatkey as the DAO’s Financial Service Provider for an initial period of 180 days, with a proposed budget of 400k GHO. The scope of contribution will span the following areas of the DAO’s finances:\n\n* Treasury Management;\n* Strategic Assets’ Liquidity; and\n* Safety Module.\n\nThe combined karpatkey and TokenLogic team presents an unparalleled offering of specialized skills and proven technical expertise, with a network that spans most of DeFi.\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Treasury Management\n\nAave is the leading cross-chain lending protocol by all relevant KPIs i.e. TVL, supplied; and borrowed assets. With the latest version (v3) present on 10 networks, Aave Protocol currently generates revenue across ten networks and 18 deployments (v1, v2 incl. Centrifuge and ARC, v3 incl. Spark), consolidating a cross-chain treasury that’s currently worth around $130M.\n\n![|576x335](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/63TVEW32fnDI7_Dg3E5Mzw1XnQJd8284sa4VJ_XfrFWfVLsiEH4lX134c-X5StL4qo7L5QZOQaId-a8MQURHy2Ml3eeDfuSe8DdXRwDF-wK9cMJm26NLZjw9Ys6PZRYCT3YeUl7m49HJo_5C_tt9NeI \"Chart\")\n\nIn spite of having a significantly sized treasury, the Aave DAO faces mainly three challenges with its current treasury composition and operational practice.\n\n### Portfolio Volatility\n\nA significant portion of the treasury is held in the DAO’s native token (AAVE) which currently has limited DeFi utility and introduces volatility in the overall treasury value. The following chart illustrates the treasury allocation across various crypto assets.\n\n![|522x304](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MAvZlV6jGMF6UfYcfO54H761nqHULxFYABWN0b-et8UjKGF1T9ZhzphJZqwlT6r8RcvQ2q9ovKLmLddvKRSiwwUhsAtlFoYpJCimdbzf6bUI0JkRsxkfed0HGSfwvh646x_mVaJlLVIA1Lc9ZltgwKA \"Chart\")\n\n### Asset Dispersion\n\nTreasury funds are dispersed around multiple collector contracts deployed in different blockchains. These funds are a direct result of how the protocol captures value and are mostly denominated in aTokens (~61) according to market activity, which requires constant rebalancing to meet expense requirements. This activity has historically been carried out through the governance processes, lacking comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio composition and rationale for asset allocation.![|688x384](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/TOGbL74wUrt6nMH83_jLP5kdJMQqX0Bnm4F0Qy3b605oaEz6z0xO1A3qw8ysj1hZdjzqm8MlSLP8hlesdTy3CegW3JEErznwfRdUX1YzgJS2ni8Cdb0btuuJE35VvcQi1KJVMB-Z3w7bVaSGVtlvn7U)\n\nThe DAO has only recently gained the ability to move funds between Polygon and Ethereum, while all other Treasuries are isolated, often leading to missed opportunities for leveraging the DAO’s funds. These opportunities are crucial for enhancing and capitalizing on synergies within the Aave ecosystem, including GHO management and the Safety Module.\n\n### Runway\n\nAccording to the latest [forecasted expenses](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/), the DAO’s 12-month budget is over $19M.\n\n|Category|Budget $k|Duration (mths)|Annualized Budget|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Security¹|$1,500|6|$3,000|\n|[Risk Management](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194/8)|$1,600|12|$1,600|\n|Bug Bounty|$1,000|12|$1,000|\n|Gov.

Certora only.\n2. AGD figures based on discussions with the team.\n\nWhile there are ongoing plans to secure part of this amount of stablecoins, most of it is allocated in high utilization Aave lending markets. Although reckoning the strategic rationale, holding most of the assets in the DAO’s own protocol exposes the portfolio to excessive risk in a volatility event scenario e.g. exploit.\n\n![|669x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Aq6xqeeq_hr2ObgV9PFBiQrn6BFRk718dJywySHO4U7jRyUXSsMDyl7CdMhdf1cGOht1143KdBZy4mEagWkrum9CBeapl2HnDnSFfRbFNaPB4-3pZH0veEu8nMoo2cAw3-uohJYNq8s8zKUn-J45spg \"Chart\")\n\nWith the aim to support the protocol’s self-sustainability, treasury management should aim to reduce long tail asset exposure, ensure a 12-month financial runway and a stablecoins allocation that balances servicing Aave users and the DAO’s capital preservation.\n\n## GHO Development\n\nAave developed [GHO](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/overview) as a stablecoin native to the ecosystem and controlled by Aave Governance that enables a new level of transparency and censorship resistance. Technically, [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f#readContract) is a collateral-backed stablecoin minted by users who lock up collateral assets in Aave's v3 protocol. The protocol uses smart contracts to manage the issuance and burning of the token through allow-listed entities called [Facilitators](https://docs.gho.xyz/concepts/how-gho-works/gho-facilitators), whose capacity to mint GHO (bucket) is enabled by Aave’s governance.\n\nAiming to enable committed AAVE token holders to capture additional value, GHO’s [debt strategy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) introduces an innovative concept of [rate discount](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4C38Ec4D1D2068540DfC11DFa4de41F733DDF812#readContract) by staking AAVE.\n\nWith an [on-chain vote executed in July](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/aave/proposal/268?chart=0), Aave launched GHO with two Facilitators (Aave itself and GHO FlashMinter), a borrowing rate of 1.5%, and a discount rate of 30% for AAVE stakers. Since then, the borrowing rate has been [increased to 4.72%](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x9789e054e29f63da5713368be2dd0b4006f4564ef5e48c9d5e994ec20e932e35).\n\n![|690x391](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7UXzX05dWaMixQmE4B-lkjHuv4-fu2jIFs8bn03_gLYG8hjpIm2mPHK4uhWVcyetMgZPUlWekoavWr1pfc43F15YuXkIZPy1r1K71mtU6WxdBl4rdzw4zMiABAUsHgRDP4d-BdkW_E-EcFgA1qArif0)\n\n![|691x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qdTC5Jy9o8-ciz62oGpAZDGq2KOMK7V2h1S8PL-G6oawfXSJMz02eQSaeIofbcvmatQBOGogKZSyVDeLZCHpbSLDRsiCATHipR5EGO0lzc4jwoaiB3VpInOtUgiypK9UTy6mIflJpvlS6yaAmcn4pHE)\n\nAs demonstrated by GHO’s price chart, the most immediate challenge the Aave community is facing is the persistent trading of GHO at a discount practically since deployment. This trend has been influenced by higher stablecoin-enabled market rates like MakerDAO's Dai Savings Rate (DSR), creating a rate arbitrage opportunity. This cycle of borrowing and selling GHO harms GHO holders as it generates selling pressure, leading to a loss of value and eroding trust in GHO's stability. It also encourages a speculative pattern among GHO minters motivated to borrow and dump the asset, followed by repurchasing at a lower price, further driving down its value.\n\nFor the long-term health and success of GHO, two more enduring aspects require the community’s attention:\n\n### Peg Mechanisms\n\nThere's a crucial need for robust peg mechanisms tailored specifically for GHO that go beyond tactical borrow rate adjustments. Such mechanisms should be designed to help maintain GHO's value relative to its peg, irrespective of broader market movements or temporary arbitrage opportunities. Effective peg maintenance strategies will provide the dual benefits of protecting GHO's value in turbulent market conditions and reinforcing its utility as a stable and reliable medium of exchange within the DeFi ecosystem, thus addressing the core issue of price stability head-on.\n\n### Demand\n\nThe second one is generating organic demand that leads to an increased supply, mainly demand vectors external to the platform, but also including growth rooted in value-generating activities within the DeFi ecosystem. Without these value-generating flows, GHO faces the risk of remaining underutilized, hampering both its adoption and functionality as a stablecoin meant to facilitate economic activity.\n\n![|654x345](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0K9JhuF5N6ScUkxYuGisZNp4S0IQ0qfc1ZvnW59aTIzisXhXB-4w5PX_2pzyTKs9sOlZkPikzm2IPx-uC_B366JsFOyHrmVqFYdLfmef0fBEaXquwkH-f48RAzVfmM9AqARhdcJ_EIQn7IrxaMv2fU0)\n\nCurrently, external demand for GHO has predominantly centered around its exchange for USD tokens and liquidity provision. While providing liquidity has been the sole avenue for yield generation, there has been a noticeable decrease in the allocated GHO liquidity recently.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) provides the DAO with an insurance-like fund expected to repay users of lost funds resulting from Aave’s smart contract exposure. The current composition of the insurance fund is overweight AAVE to the point where there exists a negative feedback loop between potential Bad Debt exposure and the AAVE token price.\n\n![|657x294](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Haaciw-Es4QZS2QZBueQ1g1ar-L_e_Lp6MRd1neEqlzndAy5gha5PLUtYYo1QKy_k80ZGSP-cEGf-rVYbRrqZ3L0W_m6kcN3EZBcW2ciXFr5FZnQR-jPlKBHKgzQ20dOmlAVksGqlflbCk-At3Uq4d4)\n\nIf a Short Fall event was to occur, speculators could frontrun the AAVE auction, potentially even trigger liquidations on Aave Protocol, and cause the auction to occur at a lower than otherwise AAVE price. This unintentional feedback loop can be partially mitigated by modifying the safety module fund with the introduction of additional assets over time.\n\nFurthermore, the previously outlined negative feedback loop involving AAVE's price, liquidations, and bad debt results in a high cost for utilizing AAVE tokens. Consequently, it is necessary to reevaluate the incentivization of liquidity in the Safety Module, aiming for a more efficient allocation of DAO funds.\n\n![|693x410](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/675CMMvT7wcInW2NSWdJ11ByiOKa-aC627ziLQQ_WSVR_nRljGEgKdaxRZbS5RRiAQ5MSVuYC-_Vu2_5fSiWBLtmxBuENsf2GJnBVqkOnTdgH4BabaF680wEQkHSWK2OxkO87lQs9ncUOhb8yQEcyPk)\n\nThe daily cost of sustaining the SM is estimated to be approximately 100k USD per day at the prevailing AAVE distribution rate and market price. If all the AAVE and B-80AAVE-20wETH can be auctioned off at spot prices, the insurance funds coverage ranges from 1.7% to 3.2% of TVL over the last 18 months. For each $1 of coverage provided, the Aave DAO is paying approximately 31 cents each year. With a reduction in AAVE rewards, as proposed [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936), the costs of sustaining the insurance fund will be reduced.\n\n## Why Partnering?\n\nAll of the topics mentioned above are deeply connected. Most of the assets contained in the treasury derive their value partly from their liquidity and the protocol’s security; the Safety Module’s effectiveness relies on attracting external capital through LP incentives; and GHO’s peg mechanism is dependant on liquidity, which could be incentivized using the treasury’s holdings.\n\nThere hasn’t been a holistic approach to these core activities of Aave DAO’s financials so far, which ultimately has led to [uncoordinated](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061/11?u=karpatkey) and inefficient decision-making processes.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are partnering to provide Aave DAO with a comprehensive financial service solution. This partnership leverages:\n\n* Over three years of experience in advancing the Aave Protocol through a pivotal role in feature development and product adoption; and\n* A distinguished history of contributing to the most respected DAOs in the industry through specialized financial services.\n\nThe combined expertise of our teams is deeply rooted in the Aave ecosystem and extends across its community.\n\n### TokenLogic\n\nWe are a proactive team that puts our partners' needs first. Our developers are already actively contributing to the Aave Protocol, 23 AIPs to date. We believe in Aave’s incremental improvement process and building solutions that enable the DAO to manage its finances efficiently whilst minimizing external dependencies.\n\nOur dedication was demonstrated when we presented a proposal to improve the Aave DAO’s runway and built a preliminary frontend for the community. Our analysis will continue to showcase the interactive and transparent theme of the GHO Analytics platform. The refined scope primarily focuses on Treasury Management, GHO Liquidity/adoption and the Safety Module.\n\n### karpatkey\n\nkarpatkey is a DeFi-native organization specializing in professional DAO finance through industry-leading research and tooling since 2020. We’ve been working with [GnosisDAO](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkeys-weekly-report-on-gnosisdao-farms/6219), [Balancer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/karpatkey-s-weekly-report-on-balancerdao-farms/4386), [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-weekly-reports/16665), [CoW Protocol](https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624https://forum.cow.fi/t/cow-treasury-report-for-march-2023/1624), and [Lido](https://snapshot.org/#/lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0xac31f800288c68e32d1eb3cea7a525022faae3eb3bf805d1b3d248cda5375a13) on financial planning, operations, and strategy, diversifying their treasuries into sustainable portfolios of DeFi investments designed to support DAOs in executing their missions. Check out our [values](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-values) to understand a bit more about our guiding and decision-making principles.\n\nAs DAO treasury developers, we contributed to some of the most reputable DeFi protocols in our industry. We supported the adoption of xDAI across Gnosis Chain, [paving the way](https://x.com/GnosisDAO/status/1673343419232526340) for the deployment of sDAI that [boosted chain TVL](https://x.com/DLNewsInfo/status/1714990022598787118) and consolidated a stablecoin hub with the integrations like Angle and Spark. Our extensive experience provided us with advanced practical knowledge on DeFi primitives like stableswap and concentrated liquidity AMMs, liquidity, and voting incentives, veTokenomics, leverage and lending platforms, and integrations with top protocols.\n\nIn addition to being an active [Aave delegate](https://governance.aave.com/t/karpatkey-delegate-platform/14417) with more than 90 governance votes since August 7th, we’ve contributed to the [development of an Aave fork](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/karpatkey-2022-year-in-review-for-gnosis/6431#lending-protocols-5) project and historically deployed, borrowed, and staked a combined $26.51M worth of LP positions in both Aave V2 and V3.\n\nWe now believe we can meaningfully contribute to solidifying Aave’s position as the leading DeFi lending protocol, not only through domain expertise but mostly through pushing positive-sum initiatives with the DAOs we work with.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal outlines a collaborative framework between TokenLogic and karpatkey to manage the Aave DAO's treasury. Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n## Architecture for Asset Management Tooling\n\nWe aim to define and implement a robust architecture for asset management. At a high level, this architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s \"shortExecutor\". All designs will be aligned with Aave best practices, and will encompass required steps to update existing infrastructure (e.g. SAM).\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n## Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO's known budget and anticipated expenses as shared above. This approach guarantees financial stability and an operational continuity for Aave DAO.\n\nKey components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds from other blockchains to consolidate them in Ethereum;\n* Migrating primary stablecoin funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3 for improved experience in using aTokens as payments; and\n* Swapping secondary stablecoins in mainnet prioritizing GHO.\n\nDo note, Financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\nAs it currently stands, all necessary preparation for incorporating financial statements as part of the earlier TokenLogic proposal has been paused due to overall Aave budget considerations.\n\n## Formation of the Aave Liquidity Committee\n\nThis expanded committee will oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO's price movement towards re-pegging, while maintaining its utility across a full range AMMs.\n  * Utilize Maverick's design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n  * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n  * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n  * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility on their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave's AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token's value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n  * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n  * Enhance GHO's extrinsic demand by incentivizing stableswap pools, such as Balancer's GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n  * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer's architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO's price stability.\n  * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n  * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it in",

        "body": "## [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave on Rootstock Network\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2025-01-07\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check advocates the deployment of Aave on the Rootstock network, the longest-standing and battle-tested EVM-compatible Bitcoin L2, by providing general background information to gauge the community's interest in the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Rootstock.\n\nThis deployment proposal is an opportunity to tap into the growing interest in Bitcoin-based DeFi and unlock the vast potential of the Bitcoin market cap by expanding BTC utility via Aave's protocol. This would be possible through Rootstock's native token, RBTC, which is a 1:1 BTC-pegged asset redeemable for BTC via a secure and trust-minimized two-way-peg. As a Proof-of-Work chain [secured by more than 60% of Bitcoin's hash power](https://stats.rootstock.io/) through a merged-mining mechanism, Rootstock ensures a safe network for those users who aim to leverage their BTC but do not want to lack Bitcoin security.\n\nThe proposal outlines a comprehensive liquidity bootstrapping and incentives distribution strategy to ensure the success of deploying Aave on Rootstock. This includes an initial liquidity injection commitment of 500 RBTC in collaboration with RootstockLabs and ecosystem partners and a $750,000 incentives program. Rootstrock is also willing to integrate the GHO stablecoin in its ecosystem providing rate predictability for users.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRootstock, the first and most secured Bitcoin Layer, aims to enhance Bitcoin's functionality by allowing smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. It is the first EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain and uses merged mining consensus for enhanced security and scalability. Rootstock has secured over 60% of the total Bitcoin hashrate, meaning that more than 60% of Bitcoin miners are securing the Rootstock network using the same hardware and energy input.\n\nThe permissionless network has experienced significant growth in 2024 in all major metrics. This can be attributed partially to Rootstock's onboarding and partnership with major protocols such as Sushi and Uniswap. Liquidity's strong proliferation demonstrates the growing demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi applications.\n\nRootstock employs a unique bridging system called Powpeg to enable the secure transfer of BTC into the Rootstock network as RBTC, and vice versa. This system is managed by specialized nodes known as Powpeg functionaries, which include entities like BlockVenture, Luxor, pNetwork, Collider, RootstockLabs, and Xapo.  Rootstock's [public roadmap](https://rootstock.io/roadmap/) includes several technical upgrades to improve speed, security, and functionality. This innovative roadmap led by Sergio Lerner, RootstockLabs’ Chief Scientist and Co-Founder, also selected as one of 50 people influential in Crypto in 2024 by [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2024/12/05/most-influential-2024), has been implementing several upgrades such as the development of [BitVMX](https://bitvmx.org/), a trust-minimized bridge between the Bitcoin mainchain and Rootstock sidechain.\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Rootstock offers a strategic advantage by capitalizing on the growing demand for DeFi applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The increasing usage of wrapped Bitcoin on EVM chains serves as a proxy for this latent demand, indicating a desire to utilize Bitcoin-based collateral in DeFi protocols. Rootstock addresses this demand by providing a more decentralized and self-custodial alternative through its native token RBTC, and its underlying infrastructure.\n\n### **Reasons for Integration:**\n\n- **Access the Bitcoin-based DeFi through a battle-tested Bitcoin L2:** It has a large ecosystem with 170+ dApps and protocols deployed and a growing TVL. With the growing demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi, Rootstock is well-positioned to capitalize on this market as it is the network with real utility and use cases. Its canonical deployment on Uniswap V3, which got over 40 million votes, demonstrated the rising demand and interest in Rootstock. The combination of Rootstock’s features with a widely used protocol is the key to a win-win integration. Strategic integrations with Top tier dApps like Uniswap v3 on Oku, Sushi, Algebra DEXs, Solv Finance, Money on Chain, Symbiosis, Pell Network make Rootstock leading the DeFi ecosystem in the Bitcoin L2 space.\n- **Advanced Infrastructure :** Rootstock is the most advanced and complete infrastructure ecosystem in the Bitcoin Layer 2 space with Oracles, Indexers, and Developers tools, including Chainlink (Price feeds and CCIP integration by January/February), Redstone Finance, Alchemy, Gelato, The Graph, Goldsky, Bware Labs.\n- **RBTC, as a Bitcoin-asset collateral:** Rootstock uses RBTC (bridged version of Bitcoin) for transaction fees, avoiding the need for a separate native token. The Powpeg system handles the transfer of value between Bitcoin and Rootstock, minting and burning RBTC as required. This makes it an ideal collateral for DeFi lending and borrowing. By deploying Aave on Rootstock, Aave can enable users to use RBTC as collateral for loans, which will address demand and diversify options for Bitcoin-backed assets. Rootstock has this ambitious plan to expand RBTC to other chains. RBTC enables the most decentralized, secure, seamless, omnichain access to Bitcoin for DeFi use cases, allowing users to retain Bitcoin's core properties.\n- **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Rootstock has been investing in core-infrastructure partnerships, which facilitate the flow of assets between several networks. In the past months, it has announced several Top-tier partnerships like LayerZero, Stargate, LiFi, Jumper Exchange, Symbiosis, ChainPort, Rubic. No other BTC L2 can offer Rootstock trajectory and assets deployed by Stargate.\n- **GHO Integrated with the Ecosystem:** Rootstock will integrate and support the GHO stablecoin as a key USD stablecoin. By integrating GHO, Rootstock will unlock new opportunities for users to leverage the value of their Bitcoin holdings with rate predictability for users. RootstockLabs plans to bootstrap GHO liquidity in Rootstock's DEXs like Uniswap and Sushi, and also foster users' adoption by distributing incentives in GHO pools.\n- **Access to Institutions liquidity: RootstockLabs is already actively collaborating with institutional partners to attract and secure institutional capital across the network. Those institutions already showed their interest to use Aave for lending against Bitcoin and this deployment will be strategic to address capital allocation from institutional partners like Crypto banks, Hedge Funds, Liquid Funds and miners.**\n\nThis active collaboration with institutional investors aims to attract extra deposit commitments to ensure liquidity diversification and high adoption of Aave in Rootstock. Rootstock is able to address institutional demand in the Bitcoin Layer space because it is integrated with Fireblocks and Utila, which ensures access to Rootstock and its ecosystem. In 2025, RootstockLabs team is working to expand institutional-grade partnerships to be consolidated also as the most advanced infrastructure for institutional investors.\n\n## **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nRecognizing the monumental opportunity to unlock and capture an emerging market in the Bitcoin-based DeFi ecosystem, this proposal outlines a robust liquidity and incentive strategy designed to attract and retain users on Rootstock.\n\n- **Proof of Liquidity: To ensure a strong start for Aave on Rootstock, RootstockLabs, the core contributor to Rootstock, along with ecosystem and institutional partners, will commit a substantial amount of liquidity to Aave's pools.**\n    - **Liquidity Bootstrapping of 500 BTC (approximately $50 million USD).**\n- **Incentives Distribution: RootstockLabs has partnered with IntoTheBlock to design and develop a liquidity bootstrap plan across the network through incentives distribution, this plan includes Aave.

        "body": "Title: [TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on Linea Testnet\n\n@fig – Flipside Crypto & @DAOstrat.C - Consensys / Linea\n\nDate: 06-23-2023\n\nContact:\n\nGovernance@Consensys.net\n\n-----\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check seeks the community’s input on the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Linea Testnet and move to Mainnet right after all pre-conditions and dependencies are met on Linea Mainnet. Linea seeks to support Aave’s multichain future while establishing Aave as a leading market on a promising zkEVM with a robust distribution network.\n\n## Background\n\n### About Linea\n\nLinea is a scalable L2 on top of Ethereum powered by a zkEVM tech stack incubated by Consensys, resulting from over 20 months of R&D from Consensys's research team. This team has a track record of successful projects in the zk space, including the GNARK library and active involvement in the Merge. Moreover, Linea is well-connected with developers in the broader ecosystem through existing relationships with MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle. The tech stack that powers Linea aims to support a wide ecosystem extending Ethereum Mainnet capabilities. It intends to align its onboarding and distribution with these products to serve developers, protocols, and builders better.\n\nLinea aims to become a Type 2 zkEVM and achieve EVM-equivalence, processing native EVM bytecode for proving and verification. This approach allows for the execution of Solidity smart contracts without needing modifications or re-audit and compatibility at the RPC level with widely adopted middleware and toolsets, providing developers with a familiar environment to build using well-established tools and infrastructure. Linea’s technical value proposition includes the following:\n\n1. ***EVM Equivalence*** - The network avoids transpilers or custom compilers on bytecode, meaning the Ethereum L1 solidity code requires no modification. This significantly reduces deployment costs (no need to re-audit the code) and the risk of bugs and hacks by taking the compiled bytecode directly from Solidity.\n\n2. ***Commitment to Decentralization*** - The Linea team has publicly discussed their intent to decentralize the network within the first 12 months of operation. This includes a state-of-the-art decentralized prover and sequencer structure. Research into these topics is currently underway at Consensys.\n\n3. ***Continual strive for innovation*** - Our priority is pushing the boundaries of the Web3 space while maintaining the highest security and full EVM compatibility. Notably, Linea fully supports EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction), and, in collaboration with key stakeholders, the network already utilizes a single-entry-point contract and hosts top-tier bundlers and paymasters services. Much effort will also be provided to foster human-driven activity by incentivizing projects that leverage attestations and identity ownership.\n\nLinea’s testnet has handled over 2 million transactions under private beta and over 33 million transactions under public beta. Many of these transactions are users of the ongoing Voyage quest, a crucial initiative designed to help stress-test the network. The network has also shown unprecedented developer activity, with over 4.3 M unique addresses that have deployed more than 1.8M contracts, showcasing a vibrant and engaged developer community.\n\nMore than 100 global partners and protocols are committed to launching on Linea mainnet.\n\n![|548.3761663043992x346.38966281791863](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3SV8rNrgaImVdrUQe477aAfzbcPcw48RlEdxvDjsvBorhicWCEH4IglX-VCtNXSMkqGuaT-VvN1YTyu5BBeFKF7TsHy2fei3rWcfOaTf4HhLw5OrompyE1_BlJtu7iztEVGInOpz_efMakkVy38CJwo)\n\n### Vortex - Lattice-Based SNARKs\n\nLinea's exciting feature is its ability to consolidate transactions and submit proofs to the Ethereum main net using a novel prover mechanism with impressive performance and efficiency. This process increases throughput and reduces transaction fees while maintaining the inherent security of the Ethereum network.\n\nVortex, a cryptographic primitive developed at Consensys, is designed to boost Linea's performance. It employs a new type of zkProof known as a recursive aggregation proof based on Ring-SIS, a fundamental concept in lattice-based cryptography. This proofing system enables transaction batching, which enhances the network's throughput and reduces fees. Linea also uses zk circuits for computations, which aids in secure and efficient calculations.\n\n![Vortex|534x294.4](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HTqoK2NzqeDBXGLj0MT2wieswaN4Fmj_6kGRmJoy8YX1YSPUllMiVMyr-qfbSjWxIAmQsb2rO2qPH2vgNo53eHdGNgNWaDhRs1WBT3eSTETFpi54dWDZqsKMVk9vPfoI3Va_kYY3JbpsT5uhgXGTwhw)\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Market Adoption\n\nLinea allows Aave to leverage the Consensys product suite distribution instantly. Linea prioritizes User Experience (UX), aiming to eliminate barriers for MetaMask's impressive community of 30M MAUs. By securing native support in the default MetaMask network dropdown list, Linea enhances user convenience and fully supports all MetaMask curated experiences. These include On/Off Ramp, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, the Portfolio dApp, and the MetaMask SDK, presenting numerous opportunities for incorporating the Aave protocol.\n\n![|567.7854671280277x358.33572179744243](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZXbCk4Wp55U6KmwfWtLo0c-s_TYgR7N2fGQeNGYFUGGS10dJcExeO4J1yi4y7nl5bs3ihs0GxXnMzNEg7FknnQvdsuS0e2iV6LuVu4hU0o1uiVAv8PA6Jzs-INGplFb98wUvxKCILlEZmBRsTQuP7JE)\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between Linea and Consensys products, specifically MetaMask, presents clear benefits. MetaMask is pivotal to bootstrapping Linea's activity through simple onboarding, while Linea plays a significant role in supporting MetaMask's future evolution.\n\n### Key Aave Benefits\n\nSome key benefits to Aave regarding the testnet and mainnet deployments include:\n\n1. **Establishment of Aave markets and $GHO on Linea** - Linea's integration with the ConsenSys product suite provides Aave access to a vast and well-established user base that will facilitate distribution and onboarding for the Linea network. This enables smoother distribution and adoption of Aave markets and $GHO. The strategic alignment bolsters Aave's market reach and stimulates fresh opportunities for user engagement, ultimately contributing to Aave's growth and visibility.\n\n2. **Being a Linea Launch Partner** - Consensys is organizing a significant promotion for the Linea mainnet expected in July. This includes marketing initiatives, partner highlights, IRL, and online presence. Aave benefits from these efforts through its testnet deployment and subsequent mainnet approval.\n\n### Aave <> Linea Values Alignment\n\nAAVE and Linea are committed to advancing decentralized systems and fostering innovation in the DeFi space. Both products prioritize growth and development of next-generation applications, with AAVE encouraging innovation in DeFi, and Linea enabling developers and enterprises worldwide to build modern financial infrastructure. Moreover, AAVE's focus on community engagement and investment in startups that add value to the ecosystem echoes Linea and ConsenSys' mission to serve millions of users and support a robust developer community.\n\n### Existing Collaboration Efforts\n\nThe Linea Team successfully conducted a \"First Class Linea Citizen\" campaign, seamlessly incorporating sybil protection into quest activities. This initiative resulted from a collaborative effort between Linea, Aave, and the Lens team to integrate the Lens tech stack into the Linea network.\n\nCreating Lineaster (Lens stack) on the testnet yielded impressive results, with over 257K Lens handles established, accompanied by more than 192K posts, 130K follow actions, and 10K comments. While not directly related to Aave, these results showcase the successful collaborative efforts between Aave-related entities and the Linea team.\n\n### Bridge Security\n\nThe Linea team operates and maintains a canonical Open Messaging Service (OMS), allowing messages to pass to and from Ethereum & Linea. The Ethereum network verifies smart contracts on the L1 that enforce a valid state on Linea. The canonical OMS leverages our zk prover to maintain verifiability.\n\nMoreover, the design implements a trustless relayer and leverages the rollup to maintain state/security. There are plans to secure the bridge (relayer) through decentralization; however, the priority remains on decentralizing the prover and sequencer.\n\nFor a technical walk-through of the cross-chain messaging functionality, please see [Linea Documentation](https://docs.linea.build/developers/use-message-bridge#l1-to-l2).\n\n## Specification [Technical Considerations]\n\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on the Linea testnet before its mainnet launch.\n\n**Oracles** - While the network is not currently integrated with Chainlink, the integration is expected to be completed shortly after the mainnet. In the meantime, for the testnet phase, Linea will collaborate with Aave to find suitable alternatives. It's important to note that Linea already operates with several Oracle providers, including Redstone and Umbrella.\n\n**Implementation** - The authors of this proposal are committed to working closely with the relevant parties to determine the most suitable asset and market factors for the mainnet proposal. Given that this pertains to a testnet deployment, the asset and market factors will be managed directly through Linea, ensuring an organized and effective execution.\n\n**Governance** - This proposal represents a collaborative effort between the Aave community (specifically Flipside) and Consensys/Linea. This proposal was not sponsored in any way. This ensures transparent, fair, and comprehensive governance procedures that align with the interests of all involved parties.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nLinea nor Consensys has not compensated Flipside to create this proposal and Flipside is doing this because we believe that the deployment would be in the best interest of the Aave.\n\nAll information provided above is from public sources or from the Linea team directly.\n\nThis TEMP CHECK has been prepared solely to facilitate community discussion.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nFollowing a standard 7-day discussion period, Flipside will work with the community to trigger a Snapshot for a vote for testnet deployment. The Linea team will handle all technical deployment activities. Linea will also engage with necessary parties to complete all required work.\n\nFrom here, we will openly communicate progress with the community and the intended progression when all technical dependencies are met. These activities ensure that Aave can be a Linea launch partner in July.",

        "title": "[TEMP CHECK] Aave V3 Deployment on the Spiderchain (Botanix Labs)",
        "author": "0xF1dF824419879Bb8a7E758173523F88EfB7Af193",
        "body": "## Author: @ACI\n## Date: 2024-11-13\n\n---\n\n**Proposal Overview:**\n\nThis TEMP CHECK seeks to gauge the Aave community’s interest in deploying Aave V3 on the Spiderchain, the leading Bitcoin EVM L2 developed by Botanix Labs. \n\nBotanix Labs proposes this integration to expand Aave within the emerging Bitcoin DeFi narrative, with the first Bitcoin L2 with a full DeFi ecosystem and the largest community of users - including a new market of Bitcoiners transacting on chain for the first time. Upon mainnet launch, Botanix will also present to the market its synthetic 1:1 representation of Bitcoin on the L2, which will be the most decentralized form of “wrapped” Bitcoin in the EVM ecosystem. \n\nThis can help diversify the type of Bitcoin assets on Aave, especially considering its acceptance by the Bitcoin community. Botanix also intends to incorporate the GHO stablecoin throughout the ecosystem to further strategically align with Aave, providing incremental revenue upside for Aave DAO.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe Spiderchain is the first fully decentralized EVM-equivalent Layer 2 on Bitcoin, where the ease and versatility of EVM meets the decentralization and security of Bitcoin. Leveraging Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) as a Layer 1 for base settlement and decentralization, Botanix Labs will use a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model, where the stakes (represented by bitcoin) are securely stored on the Spiderchain, a distributed network of decentralized multisigs safeguarded by a randomized subset of participants. Botanix runs on Bitcoin, with BTC as the gas token and settlement layer, and yield accrued back to stakers in native BTC. The Spiderchain is the most performant Bitcoin L2 EVM with average block times of ~5 seconds and gas fees of $0.01 per transaction. As noted above, Botanix’ form of “wrapped” Bitcoin will be the most decentralized form of Bitcoin in the L2 EVM ecosystem - with decentralized sequencers available on Day 1. As such, Aave’s counterparty risk with BTC derivatives will be significantly reduced and offer greater asset diversification, especially as the Spiderchain enjoys widespread acceptance within the technical community.\n\nThe Botanix Labs team preempted the Bitcoin Season II narrative and has been building for almost two years. As such, they have already built out the major DeFi primitives required for an end-to-end DeFi experience with ~20 native ecosystem teams and another ~40 dApps (including Tier 1 DeFi protocols such as Vertex, Frax, Kiln, etc.) deploying Day 1 of mainnet. The non-incentivized testnet v0 launched in November 2023 and garnered 1.5M transactions, 500K users/wallets connected, 30K contracts launched community. Botanix Labs also has ~60K highly engaged community members, making it the largest organic community in Bitcoin. Despite not having a chain-level points program, the team has secured significant Day 1 liquidity commitments.\n\nBy deploying Aave V3 on the Spiderchain, they aim to enhance liquidity options and provide users with more opportunities within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n**Reasons for Integration:**\n\n1. **Early Mover Advantage within Bitcoin DeFi as a Launch Partner**\n    - With a deployment on the Spiderchain, and considering Aave’s brand as the incumbent leader in DeFi, Aave has the potential to capture significant early mover advantage on the only Bitcoin chain with a high-quality DeFi ecosystem as the flagship lending protocol. As the most decentralized Bitcoin-aligned chain, Botanix Labs has also secured net new TVL commitments from BTC whales who have previously never engaged with DeFi.\n2. **Access and Penetration to Bitcoiner userbase**\n    - The Spiderchain plans to be the home of Bitcoin-native DeFi, whereby once a user onboards their Bitcoin to the Botanix EVM, they can have an end-to-end DeFi experience (DEX, stablecoins, lending/borrowing, derivatives, staking, etc.) and experience native bitcoin yield without necessarily bridging to other chains. As such, it attracts a new Bitcoiner profile that is excited about DeFi and the potential of earning yield. With an integration, Aave can attract this new set of on-chain users.\n3. **Integration with GHO within the Spiderchain ecosystem**\n    - Botanix Labs will integrate and support the GHO stablecoin across the ecosystem, as one of the key USD stablecoins that will enable users to borrow against their BTC collateral.\n    - The core product of the GHO stablecoin, backed by BTC, is one of the most anticipated use cases for Bitcoiners and the Botanix team expects rapid adoption of this primitive. Assuming a linear increase in GHO borrowing caps, the team expects a high capture rate of new borrows with Aave DAO being the primary beneficiary in this interest income upside.\n4. **Innovation within Bitcoin Scaling**\n    - The Spiderchain is well accepted as a meaningful technical innovation within the Bitcoin community, with its innovation of decentralized multisigs supported by PoS being recognized as one of the few L2 scaling designs that is possible today on Bitcoin core without any soft forks needed.\n5. **Most Performant Bitcoin L2**\n    - The Spiderchain offers high throughput and low latency, with 5 second block times, which can support Aave’s transaction demands and maintain user experience.\n    - Lower transaction fees on the Spiderchain can reduce operational costs for Aave users and make DeFi activities more affordable.\n6. **Strategic Partnership with Chainlink**\n    - Chainlink Labs is a strategic partner of Botanix Labs, as a key infrastructure and market partner. Botanix Labs will integrate with ChainLink’s Price Feeds as the oracle provider for the market, and with the recently announced Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) to enhance the functionality and security of Aave on the Spiderchain.\n7. **Liquidity Provision**\n    - As Botanix Labs is deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem, they have been able to secure significant liquidity commitments and can bootstrap initial liquidity for Aave to run smoothly upon deployment. Exact LP details can be determined in the next phase of the deployment process, but we can conservatively expect at least $20M in BTC commitments to Aave upon mainnet launch.\n\n**Technical Feasibility:**\n\n1. **Seamless Integration and Compatibility with v4:**\n    - The Spiderchain is EVM-equivalent, running the rust implementation of the EVM (reth), ensuring an easy integration with Aave V3’s existing codebase.\n2. **Chainlink Integration:**\n    - ChainLink’s Price Feeds will be available Day 1 of mainnet, along with CCIP as the canonical bridging partner.\n3. **The Graph Integration:**\n    - Botanix Labs will have The Graph’s subgraph functionality enabled Day 1 of mainnet, ensuring an easy migration for Aave.\n4. **Development and Testing:**\n    - Botanix Labs will coordinate with Aave’s technical team including BGD to ensure a seamless deployment, including comprehensive testing on Botanix’s testnet.\n5. **Security Audits:**\n    - Botanix Labs will work with Aave’s security team to perform thorough audits and ensure that the deployment meets all security standards.\n\n**Deployment Plan:**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Initial Discussion**\n    - Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n2. **Phase 2: Detailed Proposal**\n    - If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n3. **Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring**\n    - Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on the Spiderchain and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n**Risks and Mitigations:**\n\n1. **Technical Challenges:**\n    - Botanix Labs will work closely with Aave’s developers and service providers (such as BGD and ACI) to address any technical challenges during integration.\n2. **Security Risks:**\n    - A comprehensive security audit will be conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This would be in addition to the proposal’s review by Aave’s risk managers, Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk.\n3. **Community Adoption:**\n    - They will engage with the Aave community throughout the process to ensure alignment and support.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nWe invite the Aave community to express their support or concerns regarding this TEMP CHECK. Your feedback is crucial in determining whether to proceed with a detailed ARFC for the Aave V3 deployment on the Spiderchain, and will help us ensure that the integration aligns with Aave’s goals and community interests.\n\n**Links and References:**\n\n- The Spiderchain Overview: https://docs.botanixlabs.xyz/botanix-labs/\n- Aave V3 Technical Documentation: https://docs.aave.com/developers\n- Botanix Labs: https://botanixlabs.xyz/\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
