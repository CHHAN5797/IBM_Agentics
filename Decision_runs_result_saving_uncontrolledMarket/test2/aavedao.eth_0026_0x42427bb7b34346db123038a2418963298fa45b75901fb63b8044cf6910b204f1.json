Recent rounds of Merit have been successful, and we aim to build upon this success while adapting to new strategies and market conditions.\n\nMerit aims to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program. Therefore, it needs to be updated and adapted when new strategies can be applied.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Boosters Update**\n\n1. Retain and Expand:\n   Expansion of Second Degree Aligned Users Booster: This booster will reward users of Defisaver and **now also Gnosis Safe**, recognizing their importance in the broader DeFi ecosystem and encouraging their integration with Aave.\n\n2. Remove:\n   - \"Diversity supporter\" LST boost. This will be replaced by a dedicated boost for the Etherfi Aave market, allowing for more targeted incentives.\n   - **GHO minting rewards in favor of StkGHO**. With the recent policy to tap the GHO borrow rate to match the MakerDAO DSR, the cost of minting GHO was decreased significantly, leading to a \"Net\" borrow rate below markets, especially for users also benefiting from the StkAAVE discount. This has made the maintenance of the peg of GHO more difficult as the carry trade opportunity has been seen as attractive for some users. We consider it more efficient to focus Merit on StkGHO for Round 7.\n\n\n3. New Addition:\n   - **Etherfi Aave Market Boost**: A new, dedicated boost will be created to support and incentivize participation in the Etherfi Aave market, recognizing its unique position in the ecosystem This expansion is contingent on Governance approval of its deployment\n\n### Next Steps\n1 escalate this [ARFC-Addendum] proposal to a Snapshot vote for formal approval.\n2. If [ARFC Addendum] is approved in the Snapshot phase, apply changes to Merit Round 7.\n\n### Disclaimer\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes \"Merit\" without external compensation.\n\n### Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\nTitle: [ARFC-Addendum] Update Merit for Round 4\nDate: 2024-05-09\nAuthor: ACI (Aave-chan Initiative)\n---\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nWe propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency, as well as evolving the wETH part of the merit program with a new program called “Ahab”.\n\n###  Motivation\n\nMerit’s first quarter and three initial rounds have been a clear success. Morpho Optimizers are now a dead product with zombie remaining TVL, and GHO grew to $54M despite unfavorable market conditions. The Aave protocol maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. While “Merit is Forever” has been approved by governance, we aim to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program.\n\n### Specification\n\n#### Boosters Update\n\nRemoval of “Second-degree user of aligned protocol”: due to lack of demand from second-degree protocols and investment in positioning Aave at the front row, this booster is no longer justified. We will reconsider reintroduction if some protocols show signs of Aave-alignment.\nIntroducing weETH in the “Diversity supporter” boost: weETH is the fastest-growing reserve in Aave V3 Ethereum, and this boost was designed to favor alternatives to main LST. It might be worth introducing a LRT to this boost.\nRemoval of OG DAO participant: this boost was designed to reward early participants in the Aave DAO, but it seems unfair for new users to keep having this boost after more than a quarter. We propose doubling the “Active in governance” boost to favor users supporting the DAO voting activity.\n\n#### Diluters Update\n\nStkGHO Cooldown users: we consider users declaring their intent to leave the safety module should not receive Merit rewards. A full dilution is seen as punitive and not in line with Aave’s ethos, so we propose stopping the points meter when these users call the cooldown method, allowing them to accumulate points until the cooldown activation.\nMorpho Users: The Morpho protocol continues to show direct hostility towards the Aave ecosystem onchain & offchain. We propose including all present and future Morpho products.\n\n#### Merit wETH Program\n\nThe merit wETH program has both been a total success and below expectations. This program has factually been the opportunity for >250k ETH to leave other protocols to join Aave, but these results are almost exclusively due to direct coordinated BD actions from Aave Finance & ACI with a small subset of “whale” users.\n\nWe consider it an inefficient allocation of resources to continue the program as it is. To upgrade this program, we propose focusing on the most efficient aspect and focusing on the BD “whale hunter” efforts. We propose rebranding this new part of the program as the “Ahab” program, which is expected to be significantly more budget-efficient than the current program.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community consensus on this proposed path.\n2. If there is agreement, escalate this ARFC-Addendum proposal to a snapshot vote for formal approval.\n\n### Disclamer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes “Merit” without external compensation.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

This proposal aims to enhance the efficiency of the StkGHO cooldown by creating a \"fast exit mechanism\".\n\nThis Simple \"FastPass\" implementation, whitelist dedicated service providers ( @karpatkey_TokenLogic & @ACI) to implement up to 2.5M \"buy walls\" via Cowswap limit orders at 0.99 GHO per stkGHO to allow StkGHO holders to leave the GHO safety module with a small fee.\n\nFastPass mainteners GHO will be considered as StkGHO in the context of merit and eligible for rewards, to reduce their opportunity costs and incentives their service for the GHO stakers.\n\nAs limit orders are filled by the market the service providers are responsible to call cooldown and replenish their fastPass liquidity overtime.\n\n### Specification\n\n1. Whitelist Service Providers for StkGHO Buy Walls:\n  * Implement a whitelist service provider addresses mobilized to create and maintain StkGHO buy orders.\n  * Allow whitelisted service providers to receive StkGHO yield on the GHO they mobilize to place StkGHO buy walls at 0.99 StkGHO.\n  * This approach replaces the previously proposed \"FastPass\" mechanism, offering a more targeted solution to improve liquidity and fast exits for StkGHO without the need for complex technical implementation.\n2. Remove the Cooldown Diluter:\n  * Given GHO's demonstrated stability and successful navigation of its first volatility black swan event, the current harsh policy towards users leaving the Safety Module is no longer justified.\n  * This change will make the process of exiting the Safety Module more user-friendly while maintaining necessary protocol safeguards.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Escalate this [ARFC-Addendum] proposal to a Snapshot vote for formal approval.\n2. If [ARFC Addendum] is approved in the Snapshot phase:\n  * Implement the whitelist system for service providers to act as StkGHO buy walls.\n  * Remove the cooldown diluter from the Safety Module.\n  * Update relevant smart contracts and documentation to reflect these changes.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) independently proposes these changes without external compensation.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## [ARFC-Addendum] Update Boosters for Merit Round 6\n\n## Author:  ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\n\n## Date: 2024-07-03\n\n---\n\n## **Summary**\n\nWe propose updating Merit parameters and rewarded actions to increase program efficiency and to reflect latest narratives to continue to boost Aave DAO and Merit for Round 6.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe Aave protocol maintained and developed its market share in DeFi in a highly competitive landscape thanks to the Merit program. Latest rounds of Merit have been a success.\n\nMerit aims to maximize efficiency while being conscious of the budget weight of this program, therefore it needs to be updated and adapted when narratives change and new strategies can be applied for future rounds.\n\nwETH supply is key for growth, as it is the biggest revenue source for Aave DAO. wETH is essential for the Aave DAO due to its role in enhancing liquidity, providing collateral, facilitating integrations, and driving user adoption, significantly increasing Aave's revenue through interest income, fees from liquidations, and increased platform usage.\n\nWith [**[ARFC] Deploy a Lido Aave v3 Instance**](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-a-lido-aave-v3-instance/18047) being at Snapshot stage, deploying an Aave v3 instance focused on the Lido ecosystem, aiming to support leveraged staking of stETH and wETH, benefiting both Aave and Lido users, it makes sense to align with Merit.\n\nFinally, with **[GHO being launched on Arbitrum](https://avara.xyz/blog/gho-stablecoin-now-live-on-arbitrum)** yesterday, it’s a strategic move to expand into Merit Program rewards for StkGHO to Arbitrum Safety Module if Governance approve its deployment. So for future Merit 6 Round, staking GHO to Arbitrum SM will be a reward action under Merit.\n\n### Specification\n\n**Boosters Update**\n\n- Removal of weETH in the “Diversity supporter” LST boost.\n- Removal of OG DAO participant (Booster for early DAO voters or delegates). This boost was meant to support early adopters, after 5 rounds of boost, it’s time to make all users, old and new on equal footing\n- Introducing wETH supplier “Eth Maxi” Boost: this will be a Boost for Ethereum and a pre-approval for wETH Arbitrum and Aave Lido markets, in order to incentivize them.\n\nIn order to be elegible for the Eth Maxi Boost, a user would need to either supply wETH (have awETH balance) and borrow GHO or stake GHO in order to have aStkGHO balance. this boost also apply to wETH suppliers on Arbitrum market\n\n- Introducing Ahab program to wETH suppliers to the Aave Lido Instance to initiate a Liquidity Mining Program.\n- Potentially expand Merit StkGHO to Arbitrum Safety Module if Governance approve its deployment.\n\nActivation of ACI as Emission manager for wETH on Mainnet, Arbitrum & if approved by governance on Aave lido market to implement Liquidity mining programs.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community consensus on this [ARFC Addendum].\n2. If there is agreement, escalate this [ARFC-Addendum] proposal to a Snapshot vote for formal approval.\n3. If [ARFC Addendum] is approved in Snapshot phase, apply changes to Merit Round 6.\n\n### Disclamer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes “Merit” without external compensation.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

The system incorporates merit boosters and diluters to adjust user rewards based on their alignment with Aave's objectives. The initiative starts with a budget of 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO, totaling 5M$ for a 90-day duration, focusing on direct Aave protocol engagement and promoting diversified staking strategies.\n\n### Rewarded Actions\n\nActions that align with Aave's strategic objectives will be rewarded:\n\n| Action |\n| --- |\n| Borrow wETH |\n| Borrow GHO |\n\n### Merit boosters\n\nMerit boosters enhance these rewards for specific behaviors:\n\n| Behavior | Multiplier description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Second-degree user of aligned protocol | booster for users coming from aligned protocols that favor Aave over other protocols. |\n| Migrator | Incentive for moving positions to Aave from others protocols |\n| Diversity Supporter | Rewards for using minority LSTs |\n| Aavenger | usage of AAVE as collateral\n| MakerDAO fren | usage of sDAI as collateral\n| OG DAO Participant | Booster for early DAO voters or delegates |\n| Holdooor | Booster for ≥100-day AAVE holders in the past year |\n| Stakoor | Booster for ≥100-day StkAAVE holders in the past year |\n| Staker | Bonus for staking AAVE, StkBPT, StkGHO |\n| Active in Governance | Rewards for voting or delegating to an Aave DAO recognized delegate platform |\n\n### Merit Diluters\n\nMerit Diluters will dilute part or all rewards for certain behaviors:\n\n| Behavior | Dilution Description/Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| User of Non-Aligned Protocol | Severe dilution (up to -100%) |\n\n### Non-aligned protocol list:\n\nWe propose to launch Merit with a single protocol with non-aligned status: **Morpho Aave Optimizers V2 & V3**\n\n### Migration bonus multipliers list:\n\nWe propose to apply the “migratooor” Boosters to users leaving the following protocols to join the Aave ecosystem:\n\n- Morpho V2\n- Morpho V3\n- Morpho Blue\n- Spark\n\n\n### Budget and Scope\n\n- **Bi-Weekly Budget:** Defined by Aave Finance service providers, all data will be published publicly after the Merit program ends.\n- **Total Budget:** **5M$ with 2.1M$ in wETH and 2.9M$ in GHO for 90 days.**\n- **Scope:** Aave V3 Ethereum.\n\n### Synergies\n\nNumerous protocols reached out during the TEMP CHECK period to co-incentive merit; @karpatkey_TokenLogic via Aave Finance are coordinating these efforts, and their incentives are expected to be on top of the Merit budget.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Refine the proposal details based on community feedback to achieve consensus.\n2. Conduct a snapshot vote for community sentiment.\n3. Following a successful snapshot outcome, escalate to the AIP stage for official voting and implementation.\n\n## Disclosure\nThe Aave Chan Initiative independently proposes \"Merit,\" without external compensation.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived under [Creative Commons Zero (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
