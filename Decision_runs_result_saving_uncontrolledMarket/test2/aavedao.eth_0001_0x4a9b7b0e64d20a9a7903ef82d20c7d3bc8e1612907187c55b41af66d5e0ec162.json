        "body": "## [TEMP CHECK] Onboard USD1 to Aave V3 Core and BNB Instance\n\n### Author: World Liberty Finance (WLFI)\n\n### Date: 2025-06-14\n\n### Summary\n\nWorld Liberty Financial (WLFI) proposes the listing of USD1, a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by WLFI, on Aave V3 Core and BNB Instances.\n\nThis listing would initially enable users to deposit USD1 to earn yield and borrow USD1 as a stable asset. \n\nCollateral usage will be considered at a later date following review by Aave’s Risk Management teams.\n\n### Motivation\n\nUSD1 is a next-generation stablecoin backed 1:1 by cash and short-term U.S. Treasuries,designed for maximum regulatory compliance, transparency, and on-chain verifiability. \n\nAs the fastest-growing stablecoin in history, USD1 has rapidly gained adoption across centralized and decentralized platforms, demonstrating strong market demand and growing utility.\n\nKey differentiators:\n1. Regulatory compliance: USD1 is structured to meet stringent U.S. financial regulations and disclosure standards.\n2. Chainlink Proof of Reserves: USD1 will be the first stablecoin to implement Chainlink’s PoR natively, providing real-time transparency of backing assets.\n3. Chainlink price feed: Live and available for use in Aave integrations.\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers and proposal will be updated accordingly.\n\nUSD1 Overview:\n\n- Ticker: USD1\n- Fiat backed stablecoin\n- Issuer: World Liberty Financial (WLFI)\n- Backing assets: USD cash and short-term U.S treasuries.\n- Audits: PeckShield\n- Price Oracle: Chainlink\n- USD1 Listed on: Binance, ByBit, KuCoin, BitGet, MEXC, HTX.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n1. Deposits enabled for yield generation\n2. Borrowing enabled as a low-volatility asset\n\n### Incentives:\n\nWLFI plans to provide incentives to grow adoption and improve the competitiveness of borrowing rates for USD1 relative to other stablecoin assets on Aave. \n\nSpecific programs will be shared with Aave DAO contributors and the community in ARFC stage.\n\n### Disclosure\n\nThe current proposal has been powered by Skywards. ACI is not afiliated with WLFI and has not received compensation for the creation and edit of this proposal.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of TEMP CHECK to gather community & service providers feedback, and escalate to TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n2. Publication of a standard ARFC, if TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed, to continue collecting community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

USDtb can be used the same way a holder would use any other dollar, whether to send and receive payments, acquire and trade assets, or to simply hold dollars.\n\nUnlike actual dollars, USDtb is a blockchain-based token, which enables faster and cheaper spending than the traditional fiat banking system. Unlike many digital assets, USDtb is fully backed by institutional-grade tokenized U.S. treasury fund products (alongside a stablecoin reserve designed to facilitate rapid redemptions) to support stability. Initially, USDtb will be backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund Token, BUIDL.\n\nBy onboarding USDtb, deeper borrow liquidity will be generated to allow sUSDe leverage at an attractive borrow rate. We believe this will help revitalise and accelerate growth in sUSDe activity on the Core Instance.\n\nBacked by BUIDL issued by Blackrock, one of the largest asset managers in the world we believe this asset aligns well with Aave’s history of providing liquidity to the highest quality assets in DeFi and should attract significant deposits.\n\n### Specification\n\n- Onboard to Core Instance\n- Borrow enabled\n- Collateral disabled\n- L1 token contract address: 0xC139190F447e929f090Edeb554D95AbB8b18aC1C\n\n> Risk Parameters have been provided on 2025-04-21\n\n| **Parameter** | **Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asset | USDtb |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | No |\n| Supply Cap | 50,000,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 40,000,000 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | - |\n| LT | - |\n| Liquidation Penalty | - |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | - |\n| Variable Base | 0 |\n| Variable Slope1 | 6% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 50% |\n| Uoptimal | 80% |\n| Reserve Factor | 10% |\n| Stable Borrowing | Disabled |\n| Flashloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowable in Isolation | No |\n| E-Mode Category | N/A |\n\n### Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments\n\n- Ethena will deposit a significant amount of USDtb.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- Docs: https://docs.usdtb.money/\n- Transparency dashboard: https://usdtb.money/transparency\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
