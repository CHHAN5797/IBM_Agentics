        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Polygon v2 Borrow Rate Adjustments\nAuthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic & @ChaosLabs \nCreated: 2024-04-04\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes gradually revising the Borrow Rate on Polygon v2 to provide further encouragement for users to migrate to Aave v3.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the last [8 months](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/284/) the Reserve Factor (RF) on Polygon v2 has gradually increased from as low as 21.00% to 99.99%. As a result, deposit yield converged to zero and the capital efficiency of Aave v2 has been reduced on Polygon.\n\nWith the RF now approaching the maximum across all reserves, this publication seek to gradually increase the cost of capital via periodic borrow rate adjustments, every two weeks in a predictable fashion.\n\nBased upon recent borrow rates behaviour, the market has demonstrated the ability to withstand periods of elevated borrowing rates. \n\n## Non Frozen Assets\n\nFor non-frozen assets, this proposal recommends increasing the Slope1 parameter by 75bps every two weeks, or 1.5% per month, to encourage further migration of users from v2 to v3. The outcome of this [vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xe2dd228640c3cad93f5418c40c4b5743b3c6c85aa0aae9eee53cbdbca2ed5c2d) has been taken into consideration when drafting the current IR parameters included in this proposal.\n\nThe Slope2 parameter is to be revised to discourage utilisation exceeding the Uoptimal value. Note, several reserves are experiencing utilisation marginally exceeding Uoptimal. \n\nAs utilisation of each reserve decreases over time, the Uoptimal will be periodically lowered to discourage new debt positions emerging. Any proposed changes to the Uoptimal parameter will be presented via a separate ARFC. \n\nUpon implementation, this change will not trigger liquidation of any users funds and will gradually increase the cost for users who remain on v2. Please note, there is a Migration Tool that was developed by BGD to aid users migrating from v2 to v3. \n\nAssets in scope: DAI, MATIC, wBTC, wETH, USDC and USDT.\n\n## Frozen Assets\n\nEach frozen reserve contains a small portion of funds with a very minimal amount of debt. For these assets we recommend a more aggressive implementation: reduce the Uoptimal to 10.00%, revise Slope1 to 50.00% and Slope2 to 500.00% - with  the exception of BAL, which receives a Uoptimal of 20% due to current utilisation being around 15%.\n\nAssets in scope: BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK and SUSHI.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated as follows:\n\n| Asset | Current Slope1 | Proposed Slope1 | Current Uoptimal | Proposed Uoptimal | Current Slope2 | Proposed Slope2 |\n| :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   |\n| BAL   | 27.00% | 50.00% | 65.00% | 20.00% | 236.00% | 500.00% |\n| CRV   | 17.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 392.00% | 500.00% |\n| DAI   | 12.00% | 12.75% | 71.00% | 71.00% | 105.00% |   200.00% |\n| GHST  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 23.00% | 10.00% | 413.00% | 500.00% |\n| LINK  |  7.00% | 50.00% | 25.00% | 10.00% | 402.00% | 500.00% |\n| USDT  | 12.00% | 12.75% | 52.00% | 52.00% | 236.00% |   236.00% |\n| wBTC  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 37.00% | 37.00% | 536.00% |   536.00% |\n| wETH  |  4.00% |  4.75% | 40.00% | 40.00% | 167.00% |   200.00% |\n| wMATIC|  6.00% |  6.75% | 48.00% | 48.00% | 440.00% |   500.00% |\n| wUSDC | 12.00% | 12.75% | 77.00% | 77.00% | 134.00% |   200.00% |\n\nSubject to approval from @ChaosLabs, a subsequent proposal will be submitted every two weeks.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n4) Review, and where applicable, submit an AIP every 2 weeks\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal.

To minimise governance overhead, the Ethereum v2 and Avalanche v2 updates will be combined, with the later implemented by the Guardian. There remains only one to two Polygon RF updates and these will be submitted separately.\n\nDo note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect user's health factor, and this method has already been implemented on [Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-reserve-factor-updates-polygon-aave-v2/13937) and [Ethereum v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-ethereum-v2-reserve-factor-adjustment/16764).\n\n# Specification\n\nThe below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.\n\n| Asset | Current RF| Initial RF Increase | Subsequent RF Increase|\n| :---:  | :---:    |:---:     |:---:     |\n| DAI.e  | 10.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n| USDC.e | 10.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n| USDT.e | 10.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n| wAVAX  | 15.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n| WBTC.e | 10.00% | 40.00% | 45.00% |\n| WETH.e | 10.00% | 35.00% | 40.00% |\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal.

Users are encourage to migrate to v3 in search of higher yield.\n\nWith market conditions permitting, we propose initiating a periodic 5.00% RF increase across all assets every 14 days as mentioned [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-chaos-labs-incremental-reserve-factor-updates-aave-v2-ethereum/13766) up to a threshold of 99.99%. During each increase cycle, we will monitor how users respond and, if any potential risks are identified, the next RF increase will be delayed until it is safe to implement.\n\nDo note increasing the RF parameter does not directly affect users' health factor, and this method has already been [implemented on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-polygon-v2-to-v3-liquidity-migration/12350) for some time. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe below shows the current and proposed RF for each reserve.\n\n| Asset | Current RF| Recommended RF | \n| ---  | ---    |---     |\n| 1INCH| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| AMPL | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BUSD | 99.90% | 99.99% |\n| BAL  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| BAT  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CRV  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| CVX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| DAI  | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| DPI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENS  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ENJ  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FEI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| FRAX | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| GUSD | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| KNC  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| LINK | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| LUSD | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| MANA | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| MKR  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| RAI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| REN  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| renFIL| 35.00%| 99.99% |\n| SNX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| sUSD | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| SUSHI| 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| TUSD | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| UNI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| USDC | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| USDP | 20.00% | 25.00% |\n| USDT | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| UST  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| wBTC | 30.00% | 35.00% |\n| wETH | 25.00% | 30.00% |\n| YFI  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n| ZRX  | 99.00% | 99.99% |\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted every 2 weeks that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%, subject to market conditions. \n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n4) Subsequent AIP submission are expected to follow every 14 days thereafter\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Prime Instance - wstETH Borrow Rate + rsETH Supply Cap Update \nauthor: @TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-01-14\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes reducing the wstETH Slope1 and increasing the rsETH Supply Cap.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe Prime instance of Aave v3 on Ethereum has experienced significant growth since its launch in Q3 2024, attracting over $2 billion in user deposits.\n\nTo support continued growth, this proposal suggests lowering the wstETH Slope1 parameter to align the borrow rate with market conditions. Based on feedback from the Renzo and Kelp teams, this adjustment is expected to drive an additional $300 million in user deposits to the Prime instance.\n\nExpected Benefits of Reducing the Slope1 Parameter:\n\n* ~72% increase in LRT deposits.\n* ~50% increase in the wstETH Deposit Rate to 60 bps.\n* ~50% increase in wstETH Borrow Rate fee generation.\n* ~35% increase in the native wETH Deposit Rate.\n\nLowering the Slope1 parameter will encourage new LRT deposits, boosting the LRT/LST yield-generating strategy, which is projected to outperform the LST/wETH strategy. With LRT deposit incentives, this strategy further enhances Prime's appeal.\n\nAs utilisation of wETH reserves across Core, Spark, and Prime approaches Uoptimal, the Prime instance of Aave v3 offers the highest native yield for LST/wETH yield strategies. The improved wstETH deposit rate solidifies Prime's competitive position in the market.\n\n## rsETH Supply Cap\n\nrsETH has shown strong growth on the Core instance of Aave v3, while the Prime market has yet to attract rsETH deposits due to the lower wstETH Borrow Rate on Core and a small supply cap.\n\nLowering the wstETH Borrow Rate on Prime would make borrowing wstETH more attractive. Feedback from the Kelp team suggests strong demand for rsETH beyond the current supply cap's capacity.\n\nTo support leveraged LRT/LST yield strategies, this proposal recommends a significant increase to the rsETH supply cap, enabling larger deposits to scale effectively, optimize returns, and reduce reliance on incentives. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe following parameters on the Prime instance are to be adjusted.\n\n**wstETH Reserve**\n\n|Parameter|Current Value|Proposed Value|\n|  ---    | :---:       | :---:        |\n|Uoptimal | 90.00%      | 90.00%       |\n|Base     | 0.00%       | 0.00%        |\n|Slope1   | 1.75%       | 0.75%        |\n|Slope2   | 85.00%      | 85.00%       |\n\n**rsETH Supply Cap**\n\n| Parameter |Current Value|Proposed Value|\n|  :-----    | :---:       | :---:        |\n|Supply Cap | 10,000      | 65,000       |\n\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic does not receive any payment for this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1.

        "author": "0x8787FC2De4De95c53e5E3a4e5459247D9773ea52",
        "body": "## Summary\nThis publication proposes progressively increasing the Reserve Factor (RF) for Bridged USDC(USDC.e & USDbC) across Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and Base Aave deployments.\n\n## Motivation\nPresently, Bridged USDC (USDC.e & USDbC) competes with native USDC on the listed markets. By gradually increasing the RF for Bridged USDC(USDC.e & USDbC), the deposit rate on these markets will become less attractive over time. Similar to other proposals, this action is expected to encourage users to switch to native USDC on the respective market.\n\nUpon implementing this proposal, a subsequent AIP will be submitted that increases the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99% every 2 weeks, subject to market conditions. The RF amendments will be incorporated into the fortnightly RF and Borrow Rate adjustment AIP to reduce voting overhead.\n\nThis method has already been implemented on Polygon v2, Ethereum v2 and also Avalanche.\n\n## Specification\nThe below shows the current RF and proposed adjustments for the first AIP.\n\n| Asset |\tMarket |\tCurrent RF |\tProposed RF |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| USDC.e |\tArbitrum |\t20.00% |\t25.00% |\n| USDC.e |\tOptimism |\t20.00% |\t25.00% |\n| USDC.e |\tPolygon |\t20.00% |\t25.00% |\n| USDbC |\tBase |\t20.00% |\t25.00% |\nSubsequent AIPs will utilise the Direct-to-AIP process and increase the RF by 5.00% up to a maximum of 99.99%.\n\nWhere practical, this AIP will be bundled with other Borrow Rate and RF amendments to reduce voting overheads.\n\n## Disclosure\nTokenLogic, karpatkey and Chaos Labs receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n2. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage.\n4. Subsequent AIP submissions are expected to follow every 14 days thereafter, if deemed applicable.\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.",
