        "body": "# Simple summary\nIntroducing a new Aave ClinicSteward smart contract, with capabilities to liquidate and repay non-healthy positions with bad debt on Aave v3, using funds of the Aave Collector, this way cleaning up all Aave v3 bad debt before the activation of the upcoming Umbrella.\n\n\n\n# Context\nSince the initial Aave v3 activation three years ago, due to the nature of liquidations, the system has accrued a minimal bad debt of approximately $400’000. This amount is pretty irrelevant in comparison with the ~$12 billion outstanding borrowings, but given the imminent activation of the Umbrella system (to automatically cover bad debt), and the recent upgrade of Aave to v3.3 (formally accounting for deficit/bad-debt post-liquidation), we believe it is appropriate to raise a proposal to clean the “legacy” bad debt, and this way start with clean accounting.\n\nThe Aave ClinicSteward is a smart contract that simply facilitates for a permissioned entity to execute the clean-up on behalf of the DAO, by authorizing a constraint budget from the Aave Collector for exclusive usage on liquidations/repayments of unhealthy positions (liquidatable).\n\n# Specification\nThe Aave ClinicSteward is a highly permissioned and constraint steward smart contract, that allows for the following:\n\n- **Batch liquidate**. Allows to liquidate positions on the configured Aave Pool, by pulling the asset to repay from the Aave Collector, and transferring the liquidated collateral back to the Collector too.\n- **Batch repay**. On Aave v3 there are some existing positions pre-Aave v3.3 with “pure” bad debt: they have outstanding borrowings, but exactly zero collateral.\nFor those cases, this steward contract allows to just repay and zero that debt, even if no collateral is recovered.\n\nIn terms of access control, the system is permissioned in the following way:\n\n- To be able to access any funds from the Aave Collector, the Aave governance needs to give FUNDS_ADMIN role to each ClinicSteward associated with an Aave v3 pool.\n\n- There is a strict budget constraint (in USD) for the amount the steward can pull from the Collector (table after).\n\n- A DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE acts as “a super-admin” of the steward, with permissions to enable any other address to call the batch liquidate and batch repay methods. This is designed to be assigned to a multi-sig smart contract, which in our opinion could be one of the denominated currently composed by ACI, TokenLogic and Kpk, with 2-of-3.\nGiven that the initial setup via governance will assign one initial CLEANUP_ROLE, we don’t expect this multi-sig to be used.\n\n- A CLEANUP_ROLE acts as the address that will factually trigger the liquidations/repayments. This is designed to be an EOA, given that its capabilities are limited by:\n  - The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE granting permissions.\n  - The steward contract has a constraint of maximum budget (in USD) to spend, which only the Aave governance can modify.\nOur recommendation is to use an EOA of the Dolce Vita service by ACI for this role, already in use for multiple other aspects now and in the past (migration of deprecated stable debt positions, accrue of fees to the treasury, etc).\n\n- The contract is not designed to have any funds at rest, so it has Rescuable capabilities to send any token there to exclusively the Aave Collector.\n\n---\n\nIn terms of budget constraints per network (maximum allowance that the ClinicSteward will be able to use from the Collector), the idea is to be able to cover current levels of bad debt per network, with some extra margin on top.\nThis allowance can be potentially renewed in the future, but only via another Aave governance proposal.\n\n| Network | Maximum allowance |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ethereum core | $30’000 |\n| Ethereum prime | $5’000 |\n| Polygon | $30’000 |\n| Avalanche | $350’000 |\n| Arbitrum | $60’000 |\n| Optimism | $5’000 |\n| Base | $15’000 |\n| Metis | $1’000 |\n| Gnosis Chain | $1’000 |\n| BNB Chain | $2’000 |\n| Scroll | $1’000 |\n| ZKSync | $1’000 |\n| Linea | $1’000 |\n\n*Total expenses will potentially be substantially lower than “Maximum allowance”, as in the majority of the cases, some collateral will be sent to the Collector, even if this is lower than the debt of the position.\n\n** v3 Avalanche being substantially higher than in other networks is due to the USDC de-peg event on 11th March 2023\n\n\nIn addition to all its constraints, the ClinicSteward is been audited by Certora, and we will share the report on the Aave governance forum once completed.",

        "body": "# Simple summary\n\nAfter different changes since the initial Risk Stewards [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204), we present to the community the final proposal for activating this system across all Aave v3 pools.\n\nThis version of Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS) include two instances:\n\n- The first is a continuation of the previous design, with the parameters recommendation risk provider (Chaos Labs), with constrained capacity to modify all type of risk parameters on Aave. As extra protection, during the initial period of updates (estimated 1-2 months), BGD Labs will join the Risk Council multi-sig in order to add an additional layer of security review. *Chaos Labs will still be the only decision maker for recommendations as defined on their professional scope with the DAO, with us BGD just being a security contributor*.\n- The second is a pilot version to automate interest rate updates of assets (starting with WETH on Aave v3 Lido Ethereum), based on the newly released risk infrastructure technology Edge, by Chaos Labs.\n\nThe repository can be found on [https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards).\n\n---\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe base motivation of Aave Generalized Risk Stewards (AGRS) is still the same as the previously proposed version [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204). After a successful initial iteration for cap updates and different GHO parameters using the Stewards pattern, Aave is prepared to generalize the solution and improve its operational efficiency and reactivity to the market.\n\nRegarding the pilot integration of AGRS with Chaos Labs new Edge infrastructure, it has the following rationale:\n\n1. Whenever aligned with other strategic and technical aspects, Aave should benefit from infrastructure built by service providers, in this case, Chaos Labs.\n2. This pilot will be very non-invasive and with only positive outcomes, as the AGRS layer will guarantee that only acceptable interest rate recommendations will reach the Aave protocol, while ideally having a way more dynamic rate.\n\n---\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## 1. AGRS + Risk provider\n\nThe main version of AGRS will follow the specifications described in the previous Risk Stewards post [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-risk-steward-phase-2-risksteward/16204#specification-3), which can be summarised in the following:\n\n- The following risk params could be changed by the RiskStewards:\n    - Supply Caps\n    - Borrow Caps\n    - LTV\n    - Liquidation Threshold\n    - Liquidation Bonus\n    - Debt Ceiling\n    - Base variable borrow rate\n    - Slope 1\n    - Slope 2\n    - Optimal point\n    - CAPO configurations\n- For each configuration type, there will be a minimum delay associated with how frequently the AGRS can be used, named `minDelay`. Ex. after increasing LTV by 5%, the operator of the AGRS (risk provider) must wait a minimum of minDelay before either doing any additional change.\n- Each configuration type will have an associated percentage-based constraint (in basis points), indicating how much the parameter can be changed via AGRS compared to the live value on Aave v3. These constraints (`maxPercentChange`) can be of 2 types:\n    - *Absolute*. E.g. for LTV a 5_00 `maxPercentChange` means that is possible to change the LTV value by +/- 5_00 basis points, or 5%, compared to the current live value. So if the current LTV is 65%, it is possible to change up to 70% or down to 60%.\n    - *Relative*. E.g. for Supply Cap a 50_00 `maxPercentChange` means that is possible to change the Supply Cap value by +/- 50_00 basis points, or 50%, proportional to the current live param. So if the current Supply Cap is 1’000’000 WETH, it is possible to change it up to 1’500’000 WETH, or down to 500’000 WETH.\n- The system allows to restrict assets for AGRS to not apply changes, to be used for example with GHO.\n- The only entity enabled to use the AGRS will be the assigned risk service provider, currently Chaos Labs. As a temporary security precaution, and to avoid introducing a timelock (given that the system should be resilient enough without it), BGD will review the params updates proposed for correctness, but without any influence on the recommendation itself.\n\n\n---\n\n\nTo start with, this component of AGRS will have the following configurations (from recommendations of the risk provider of the community):\n\n| Parameter | Percent change allowed | minimumDelay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Supply and Borrow Caps | 100% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| Debt Ceiling | 20% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| CAPO dynamic cap | 5% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| CAPO stable cap | 0.5% (relative change) | 3 days |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Slope 1 | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Slope 2 | 5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Optimal Point (Kink) | 3% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Loan to Value (LTV) | 0.25% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Liquidation Threshold | 0.25% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 0.5% (absolute change) | 3 days |\n\n\nThe principles for them in the initial phase are:\n- Still highly constraint in percentages and time, in order to not deposit too much trust to start with.\n- Similar as with caps updates, all usage of stewards will be previously disclosed on the Aave governance forum, by a framework to be defined by Chaos Labs, the risk provider in charge.\n\n\nAdditionally, the only blacklisted asset will be GHO on Ethereum, given that changes on it are usually done by the ALC (Aave Liquidity Committee) via the GHOSteward, or directly with governance proposals.\n\n---\n\n## 2. AGRS + Edge Infrastructure by Chaos Labs\n\nDays ago, the Aave risk service provider Chaos Labs [announced Edge](https://chaoslabs.xyz/posts/introducing-edge-the-next-generation-oracle),  a new product innovating on the risk infrastructure ecosystem.\n\nThis new system directly addresses a challenge for risk recommendations on Aave: how to connect as seamlessly as possible the platform of parameters recommendation run by Chaos during the last years for Aave, with the Aave protocol.\n\nWith this activation of AGRS pending, after evaluating the solution, and due to the already long contribution history of Chaos Labs, we decided that is a good opportunity to test out the usage of Edge for a specific parameter: Aave rates configurations for WETH on v3 Lido Ethereum.\n\nThis model will use another instance of AGRS (exactly the same codebase as the other model), but with the following constraints:\n\n- The AGRS + Edge instance will only have configurable rate-related parameters: base variable borrow rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2.\n- Recommendations of these parameters will be submitted to a risk oracle smart contract, from the Edge off-chain infrastructure.\n- Between the risk oracle smart contract and the AGRS contract, there will be a very thin middleware `AaveStewardsInjector` , which will have the following logic:\n    - Will take recommendations from the Edge Risk Oracle side and propagate them to the AGRS contract.\n    - Enforce that only the WETH asset can be acted upon.\n    - Given the protections (percentage constraints and time delay) on the AGRS side and that it is an assumption that risk recommendation will be the time correct on the Edge Risk Oracle, the propagation will be permissionless.\n\n\nRegarding the configurations of the AGRS + Edge instance, will be the following (for only WETH on v3 Lido Ethereum to start with):\n\n| Parameter | Percent change allowed | minimumDelay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate | 0.5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Slope 1 | 0.5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Slope 2 | 5% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n| Optimal Point (Kink) | 3% (absolute change) | 1 days |\n\n\n## Security\n\nIn addition to our internal review and testing procedures, the AGRS have been reviewed by Certora, and the report can be found [HERE](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-risk-stewards?tab=readme-ov-file#security)",

        "body": "# Simple summary\nProposal for the community to pre-approve the final activation/configuration of SVR (Smart Value Recapture) oracles on a sub-set of Aave v3 Core Ethereum assets, a system created by Chainlink to recapture MEV from Aave liquidations and return it to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Context\nAs described in the [TEMP CHECK stage](https://snapshot.box/#/s:aave.eth/proposal/0x29721c3f2d61a793b310720ffd671fe349b4f9603f066e0f5644a40e59549b96), this proposal seeks the community’s approval to integrate Chainlink’s SVR v1 system. Extensive details about its rationale and specifications can be found on Snapshot and the associated governance forum.\n\nThis ARFC delves more into the proposed initial configuration details of the initial phase (Phase 1).\n\n# Specification\nTo recap, the architecture of the new Chainlink SVR feeds to be connected to Aave is as follows:![svr-diagram-arfc.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidkqa26w7eaqaq34a2fnaz6goy7acu6g36w4jy5byb5oqsmtdfl3q)\n\nIn the integration side of Aave, there are two major components to take into account:\n\n- **SVR Feed**. This will be the one plugged into the Aave Oracle smart contracts (with the necessary CAPO adapters on top if applicable), receiving the OEV-recapturing price on-chain.\n- **Fallback feed**. This is a mirror of the “standard” price feeds currently plugged into Aave, without OEV recapture. The SVR Feed has a configurable delay fallback in seconds: as both SVR and Fallback feeds get submitted to their respective mempools in parallel, whenever the OEV doesn’t reflect on-chain for more than the delay fallback seconds but the Fallback does, the price reading is routed to the Fallback feed.\n\nThe fallback mechanism is completely fundamental security-wise, as it gives one important assurance: on average, the price availability of the overall system will be equal to or superior to the current feeds, but even in the worst-case scenario, the maximum delay to read from a “standard” Chainlink feed will be of the configured delay fallback seconds.\n\n## Initial assets configuration: controlled approach\nEven considering that the technology (Chainlink, Flashbots) is battle-tested, and the protection mechanisms embedded into SVR like the fallback, we believe the rollout of feeds should be progressive, only enabling a very limited subset of assets on v3 Core Ethereum during the first month or so.\n\nFrom our discussions with Chainlink, we think the following principles for choosing the initial assets are reasonable:\n\n- The assets consuming the feeds should have a meaningful volume of historic liquidation.\n- The majority of liquidations happening on positions consuming the chosen feeds should be due to those feeds, and not due to other assets. E.g. in positions using AAVE as collateral and borrowing USDC, the majority of liquidations happen due to the AAVE/USD price feed updates on the collateral side, as the USDC/USD feed barely changes.\n- In this first activation batch, major assets size-wise should be avoided: ETH, wstETH, WBTC, weETH.\n- Ideally, we plug in production feeds that will affect assets correlated with major ones, but smaller in size. Both tBTC and WBTC use the hood of the same BTC/USD feed, but the first is ~$82m in size versus the second ~$3b.\n\nWith the previous principles in mind, and also taking into account the extensive testing/simulations performed by Chainlink in their infrastructure during the previous couple of months, the recommendation is to enable the following SVR feeds:\n\n- **BTC/USD affecting exclusively LBTC and tBTC**.\n- **AAVE/USD**.\n- **LINK/USD**.\n\n## Other configurations: fallback delay and its nuances\nWhen choosing specific values per asset for a fallback delay, there are different points of consideration:\n\n- The fallback delay is a mechanism that will not be used on the “happy” path: when the Chainlink DON submits prices to the Flashbots auction, historical analysis shows that the majority of price updates (and so liquidations) are included in the next block, and close to 100% in the range of 1-2 blocks. That means that price reading being redirected to the “public” feed will only happen if a fallback delay is configured to less than 2 blocks (in seconds), or in very edge scenarios when auction participants don’t show up for more than 2 blocks, even if economically sound.\n- Aside from the auction aforementioned average auction speed of 0-2 blocks, configuring too low (e.g. 2 blocks) the fallback delay opens to an edge, but theoretically existing censorship vector: it could be profitable for a builder with control to build the +2 block from next on the public mempool to censor the price update on the 2 blocks on the Flashbots auction, to wait for their to-be-mined block on the public mempool.\nAgain, this vector is very theoretical but technically exists whenever the fallback delay is very short. Any increase in the fallback delay configuration makes the censorship vector exponentially more expensive, as the cost of “capturing” multiple blocks in a row gets increasingly more expensive,\n- Aave is configured very conservatively risk-wise, which means that the difference of processing a liquidation in the same block of price update versus some blocks after doesn’t put the system at all at risk.\nThis will not really be the case on the average scenario of the price being included into the block via Flashbots, as it will precisely incentivise as fast as possible inclusion, but it is a consideration to not configure the fallback delay too tigh, avoiding any type of censorship attack, even if very theoretical.\n\nConsidering the previous rationale, and also using historical analysis from Chainlink showing that there will be no loss on the risk profile of the protocol, the recommendation is to set the fallback delay on BTC/USD, AAVE/USD and LINK/USD to 5 blocks.\nThe Aave DAO via its risk provider will reserve executive power over modifying this parameter by communicating to Chainlink.\n\n## Extra protection: SvrOracleSteward\nGiven the criticality of the infrastructure activation, and to be even extra cautious, we also propose to include a new steward smart contract: the SvrOracleSteward.\n\nThe SvrOracleSteward allows for the Aave Protocol Guardian to replace, on the Aave Oracle side, a feed (e.g. CAPO) consuming one the new SVR by exclusively one used before the SVR replacement. This way, even in the very unexpected worst-case scenario of the new SVR simply not being functional or having a really major issue, the Aave Protocol Guardian could immediately swap back to the standard price feeds currently used in production.\n\nWe don’t expect this mechanism to be used anyhow, but we think it is reasonable as an extra line of defense when enabling a pretty innovative system like SVR v1 Chainlink.\n\n## OEV-recaptured recipient\nWhen using systems like Flashbots for a case like this of SVR, it is necessary to define an address to receive the native currency (e.g. ETH) recapture. Ideally, the Aave DAO would have full control over this address, but in practice, as the Chainlink DON is the entity factually building the transaction and submitting it to Flashbots, they have control over configuring it or changing it.\n\nThe Aave protocol already has a RevenueSplitter smart contract to be used as OEV beneficiary, for any non-100%/0% split between Aave and Chainlink. But given that using it or not is a purely operational consideration (as still Chainlink can change it unilaterally), we will coordinate with them to decide whats the most reasonable venue.\n\nIn any scenario, the final recipient of the OEV fees should be the Aave Collector, and we consider mandatory that distribution to it happens minimum once a week, no matter if via RevenueSplitter or via transfer from the Chainlink side.\n\n## Aave/Chainlink fee split terms\n\nSimilar to any other terms of the Aave <> Chainlink SVR partnership, it is outside of the scope of this ARFC to define the percentage of a split between Aave and Chainlink on the OEV recapture, as we (BGD) are technical service providers, and the community should vote on the configuration separately from those.\nWe will abide by any decision approved by the DAO via ARFC, configuring any technical component accordingly.",

        "body": "# Summary\nProposal to pre-approve the activation of Aave v3.2 across all Aave pool instances, a new version of v3 (currently v.3.1) including two important changes:\n\n- A new feature: Liquid eModes.\n- The removal of all deprecated stable rate logic.\n\n\n# Context\nJuly 27th, Aave governance proposal 132 3 activated Aave v3.1 across all active networks. This currently active version of the Aave protocol was focused on security improvements (e.g. introducing virtual accounting), changing the architecture of the interest rate strategies, and multiple other updates to improve the operational efficiency of the system.\n\nAdditionally, with Aave v3.1 we introduced Aave v3 Origin 4, a new repository for the Aave protocol (Foundry-based) to serve as the cornerstone to release further post-v3.1 versions faster while keeping maximum security standards.\n\nOne and a half months later, as a result of previous groundwork with v3.1 and Origin, we are glad to present to the community this new Aave v3.2 version.\n\n## Aave v3.2\nThe changes included in Aave v3.2 are more isolated than those of v3.1, and of different nature. While removing stable rate-related logic is more on the maintenance/codebase cleanup side, liquid eModes is a total user-facing and powerful feature.\n\n### 1 -  Liquid eModes\n\nAave v3 introduced the concept of eMode (efficiency mode), an abstraction within the pool for configuring groups of assets with more capital-efficient risk configurations (LTV, Liquidation Threshold). This unlocked use cases like native high-leverage or even strategies between stablecoins. eMode could be deemed one of the first experiments in DeFi at scale with the concept of pools of assets within pools of assets.\n\nThe eMode feature has seen since then tremendous success, enabling use cases like ETH-correlated eMode, allowing for higher than default risk parameters on ETH LSTs/ETH positions (or MATIC, AVAX with their LSTs). However, the eMode feature always had some room for improvement, that way truly unlocking even more powerful use cases and flexibility on Aave.\n\nA known technical limitation of the initial iteration of eMode is the following: a single eMode is optionally assigned to assets listed on Aave. That means that if let’s say WETH is assigned eMode 1 eligibility (ETH-correlated, with ETH LSTs), WETH can’t be eligible for any other eMode.\n\nIn different scenarios, this is an important constraint, as currently is not possible to have on the same Aave pool an eMode with wstETH and WETH, together with a different eMode with weETH and WETH, as WETH can only be in one of them at the same time.\n\n\n\nThe new Liquid eMode feature of Aave v3.2 removes the previous constraint: an asset listed on Aave can be eligible for different eModes, and then it only depends on the user to choose which eMode he wants to enter to.\n\nFor example, with liquid eModes, a possible configuration not doable before would be:\n\n- eMode 1, with wstETH, weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 2, with wstETH and WETH.\n- eMode 3, with weETH and WETH.\n- eMode 4, with WETH and GHO.\n\nSo then, user A holding the wstETH and weETH collaterals, could borrow WETH at high LTV. User B holding only wstETH could borrow WETH at high (but different) LTV. User C holding only weETH could similarly borrow WETH at a different LTV than the previous two eModes. User D could have a position with WETH collateral and GHO borrowings.\n\nThis doesn’t stop there, as more sophisticated configuration strategies could be adopted, like:\n\n- eMode for only WETH and stablecoins.\n- eMode for onboarding less mature LSTs, without requiring them being together with all major LSTs.\n\nFor extra configuration flexibility, liquid eModes also allow now to flag an asset as only borrowable, only collateral, or both, in the context of an eMode. For example, in a hypothetic eMode with only wstETH and WETH, the normal configuration would be wstETH as only collateral and WETH as only borrowable, fully focusing on the wstETH leverage use-case.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the previous main characteristics of liquid eModes, we have also introduced the following minor changes to the system:\n\n- Now the protocol doesn’t enforce the LTV/LT of an asset being lower outside its eligible eModes. However, the validation gets stricter on the user side when entering any eMode (or from no-eMode): Health Factor is always validated to never allow the user to get his position below 1HF post-eMode swap.\n- The protocol previously had an eMode-specific price feed, to be used to price with the same feed all assets on an eMode. However, this has never been used, and its utility (in its current form) is quite arguable. Therefore, we have to remove it from the data structure to allow more efficient storage allocation.\n- On a technical note, before 3.2, the eMode of an asset was stored on the asset’s data itself. Now, the eMode data stores all the necessary information for the protocol to understand which assets are eligible on that eMode.\n- Similar as with previous upgrades on Aave v3, we have tried to follow a non-invasive approach when adding the feature, only touching/refactoring those pieces that were clearly necessary, but without doing any big high-level refactoring of the pool.\n\n### 2 - Stable rate logic cleanup\n\nPart of the v.3.1 upgrade was the addition of a function swapToVariable() for anybody to permissionless off-board stable borrowings to variable, that way factually deprecating completely stable rate on Aave pools.\n\nWith currently no active stable rate position (moved via the Dolce Vita program by the service provider ACI 4), we have executed a follow-up step on the process: completely removing the stable rate logic from the protocol, which one hand simplifies the codebase, but on the other hand it also slightly optimises gas consumption and logic flows.\n\nEven if fairly extensive change, this cleanup is non-invasive in how the protocol operates given that there are no active stable rate positions. All technical details about it will be included in the upcoming v3.2 release technical changelog.\n\n## Security\nIn addition to all standard internal procedures on BGD Labs (testing, review), the external security processes are getting finished. Before the final AIP, they will be properly communicated in the Aave governance forum.\n\nSimilar as with any other Aave v3 upgrades, the AIP proposal will include compensation for the cost of the external security procedures.",

Even if this instance is not covered by the Aave Safety Module, being part of Aave, it still is monitored and evaluated whenever development and/or security decisions are made.\n\nThis creates meaningful overhead for all involved development & security teams, which directly adds cost to the Aave DAO. Additionally, the architecture of Aave v1 is quite different to Aave v2 & v3, making it the most ad-hoc instance of Aave.\n\nFor the previous reasons, we think the community should evaluate approving extra off-boarding steps.\n\n\n## Specification\nTo achieve a complete off-boarding of Aave v1, the following needs to be completed:\n\n- All debt has to be settled, in order to allow liquidity providers on v1 to withdraw.\n- All assets have to be withdrawn.\n\nTo minimise the impact on users we propose a phased approach, where each phase could last in the order of 1-3 weeks.\n\n### Phase 1\nIn a first phase we recommend to upgrade the liquidation mechanism on the protocol in the following ways:\n\n- It should no longer be possible to receive aTokens for liquidations (as the goal is to remove liquidity, not transfer it from user to user).\n- It should be possible to liquidate healthy (collateralised) positions with a fixed liquidationBonus (e.g. 1%). This value should be small to not hurt borrowers, while still being big enough to incentivise liquidations. If this Temp Check is successful, we will confirm the number with risk providers., but 1% at the current moment would make the liquidation profitable for approximately 85% of the positions to liquidate.\n- It should be possible to liquidate a entire position at once (currently on Aave v1 only 50% of a position can be liquidated).\n- Interest rates should be lowered to the minimum, as the previously described always-enabled dynamics remove any need of utilisation dynamics.\n- Remove flash loan fee, as there should not be extra incentives for liquidity providers.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn a second phase we recommend increasing the fixed liquidationBonus to a higher percentage.\n\nThe exact number must be chosen based on current market conditions to minimise user impact, but allow economical liquidations.\n\n### Phase 3\nOnce the big majority of debt is repaid, we recommend to introduce a forced withdrawal mechanism. With forced withdrawals anybody could withdraw on behalf of any liquidity provider on Aave v1, with the funds received by the holder of the aToken.\n\nIt is important to clarify that further technical aspects on this should be analysed before executing this step, for example smart contracts receiving funds without triggering a withdrawal.\n\n---\n\nAfter all the Phases are finished, additional ad-hoc steps can be executed, like Rescue Mission for locked funds.\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf this TEMP CHECK is approved, we will proceed with an ARFC, with the final steps including feedback from risk service providers, and precise technical decisions.\n\nFinally, AIPs will be created for the different phases.\n\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",
