This proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of the FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism liquidity pools.\n\nIf this proposal is implemented, all flashLoan fees for DeFi Saver users using Aave would be waived. The Aave-Chan initiative believes that any incurred lost potential revenue will be compensated by the increased competitiveness of the Aave protocol and the increased borrow volume.\n\nAbstract\n\nthis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.\n\nMotivation\nDeFi Saver has a long-standing history of synergies with the Aave Protocol, being one of the first third-party integrations of Aave V1 in 2020.\n\nCurrently, every flashloan has a 9 bps fee that rewards liquidity providers in Aave. While flashloans were created by Aave, the ecosystem as a whole has replicated this feature, and most protocols do not implement any fees.\n\nThe ACI does not support waiving the fees for flashloans in general, as we firmly believe that users’ funds used, even in the context of a single transaction, should be rewarded.\n\nHowever, some strategic use cases of V3, such as emode, are very fee-sensitive as they mobilize high leverage. Waiving the DeFi Saver flashloan fees is expected to make these strategies more convenient and profitable, leading to increased borrow volume and thus increased Aave DAO revenue.\n\nThis proposal presents Aave governance with the opportunity to whitelist DeFi Saver as a part of FlashBorrowers of Aave V3 on Ethereum, Arbitrum & Optimism liquidity pools.\n\nImplementation\nThis proposal aims to implement a single AIP, utilizing three similar payloads (one for each network), which will simply call addFlashBorrower() on the ACL_MANAGER contract.\n\nLimitation\nThis AIP grants permission to whitelist any DeFi Saver contract for all use cases, such as leveraged positions, EMODE, debt and collateral swaps, with one exception: no smart-contract that migrates a position outside of the Aave ecosystem is eligible for whitelisting.\n\nDisclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not associated with or compensated by DeFi Saver for publishing this AFRC.\n\nCopyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0,",

When a trader opens a position, the protocol borrows on the money market, swaps on the spot market, then lends back on the money market, allowing users to actively manage and take leveraged positions on Aave and other protocols.\n\n[Cian Protocol](https://cian.app/] is a decentralized automation platform that helps users onboard complex crypto delta-neutral yield strategies in one simple transaction.\n\n[Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/)is an EVM based protocol that enables easy access to complex DeFi strategies by translating them into ERC20 tokens.\n\nIf this proposal is implemented, all flashLoan fees for Contango Protocol, Cian Protocol and Index Coop users using Aave would be waived.\n\nThe Aave-Chan initiative believes that any incurred lost potential revenue will be compensated by the increased competitiveness of the Aave Protocol and the increased borrow volume.\n\nCurrently, every flashloan has a 9 bps fee that rewards liquidity providers in Aave. While flashloans were created by Aave, the ecosystem as a whole has replicated this feature, and most protocols do not implement any fees.\n\nThe ACI does not support waiving the fees for flashloans in general, as we firmly believe that users’ funds used, even in the context of a single transaction, should be rewarded.\n\nHowever, some strategic use cases of V3, such as emode, are very fee-sensitive as they mobilize high leverage.

At the time of writing the total market size of Aave v2 on Avalanche and Polygon is $36.2M and $134.7M respectively. For comparison, the Aave v3 deployment on each network is $199.8M and $229.9M respectively. \n\nBy removing SM coverage for Avalanche and Polygon v2 deployments, Aave DAO will no longer be providing coverage for the outdated iterations of Aave Protocol with exception of the Aave ARC deployment. By removing the SM coverage, users are further encouraged to migrate to v3.\n\nThe Polygon Aave v3 deployment is already covered by the SM whilst the Avalanche v3 deployment is not cover by the SM. This publication seeks to extend the SM coverage to include Avalanche v3. Therefore both v3 iterations are covered by the SM and v2 iterations are not covered on Polygon and Avalanche. \n\nFor reference, at the time of writing, the following Aave Protocol deployments are covered by the SM:\n\n* Ethereum v2\n* [Ethereum v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x2cbfeb5c5329c4d1720dbae4045386fceb2d2a9bd5b42a81cee47ea5c934f491)\n* [Polygon v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)\n* [Avalanche v2](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreiba2pdfwoesezgpedf37bjfgadxmaigavoulek5wayqb7f2tz6byy)\n* [Aave ARC](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/bafkreieeyh6pbqwhgryo6v67oxlmnfhaptrgkc3u7y6bvz2y3jdkxgrrh4)\n* [Polygon v3](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x7da4985b2d5b1cbe6bbc0992d5c86030cedef2013487e4b53b4244c315c90155)\n\n\n# Specification\n\nIt is important to note based upon the current implementation of the SM, an adhoc AIP is required to implement a Shortfall Event.\n\nThe following Snapshot votes will be created to enable granular voting:\n\n* Extend SM Coverage to Avalanche v3\n* Remove SM Coverage for Polygon v2\n* Remove SM Coverage for Avalanche v2\n\nUpon conclusion of the Snapshot vote, if approved, SM coverage will be removed/extended to the respective market.\n\nThere is no need for an AIP to implement this upgrade.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic receives no payment from Aave DAO or any external source for the creation of this proposal.

        "author": "0x329c54289Ff5D6B7b7daE13592C6B1EDA1543eD4",
        "body": "---\n## Title : [ARFC] wGHO Aave V3 Onboarding\n\n## Author : Marc Zeller @marczeller - Aave Chan Initiative, Chaos Labs\n\n## Date: 2023-09-15\n---\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to onboard wGHO, an ERC-20 token wrapper of GHO, as a collateral-only asset in a newly created stablecoin emode within the Aave V3 Ethereum pool. The integration will enable using wGHO as collateral to borrow other stablecoins, facilitating arbitrage and leveraged positions for under-peg GHO situations.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe onboarding of wGHO presents an opportunity to enhance the Aave ecosystem by allowing wGHO to be used as collateral for borrowing stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and LUSD.\n\nThis integration will enable arbitrage and leveraged positions in cases of under-peg GHO, providing the markets with tools to act on peg-deviation of GHO in both directions.\n\nAlongside the upcoming GHO PSM, this proposal will further strengthen the market's ability to maintain the GHO peg.\n\nIt's important to note that although wGHO is proposed as collateral in Aave V3, it will not be a collateral of GHO due to its collateral-only, isolation mode, and emode asset status.\n\nwGHO will only be available to borrow DAI, USDC, LUSD & USDT. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe ACI proposes the following parameters for the integration of wGHO into the Aave V3 Ethereum pool:\n\n- Onboard wGHO as a collateral-only asset & isolation mode asset.\n- wGHO parameters:\n\n| LTV | 77% |\n| --- | --- |\n| LT | 80%  |\n| Liquidation penalty | 4.5% |\n| Supply Cap | 1M |\n| Borrow Cap | 0 |\n| Debt Ceiling | 1M$ |\n\n### Note:\n\nwGHO is a simple ERC-20 wrapper around the GHO contract. A simple smart contract call allows anyone to wrap and unwrap GHO and wGHO making it as liquid and with the same risk profile of GHO.\n\nOnboarding wGHO instead of GHO, is due to technical implementation and risk isolation reasons. From the end-user perspective, wGHO & GHO are functionally equivalent. If this proposal is validated by governance, the UI frontend is invited to abstract this away.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe Aave Chan Initiative is not affiliated with or paid by any third parties to publish this ARFC. The he author have both large GHO debt & GHO holdings. The ACI uses GHO to fund the [Orbit program](https://governance.aave.com/t/introducing-orbit-a-delegate-platform-funding-initiative-by-aci/13241).\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Gather community feedback and consensus on this ARFC.\n2. Escalate this proposal to the ARFC Snapshot Stage.\n3. If Snapshot outcome is YAE approved, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
