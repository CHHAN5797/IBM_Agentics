        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] PYUSD Reserve Configuration Update & Incentive Campaign\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes amendments to the PYUSD Reserve in preparation for an upcoming incentive campaign.\n\nAdditionally, a co-incentive campaign is to be implemented to improve the PYUSD and GHO liquidity.\n\n# Motivation\n\nTrident Digital with support from PayPal, presents the Aave DAO with an opportunity to promote the adoption of PYUSD on Aave Protocol and PYUSD/GHO liquidity on Balancer for an initial 6 month period.\n\nEligible Aave Protocol users are expected to receive up to 4.00% APR in Liquidity Mining (LM) rewards made available by Trident Digital on behalf of PayPal.\n\nThe incentive program seeks to increase PYUSD deposits into Aave Protocol, targeting total deposits of 75M units. After achieving 75M units of aEthPYUSD circulating supply, the rewards budget is to be distributed pro-rata. \n\nTo prevent undesired rewards farming, an eligibility requirement is to be applied to discourage undesired behaviour. \n\nRewards are to be distributed as aEthPYUSD on a monthly basis via a merkle contract administered by the ACI team.\n\n## PYUSD Rewards\n\nPYUSD rewards are to be distributed at a fixed rate of 4.00% to eligible user on Aave v3 on Ethereum up to a threshold of 75M aEthPYUSD. After this threshold is achieved, rewards are to be distributed pro-rata to eligible users. \n\nEligible users can expect to earn the following rewards:\n\n* Deposit Yield from Aave Protocol\n* Additional 4.00% of [aEthPYUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C0d01AbF3e6aDfcA0989eBbA9d6e85dD58EaB1E)\n\nUsers actions are tracked with users to receive 4.00% APR x `Eligible Holding`\n\n*Note: This incentive program differs from others projects that measure Net PYUSD (deposits - debt) by inclusion of all aEthPYUSD in circulating supply.*\n\n**Eligibility Criteria**\n\nUsers are subject to the following eligibility criteria:\n\n`Eligible Holding` = `PYUSD aToken Holding`  - `Undesired Debt Token Holding` / `PYUSD Liquidation Threshold`\n\nUndesired Debt Token(s):\n\n* variableDebtEthPYUSD\n\nUsers who hold both the [aEthPYUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C0d01AbF3e6aDfcA0989eBbA9d6e85dD58EaB1E) deposit receipt token and the [variableDebtEthPYUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x57B67e4DE077085Fd0AF2174e9c14871BE664546) will be adversley affected as determine by the formula shown above.\n\nUpon launch of the program, the only `Undesired Debt Token Holding` is the PYUSD variable debt token. \n\n**Rewards Amendments**\n\nTrident Digital and PayPal reserve the right to amend the list of Undesired Debt Token(s). If any change is made, a comment will be shared below in the comments section informing users of the amendment to the rewards program.\n\nUpdates can only be made during the last week of each calendar month and are effective from the start of the following month.\n\n**Distribution of Rewards**\n\nDuring the first week of each new month, the @ACI team will distribute [aEthPYUSD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0C0d01AbF3e6aDfcA0989eBbA9d6e85dD58EaB1E) rewards via a Merkle contract. This approach follows the same rational as the Merit program.\n\n**PYUSD Reserve Parameter Adjustments**\n\nTo streamline communication, any risk or borrow rate parameter adjustment affecting the PYUSD reserve are to be agreed ahead of any change being implemented. Trident Digital is to represent PayPal's interest in providing the incentive budget. \n\nAave DAO's Risk Service Providers remain the ultimate decision maker(s) as to if the DAO supports any proposed amendment. \n\n## PYUSD/GHO Liquidity \n\nAs part of the PYUSD growth iniative, a 8M PYUSD/GHO Elliptic Liquidity Pool (ECLP) with an asymmetric concentrated liquidity profile will be used on Balancer.\n\nThe pool will be funded and supported for an initial 6 month period. \n\n**Budget**\n\nThe 8M of liquidity is expected to cost ~14% APR. This cost is to be split 50/50 with the Aave DAO to provide up to 300k GHO.\n\nEarly discussions with prospective Liquidity Provider(s) (LP) has indicated a preference for direct payment outside of the Balancer and Aura Gauges. Some prospective LPs are considering holding GHO debt whilst providing liquidity.

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Liquidity Committee Funding\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-02-29\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes funding the Aave Liquidity Committee with 500k GHO to continue supporting GHO's liquidity and DeFi integrations over the next 3 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince its initial [funding in October 2023](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/), the Aave Liquidity Committee (previously GLC) has actively supported GHO liquidity across various DEXes by deploying and incentivising liquidity pools.\n \nAs a result of these efforts:\n\n* Deeper on-chain liquidity\n* Lower slippage, especially for GHO to USDC swaps\n\nIn combination with other efforts like stkGHO, ALC's initiatives have played a critical role in supporting GHO's peg recovery.\n\nThroughout the period, the ALC leveraged on both Uniswap v3 and, more frequently, Maverick to tailor liquidity distribution at specific price ranges which helped absorb GHO downward market volatility. A list of active Boosted Positions can be found [here](https://app.mav.xyz/boosted-positions?chain=1).\n\nWhile some pools are incentivised by voting with pre-existing DAO holdings (e.g. vlAURA), others like Maverick's concentrated liquidity Boosted Positions require additional expenses. It is worth noting, the Aave DAO is expected to benefit from the next airdrop by Maverick. We expect Maverick, and potentially Merkle on Uniswap v3, to remain key tools for supporting tailored liquidity shaping efforts in provided peg resilience.\n\nConcentrated GHO liquidity was [recently introduced in Balancer](https://twitter.com/GyroStable/status/1757365157917815001) with the creation of several E-CLP pools. These pools are being jointly incentivised with use to the Aave DAO's vlAURA holding. When there is excess vlAURA votes, these votes have been delegated to Paladin in return for approximately 70% APR nominated in USDC. \n\nThe following charts depict some of the impact these efforts had on GHO's ecosystem, highlights:\n\n* GHO/USDC Maverick pools captured most of the volume \n    * 0.2% bin width pool processed most of the volume during high volatility period\n    * 0.1% bin width pool is starting to replace the 0.2% bin width pool trading volume. This is due to incentive efforts shifting to Boosted Positions within the 0.1% bin width pool to create deeper liquidity and reducing price volatility \n*  GHO/USDC/USDT Balancer provides continuous yield source for LP\n    *  Trading volumes and TVL on Balancer are expected to increase when the BPT is integrated by [other protocols](https://twitter.com/Matthew_Graham_/status/1762076544241955070) and leveraged farming is introduced\n* Gyrsocope E-CLP pools on Balancer are starting to capture a larger share of the market volume in recent weeks\n    *  As the peg improves, one pool will be retained and the dual token deposit requirement will help provide resilience for the peg\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiex2m345ibzurmui7f3vz7l5w23sv53ej6fj5tppcqcphfsf3p2l4)\nSource: [karpatkey - Dune Analytics - ](https://dune.com/karpatkey/gho-debt-and-token-metrics)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreib2sefybdb73e7g4wksg7mk5wlj3ul53plmw3hrpbmpltn3wlxzu4)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-pools)\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiabucrlngizdmx25lzi23uorxsgkzoxm6da7tksdmhnw7cbpqqvue)\nSource: [TokenLogic - GHO Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/liquidity-committee)\n\nThe next chapter for GHO focuses on the following key areas:\n\n* 1.00:1.00 peg with USD \n* Reducing price volatility\n* Deeper liquidity to support DeFi integrations\n* Grow non stable-coin-paired liquidity pools\n* Targeted liquidity distributions to support Borrow Cap increases\n\nThese efforts will need to scale to match GHO's expected growth profile. The primary liquidity pools are to remain stable coins, and we expect to introduce other asset pairs in the future, as well as participation in the launch of various projects like [Ethena](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and [f(x) Protocol's launch](https://x.com/protocol_fx/status/1762822716854354015?s=20). \n\nThough there is inherent uncertainty in future stable coin rates, price volatility, and upcoming opportunities for new DeFi integrations, we believe a high-level budget will look like the following:\n\n| Objective | Category | Budget   |\n| --------  | --------  | -------- |\n| Liquidity | Peg Resilience | 360k GHO |\n| DeFi Integrations  | Create Utility  |  140k GHO |\n|Total| | 500k GHO|\n\nIt is important to note that this estimation excludes efforts to drive GHO liquidity or integrations beyond Ethereum.\n\n# Performance Indicators\n\nThe below details some high level GHO metrics we propose tracking:\n\n| Description| Optimal Value|\n| --------  | --------  |\n| TVL DEX Liquidity Pools | 50M |\n| TVL in Utility Liquidity Pools  | 15M excl. stkGHO  |\n| DEX Liquidity Composition | < 50% GHO (< 33% for 3pools)  |\n| Swap Price Impact $5M Swap | < 0.10%  (GHO to USDC)|\n| Annualised Peg Volatility | < 5.00%  |\n| Price level for > 90% time   | $0.995 using [Redstone Medium Price](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/GHO)  |\n\nPlease note, each of the above targets has external dependencies beyond the control of the ALC. The above table serves as a North Star for the ALC to strive towards over the next 3 months on the assumption the Borrow Cap is continually increased beyond the current 35M Bucket Size. Having measurable targets provides a clear direction and goal to achieve.\n\nThe [stkGHO implementation](https://app.aave.com/staking), [USDe integration](https://app.ethena.fi/liquidity) and coordinated efforts to attract users to acquire GHO are all great examples of how growth initiatives drive GHO utility, adoption and have a positive impact the spot price. \n\nEach of the above metrics, plus more, will be shown on the TokenLogic analytics dashboard.\n\n# Specification\n\nSwap the following assets for GHO:\n\n* 250k aUSDT\n* 250k aUSDC\n\nCreate an allowance for 500k GHO.\n\nALC SAFE: `0x205e795336610f5131Be52F09218AF19f0f3eC60`\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. Gather feedback from the community.\n1. If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n1. If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Funding Update\nauthor: \n@TokenLogic - @MatthewGraham, @scottincrypto \n@r3genFinance - @Elliott_r3gen, @Pepperoni_Jo3_r3gen\ncreated: 2023-10-23\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis publication proposes updating Aave DAO's stable coin holdings in preparation for the emergence of several service provider proposals. Upon implementation, the DAO will be sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe below outlines the current service provider and delegate nominated expenses.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJC8KSOzT.png)\n\nThe is also a maximum [$1M USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cst5Kx0N2t4PfyNAEpobH6dWUE2JKfo49dSjRMhelfY/edit) bounty program with Immunefi to be aware of.\n\nIn the near future, Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, we expect new proposals to emerge in the following areas:\n\n* Security (Certora, Sigma)\n* Risk (Chaos Labs, Gauntlet) \n* Financial Service Providers ([numerous](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-financial-management-working-group/15193))\n* Marketing (Aave Companies)\n* Delegates (6 teams)\n* Liquidity Committee (GLC)\n\nAssuming the DAO continues migrating service providers to GHO and stops using AAVE as a form of payment outside of the SM, the DAO will require additional GHO.\n\nThe GHO Stability Module (GSM) is some weeks away from being production ready and this proposal intends to sufficiently capitalise the DAO in preparation for receiving several service provider proposals in the areas mentioned above.\n\nThe previous [GHO Funding Proposal](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/?proposalId=347) is sufficient to cover the following:\n\n* $375k ACI (6 months)\n* $180k Delegate Funding (6 months)\n* $616k Aave Grants DAO (6 months)\n* $550k Aave Companies (3 months)\n\nTotal: $1,721k GHO\n\nThe DAO holds [1,226,040.11 GHO](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f?a=0x464c71f6c2f760dda6093dcb91c24c39e5d6e18c) with the [TUSD and BUSD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/) assets still to be swapped ot GHO. When these swaps have been executed, there is enough GHO to cover the above expenses but not sufficient to onboard future service providers.\n\nThis proposal intends to ensure the DAO is well capitalised. A separate DAO budget publication will be shared during Q4 2023.\n\nThe DAO has sufficient USDC, DAI and USDT deposited across the various instances of Aave Protocol to support existing streams and the [AURA purchase](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-enhancing-aave-daos-liquidity-incentive-strategy-on-balancer/15061).\n\nHowever, with the emergence of new service provider proposal expected, the DAO needs to adjust its stable coin holdings. Ths publication supports transferring additional funds from Polygon to Mainnet and acquiring GHO on the market to ensure the DAO  is well capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\n## Security Service Providers\n\nAave DAO's 2H 2023 Security budget consisted of the last 3 months of Certora's 10 month stream, the last month of Sigma's 12 month stream and the adhoc Sigma funding proposal for the audit of Governance v3, a.DI and GSM.\n\n* [Certora](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/114/) 10 months Nov 22 to Sep 23 ($2,700,000 USD equivalent)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/88/) 12 months Jul 22 to Jul 23 ($1,296,000 USD)\n* [Sigma](https://app-aave-com.ipns.dweb.link/governance/proposal/313/) Gov v3, a.DI and GSM during Q3 to Q4 2023 ($162k)\n\nThis proposal assumes the DAO will receive a 12 month proposal from Certora and will continue to use Sigma on an adhoc basis. \n\nFor the next 6 months, we propose having $1.5M of funds available for Security service providers. We expect this budget to not include AAVE, and to include DAI and GHO.\n\n## Bug Bounty Program\n\nThe Aave DAO has a [$1M USD](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/325) bug bounty program with Immunefi. It is important the DAO has sufficient funds available, if ever they are needed.\n\n## Risk Service Providers\n\nDuring 2023, the Risk Service provider budget was $3.5M nominated in AAVE, aUSDC and aEthUSDT. Going forward we expect this to be nominated in aUSDT and GHO, provided the community aligns with this approach. The most recent Chaos Labs proposal was nominated solely in aEthUSDT and we have received feedback future proposals are to exclude AAVE.\n\nBased upon our discussions, we anticipate the overall risk budget for the next 12 months being approximately $2.5M assuming both service providers are retained by the DAO.\n\n## Voting Service Providers\n\nThe current Orbit program has 6 participating delegates. This proposal makes allowance for 6 delegates to continue receiving funding. At $5k per month, this is 360k of GHO per year.\n\nWe note, @EzR3aL is expected to emerge as a paid delegate and at least one delegate will progress to being a service provider. It is very possible the number of paid delegates decreases over time and if so, the GHO can be reassigned.\n\n## Financial Service Providers\n\nA budget of $400k is proposed for the next 6 months. This is $50k more than the TokenLogic funding proposal and should be sufficient to encourage other bids to emerge. \n\n** Disclosure: TokenLogic intends to pursue becoming a service provider in this area. Our previous proposal was $350k spanning 6 months.**\n\n## Marketing Service Provider\n\nCurrently performed by @AaveCompanies at the rate of 550k per 3 months. The previous 6 month grant period spend approximate [950k USD](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-updated-aave-grants-continuation-proposal/14951) on events and marketing. The Aave brand and swag is renowned across the industry. There are no proposed changes to the average 500k USD per quarter spend rate.\n\n## GHO Liquidity Committee\n\nThe GLC is expected to continue beyond the initial 3 months duration. For the purpose of this publication, it is assumed the GLC will require similar funding during the next 3 month funding cycle.\n\n$450k in GHO has been allocated to this initiative which is $50k more than the current funding rate. \n\n## Growth Service Provider\n\nThe ACI team with $375k GHO. Supported by existing GHO holdings.\n\n## Development Service Provider\n\nThe @bgdlabs team with <2k AAVE and <630k aEthDAI remaining on the current 6 month stream. Supported by existing DAI on Aave v3 Ethereum holdings.\n\n## Aave Grants DAO Service Provider\n\nThe AGD team is currently funded with the 616k GHO, 612k aUSDT and $400k in ARB for the next 6 months. Supported by existing GHO and aUSDT (v2) holdings.\n\n## Safety Module\n\nExpenses relating to the Safety Module (SM) have been omitted. Currently, the SM is funded with AAVE emissions. If the DAO was to upgrade the SM in the near future, it is unclear if that will happen within the next 6 months. As a result, any bribe / quest funding request will be managed separately.\n\n## Funding\n\nOver the next 6 months, the DAO should be sufficiently well capitalised to accommodate the emergence of the following expenses:\n\n* $1.5M - Security (6 months)\n* $1.25M - Risk (6 months)\n* $1.0M - Bug Bounty (unknown)\n* $0.5M - Marketing (3 months)\n* $0.4M - Financial Services (6 months)\n* $0.45M - GHO Liquidity Committee (3 months)\n\nTotal: 5.1M USD\n\nAll Financial Services, Marketing and Liquidity Committee expenses are to be nominated in GHO. \n\nRisk and Security allocation can be nominated in any of the following aEthDAI or aETHUSDT or GHO. A separate proposal can adjust the asset composition if any amendments are required. Alternatively, the future GLC proposal can swap assets to GHO upon being renewed.\n\nThere is 1.5M of DAI already being transferred from [PR339 - Polygon to Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/339). 1M of this can be deposited into Aave v3, the aDAI on Aave v2 can be redeemed and deposited into v3 and net BGD stream allocation is 1.34M aEthDAI. An additional 0.5M can be transferred from Polygon to Ethereum increasing the overal aEthDAI holding to 1.84M aEthDAI for future expenses.\n\nThe ACI aUSDT stream is now complete and only the AGD allowance, 613k, remains. Therefore, of the1.03M of aUSDT in Aave v2, leaving 0.7M for AGD to draw down 0.613M from, 0.33M (at time of writing) can be migrated to Aave v3. There is 0.4M aEthUSDT in Aave v3 with 0.23M aEthUSDT allocated to Chaos Labs. Net transfer of aUSDT and unallocated aEthUSDT is 0.50M aEthUSDT. Transfer 0.75M of USDT from Polygon to Ethereum increases the available USDT on Ethereum to 1.25M aEthUSDT.\n\nAn additional 1.0M USDC from Polygon is to be transferred to Ethereum to ensure the Immunefi bug bounty program has sufficient funds available if required.\n\nAdditional funds will be required to cover the full amount of expenses mentioned above. This proposal will start moving Aave in the right direction.\n\n# Specification\n\nThis proposal will perform the following tasks on Ethereum:\n\n* Deposit 1M units of DAI from Treasury into Aave v3, aEthDAI\n* Migrate all but 0.7M aUSDT from Aave v2 to v3, aEthUSDT (0.33M units at time of writing)\n* Migrate all aDAI from Aave v2 to v3, aEthDAI (470k units at time of writing)\n\nSwap the following asset holdings to GHO:\n\n* All Aave ARC aUSDC (56,843.44 units at time of writing)\n* All GUSD (18,464.03 units at time of writing)\n* All available aTUSD that can be redeemed (57,373.85 units at time of writing)\n* All UST (893,257.63 units at time of writing)\n* 500k units of DAI held in Treasury (on route from Polygon)\n\nBridge the following assets from Polygon to Ethereum:\n\n* Redeem and transfer 1.7M USDC to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.5M DAI to Ethereum Treasury\n* Redeem and transfer 0.75M USDT to Ethereum Treasury\n\nThe USDC bridged from Polygon can neither be swapped nor deposited into Aave v3 in a single AIP submission. A second AIP will perform the following:\n\n* Deposit 0.5M DAI into Aave v3\n* Deposit 0.75M USDT into Aave v3\n* Deposit 1.0M USDC into Aave v3\n* Swap 700k USDC to GHO\n\nUpon implementing the second AIP, the following funds will be available to support new expenses:\n\n* More than 1.25M of aEthUSDT (Migration v2 to v3, Polygon Transfer, Net Chaos Labs stream)\n* More than 1.8M of aEthDAI (Migration v2 to v3, Deposit, Polygon Transfer, Net BGD Stream)\n* More than 1.5M of GHO (Swap assets to GHO, net current known expenses)\n* More than 1.0M of aEthUSDC (Polygon Transfer)\n\nThe above takes into consideration current streaming contract obligations and proposals already advancing through governance. \n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\nWhilst we advocate for having 12 months on runway readily available in the right asset configuration. The priority is to ensure the DAO is sufficiently capitalised for the next 6 months.\n\nAs mentioned within the proposal, during Q4 2023, a publication relating to the DAOs overal budget allocation will be shared.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic receives no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic is a delegate within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

This publication catalogs TokenLogic's past and ongoing involvements with the Aave DAO, acknowledging the team's valuable contributions while also establishing a path for a seamless transition in alignment with the outcome of the Request For Proposal process.\n\nThe lists below encompass most of our contributions thus far, excluding efforts on projects that didn't materialize. Additionally, we have outlined a limited scope of forthcoming work that we intend to undertake as part of this funding proposal.\n\n## 15 Submitted AIPs\n\n* [AIP-354 - Transfer Assets From Polygon to Ethereum Treasury](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/?proposalId=354)\n* [AIP-353 - Reserve Update October](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/?proposalId=353)\n* [AIP-347 - GHO Funding](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/347/)\n* [AIP-343 - Fund GHO Liquidity Committee](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/343/)\n* [AIP-334 - Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/334/)\n* [AIP-333 - Treasury Management - Create AGD GHO Allowance](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/333/)\n* [AIP-328 - Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/328/)\n* [AIP-312 - Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/312/)\n* [Guardian - Treasury Management - Avalanche v2 to v3 Migiration](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/304/)\n* [AIP-303 - Treasury Management - Polygon v2 to v3 Migration](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/303/) this requires a rerun\n* [AIP-300 - stMATIC Supply Cap](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/300/)\n* [AIP-284 - Reserve Factor Updates - Polygon Aave v2](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/284/)\n* [AIP-273 - Add ARB to Aave V3 Arbitrum Pool](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/273/)\n* [AIP-260 - Add FRAX Ethereum Aave v3](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/260/)\n* [AIP-259 - Add FRAX Arbitrum Aave v3](http://app-aave-com.ipns.localhost:48084/governance/proposal/259/)\n* [AIP Polygon v2 - Parameter Update](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/250/)\n\n## 8-9 Planned AIPs\n\n* 2-3 AIPs relating to [DAO's runway](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194)\n* 1 AIP [acquiring rETH](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x80493cdca3b1893e198802cd245e6e3c00f5fcd0b37c09aa41765b17419a71fe)\n* 1 AIP to migrate Polygon Treasury from v2 to v3\n* 2 AIPs increasing [RF on Polygon v2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-reserve-factor-updates-polygon-aave-v2/13937/8)\n* 1 AIP to upgrade SAM for [vlAURA holding](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-vlaura/15323)\n\n## 5 ARFC \n\n* [ARFC Safety Module - Polygon & Avalanche Coverage Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-safety-module-polygon-avalanche-coverage-update/14810)\n* [ARFC Treasury Management - Amend Safety Module AAVE Emissions](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-amend-safety-module-aave-emissions/14936)\n* [ARFC Treasury Management - GHO Liquidity Strategy Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-gho-liquidity-strategy-update/14801)\n* [ARFC Treasury Management - Acquire AURA](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-treasury-management-acquire-aura/14683)\n* [ARFC Aave Funding Update](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-funding-update/15194)\n\n## 7 Proposals Beyond Aave\n\n* [SIPS-084 Turbo GHO Co-Incentives](https://community.sommelier.finance/t/sips-084-turbo-gho-co-incentives/1194)\n * [BIP-357 Enable GHO/LUSD Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-357-enable-gho-lusd-gauge-ethereum/4963)\n * [BIP-360 Enable GHO/bb-a-USD Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-360-enable-gho-bb-a-usd-gauge-ethereum/4965)\n * [BIP-413 Kill GHO Gauges Week 35](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-413-kill-gho-gauges-week-35/5144)\n * [BIP-358 Enable GHO/wstETH Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-358-enable-gho-wsteth-gauge-ethereum/4964)\n * [BIP-411 Enable GHO/USDT/USDC Gauge [Ethereum]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-411-enable-gho-usdt-usdc-gauge-ethereum/5135)\n * [TRC-92 - Enable GHO/USDC Gauge](https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/13698-trc92-enable-ghousdc-gauge-no-cap)\n* [ TRC-102 Enable GHO/USDC Gauge [Ethereum]](https://gov.timelessfi.com/discussion/13900-trc102-enable-ghousdc-gauge-ethereum)\n\n## Analytics Platform\n\n* [GHO Analytics Dashboard](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/)\n\nFurther details about this initiative can be found [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gho-analytics-by-tokenlogic/14067). \n\n## GHO Launch Support\n\nTokenLogic coordinated the BAL and AURA incentives to support launching GHO on Balancer.\n\nThe table below provides a conservative estimate of the value of the voting support:\n\n|Asset|Amount|Duration|Quest Price| Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|vlAURA| 400,000|12 weeks|$0.0085|$40,800|\n|veBAL|165,000|12 weeks|$0.045|$89,100|\n\nThe Aura Finance team extended their support with 400,000 vlAURA for a duration of three months. In the initial weeks, dedicated members of the Balancer community contributed over 4% of the veBAL supply. The table provided above is based on an assumption that accounts for 2.5% of veBAL supply in July and considers the current veBAL Quest price. It's important to note that this data underestimates the actual value of the votes that TokenLogic procured and offers significant context for readers.\n\nIt's important to note that some voters may have opted to support GHO pools independently, without requiring active engagement from the Aave community.\n\n# Terms\n\nWe request an additional $115k for the work detailed above, bringing the total compensation to $130k.\n\nThis figure was derived from wages and software licenses used to support hosting the GHO Analytics platform.\n\n# Specification\n\nIf this proposal is approved, the amount is to be transferred to a TokenLogic-controlled account (`0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`) as the recipient.\n\nThe transfer will be equivalent to $115k USD in GHO.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) If consensus on ARFC stage is reached, escalate to ARFC snapshot stage.\n2) If ARFC snapshot stage outcome is YAE, escalate to AIP stage.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Finance Steward\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-05-03\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nBuilding upon the success of the [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-risk-steward-phase-1-capsplusrisksteward/12602), this publication proposes creating a smart contract to enable \"Finance Stewards\" to execute on behalf of the DAO pre-approved and budgeted operations.\n\nThis proposal also marks a step forward in defining the asset management framework for Aave DAO, as introduced in the TokenLogic and karpatkey service provider [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).\n\n# Motivation\n\nTo progressively streamline the management of the Aave DAO's funds by shifting approved ARFC proposals from on-chain vote to a trusted Finance Steward implementation.\n\nThe Finance Steward is a smart contract that will act as admin of the collector, it can do the exact same operations as the DAO Executor. The DAO has full ownership of the contract which grants it the ability to delegate permissions and budget specific actions to a Guardian, the Finance team. \n\nThe Finance Steward will enable the DAO to define a core set of financial capabilities to be carried out within strict role-based guardrails. As the role matures or new use cases arise, we plan to bring forward additional capabilities for the DAO to discuss.\n\nEfforts not included in the Finance Steward or being developed will still be covered through the normal governance process. This may include the recommendation to introduce purpose-specific safe multisigs with the intent to minimise governance burden (e.g. ALC, APE, etc…).  This design will map frequent key finance operations to a role-based governance-controlled solution, frequent but long-tail use cases to trust-minimised and efficient multisigs; and important, infrequent or strategic discussions to the full governance process.\n\n\nIt is relatively simple for the Aave DAO to grant granular control over the management of various parameters to Finance Stewards, but the complexity comes in term of decentralisation and self-protection of the protocol.\n\nThe initial introduction of the Finance Steward role will enable the tasks detailed in the Specifications to be performed. \n\n# Specification\n\n## Finance Steward v1.0 (Mainnet Only)\n\nThe initial Finance Steward implementation will work the following way:\n\n* A `FinanceSteward` smart contract will be created with an Owner and a Guardian. The Owner will be the DAO.\n* Guardian of the FinanceSteward contract will be a multisig with multiple signers, to be determined by the DAO.\n* The Collector Contract will be upgraded to have a system of roles whereby the same admin role can be held by multiple addresses, eg: FUNDS_ADMIN by the DAO's Executor and the FINANCE_STEWARD by the multisig proposed earlier.\n* Guardian can migrate assets from v2 and deposit into v3 to support seamless migration of the DAOs assets over time.\n* Guardian can be granted the ability to use the Aave Swapper to exchange assets held in the Treasury\n* Guardian can withdraw and deposit into V3.\n* Guardian can be granted the ability to transfer and stream tokens to pre-approved addresses within a budget, for example:\n    * ACI [Frontier](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-introducing-frontier-staking-as-a-service-for-the-aave-dao/16225) Program\n    * ACI [Merit](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-a-new-aave-alignment-user-reward-system/16646) Program\n\nThe functionality will have the following limitations, enforced on-chain:\n\n* For each Aave market reserve, a [minimum balance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aaysvP2velw0hCBhH3huplumNwuN0FaA_bAZZTdjsmg/edit?usp=sharing) will remain in the collector\n* Tokens to swap to will be pre-approved by the DAO\n* Addresses to transfer to will be pre-approved\n* Tokens to transfer out of the Collector have a pre-defined budget set by the DAO\n\n## Future Phased Functionality Introduction\n\nThe following permissioned functionality is intended to be gradually introduced over time to further streamline the implementation of the DAO's financial transactions.\n\n* AAVE Protocol interactions in cross-chain deployments\n* Bridging from and to other chains\n\nSome of the above updates are pending other contracts to be delivered.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
