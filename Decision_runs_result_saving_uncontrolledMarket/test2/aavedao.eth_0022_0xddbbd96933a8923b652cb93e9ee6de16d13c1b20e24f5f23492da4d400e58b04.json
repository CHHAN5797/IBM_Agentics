        "body": "## [TEMP CHECK] Onboard SolvBTC to Aave V3 BOB Instance\n## Date: 2025-06-23\n## Author: Solv Protocol & ACI\n---\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to onboard SolvBTC to Aave V3 BOB Instance, once it's live, if [[ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on BOB ](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-deploy-aave-v3-on-bob/20544) eventually pass and is live.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSolv Protocol is the on-chain Bitcoin Reserve, bridging TradFi, CeFi, and DeFi to unlock the full potential of over $1 trillion in Bitcoin. Through SolvBTC and SolvBTC.LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens), Solv enables both retail and institutional investors to generate returns on their Bitcoin, turning it from an idle asset into a yield-generating instrument that seamlessly integrates with the broader financial ecosystem, driving the next era of Bitcoin Finance.\n\nSolv Protocol is backed by prominent investors such as Binance Labs, Blockchain Capital, Laser Digital, OKX Ventures, and others. Solv Protocol has undergone extensive security audits by leading firms, including Quantstamp, Certik, SlowMist, Salus, and Secbit.\n\n**About SolvBTC**\n\nSolvBTC, is a token representation of Bitcoin kept in Solv’s Bitcoin Reserves(the Initial Reserves includes BTCB & native BTC only), where it allows Bitcoin liquidity to seamlessly flow across various chains, breaking down inter-chain barriers and providing crucial liquidity infrastructure for the entire Bitcoin-powered finance (BTCFi) ecosystem.\n\nDeployed on more than ten networks like Bitcoin mainnet, Ethereum mainnet, BNB Chain, Berachain, AVAX and BOB,  SolvBTC is a key liquidity provider with over 20,000 BTC kept in its reserves. Our robust liquidity has attracted many key players in the DeFi world to partner and build using SolvBTC. Among them include Bitcoin Staking protocol Babylon, Synthetic Dollar Stablecoin Protocol Ethena, Jupiter on Solana, GMX on Arbitrum and many other projects.\n\n\n### Benefits to onboarding SolvBTC\n\nIntegrating SolvBTC as collateral on AAVE V3 on BOB will offer several benefits:\n\n1. Enhanced Liquidity\n\nSolvBTC will boost liquidity and trading volumes, due to the various yield opportunities built upon the SolvBTC ecosystem, including Solv RP, DeFi yields\n\n2. Increased Yield Opportunities:\n\nWith AAVE v3 on BOB supporting SolvBTC as collateral, users can leverage their SolvBTC holdings to maximize returns from AAVE’s lending and borrowing features, driving higher returns for WBTC lending.\n\n3. Innovative DeFi Strategies:\n\nSupport from AAVE v3 on BOB will foster the development of new DeFi strategies for WBTC and SolvBTC, increasing demand for both supplying and borrowing WBTC. Similar cases can already be seen on lending protocols of other L2s, where users lend their xSolvBTC (LST built on top of SolvBTC), to borrow more SolvBTC, and looping for more yields. This resulted in higher protocol fees for those lending protocols due to higher borrowing rates.\n\n4. Solv Points Incentives:\n\nTo mark the launch, users can earn Solv RP with a 6x multiplier by lending xSolvBTC — the highest multiplier ever offered — during an exclusive one-month boosting campaign.\n\nSolv Points System Portal: https://app.solv.finance/points\n\nDEFI Page: https://app.solv.finance/defi\n\nThese benefits are aligned with similar successful integrations on other lending protocols in the DeFi space, where SolvBTC has enabled users to enhance their yield opportunities and drive higher protocol fees.\n\nIntegrating SolvBTC into AAVE V3 on BOB represents a strategic opportunity for Solv, AAVE and BOB Chain. This partnership will enhance liquidity, attract new users, and drive innovative DeFi strategies within the BOB Chain ecosystem. By combining SolvBTC’s robust liquidity with AAVE’s lending capabilities, we can foster significant growth and reinforce our leadership in the DeFi and BTC-Fi sectors.\n\n## Specification\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n### Asset Overview\n\n* Token Name: SolvBTC\n* Token Symbol: SolvBTC\n* Contract Address on BOB: 0x541fd749419ca806a8bc7da8ac23d346f2df8b77\n\nChainlink Oracle: details incoming\n\n### Useful links\n\n* POR: https://data.chain.link/feeds/bsc/mainnet/solv-por\n* Audits: https://github.com/solv-finance/Audit\n* Official Website: https://app.solv.finance/solvbtc\n* Documentation: https://docs.solv.finance/\n* Github: https://github.com/solv-finance\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not directly affiliated with Solv Protocol or BOB Foundation and did not receive compensation related to this proposal.\n\n## **Next Steps**\n\n1. Publication of this TEMP CHECK and escalation to TEMP CHECK Snapshot. \n2. If 1 pass, publish an ARFC to continue gathering community and Service Providers feedback and escalate to ARFC Snapshot.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [ARFC] Onboard artMETIS to Aave V3 on Metis Market \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-06-26\n\n---\n\n# **Summary**\nThis proposal suggests onboarding artMETIS, the LST for METIS token as collateral on Aave v3 on Metis market. \n\n### **Motivation**\n\nArtemis is a liquid staking protocol launched in Feb 2024 that enables users to stake their METIS token and participate in the decentralized Sequencer staking. It is the largest LST protocol and the 3rd highest TVL protocol on the Metis network. artMETIS is a liquid wrapper of the staked METIS on Artemis and accrues the staking rewards directly. Therefore, 1 artMETIS can always be redeemed to more than 1 METIS.\n\nartMETIS liquidity is concentrated in artMETIS/METIS pair on Hercules, allowing for swap of 100 artMETIS to METIS with less than 0.5% slippage. The pool TVL currently has $3.43M and is available [here](https://app.hercules.exchange/pools/0xfd1F58C4c05d8Ed5040eE9bA7eDb5Cc5bf53930E).\n\nartMETIS can also be utilized as collateral on [Shoebill](https://metis-metis.shoebill.finance/#/) METIS market, enabling users to borrow assets and access liquidity by leveraging their artMETIS holdings. artMETIS is the top supply asset on Shoebill with over $3 million TVL.\n\n### Benefits of listing artMETIS\n\nWe believe that listing artMETIS will bring significant benefits to all parties involved and is a strategic decision that aligns with the goals of Aave.\n\n- Increased liquidity. The addition of artMETIS introduces an opportunity for users to borrow and lend LSTs.\n- Market expansion and user adoption. The listing of artMETIS has the potential to attract new users to the Aave platform.\n- Leveraged lending is a crucial use case for lending platforms. It not only brings more TVL and users to the platform but also significantly incentivizes genuine lending activity. This, in turn, generates more fee revenue for the project.\n- AAVE's artMETIS assets will receive an additional weekly incentive of $5000-$10000 in oMETIS (Option Metis), along with an extra 1X ART Points. These points will be eligible for future Artemis airdrops.\n\n### Chain to be deployed/listed\n\nartMETIS will be listed on Aave V3 Metis market with the following specifications.\n\nTicker: artMETIS\n\nContract Address: [0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d](https://andromeda-explorer.metis.io/address/0x2583A2538272f31e9A15dD12A432B8C96Ab4821d)\n\nChainlink Oracle: 0x96C4A48Abdf781e9c931cfA92EC0167Ba219ad8E\n\n### Specification\n\nRisk Parameters have been provided at ARFC stage by Risk Service Providers.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Isolation Mode | No |\n| Borrowable | Yes |\n| Collateral Enabled | Yes |\n| Supply Cap  | 15,000 |\n| Borrow Cap | 1,500 |\n| Debt Ceiling | - |\n| LTV | 30.00% |\n| LT | 40.00% |\n| Liquidation Bonus | 7.50% |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee | 10.00% |\n| Reserve Factor | 20.00% |\n| Variable Base | 0.0% |\n| Variable Slope1 | 7.00% |\n| Variable Slope2 | 300.00% |\n| Uoptimal | 45.00% |\n| Flahloanable | Yes |\n| Siloed Borrowing | No |\n| Borrowed in Isolation | No |\n\n\n### Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:\n\nThe Metis Foundation has shown strong commitment to supporting Artemis by committing 10k METIS and 10k artMETIS tokens to provide liquidity on Hercules DEX.\n\nFurthermore, the launch of Metis sequencers has sparked interest from institutional investors who are looking to invest and stake the METIS token. Artemis, as a leading liquid staking protocol for METIS, has actively engaged with these investors and successfully onboarded them to stake their METIS tokens with Artemis.\n\nArtemis has implemented a points system that incentivizes the initial liquidity bootstrap and user activity on various platforms. By supplying and borrowing artMETIS tokens on Aave, users can earn additional points and become eligible for the Artemis token airdrop.\n\nIn recognition of Artemis's efforts, the Metis Foundation has provided official grants to support the development of DeFi use cases for artMETIS. Part of this grant will be allocated to incentivize users on Aave.\n\nIn summary, the commitment of the Metis Foundation to provide initial liquidity, collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, implementation of liquidity mining programs, support for staking and yield farming opportunities, and the provision of grants to incentivize the user activity on Aave all contribute to a strong proof of liquidity and deposit commitments. These factors demonstrate the significant value and potential growth that the listing of artMETIS can bring to the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n[Website](https://artemisfinance.io)\n\n[X](https://x.com/Artemisfinance)\n\nDocuments:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/)\n\nAudit Report:\n\n[https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit](https://docs.artemisfinance.io/audit)\n\nDefillama:\n\nhttps://defillama.com/protocol/artemis-finance\n\n### Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.
