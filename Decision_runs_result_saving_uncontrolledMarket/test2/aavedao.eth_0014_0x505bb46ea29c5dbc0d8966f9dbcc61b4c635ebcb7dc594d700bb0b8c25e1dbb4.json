        "body": "# Simple Summary\n\nAs a continuation of the engagement that finished on 1st April 2025, present to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as a development and security coordinator services provider during the next 6 months.\n\n---\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn our role as technical services providers of an ecosystem like the Aave DAO, the context before we request renewal ideally is very simple: Aave has remained secure and competitive in the number one spot in DeFi, while little by little improving on all aspects in which we (BGD) have been involved.\n\nFrom that perspective, compared with 6 months ago:\n\n- We think Aave v3 is more technically sound, even considering a very high starting point. v3.3 has improved the protocol, and the upcoming v3.4 will do it even more.\n- The whole Aave ecosystem kept expanding to the networks.\n- New types of assets have been onboarded, and procedures on this have only improved.\n- A lot of groundwork has been done for an even brighter future, from all angles. Testimony of that is, for example, the activation of SVR to recapture liquidations value, or Umbrella being ready for integration with all other Aave systems.\n- Service providers’ coordination has continuously improved, and the DAO is now a very efficient decentralised organisation, not sacrificing quality.\n\nSame time, the DAO is going into very new directions, like the upcoming v4 by AaveLabs, Umbrella having a core role in the ecosystem, or the new Aavenomics, amongst others.\nGiven that our objective has always been giving value to Aave in those places where we believe it is worth it, our new scope presented here naturally has evolved due to that.\n\n---\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## **Aave <> BGD Phase V scope**\n\nOur proposed scope of services includes the following:\n\n- **Activation of v3.4 plus improvements on top**. As commented on the [v3.4](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-bgd-aave-v3-4/21572) upgrade thread, we think that high-level everything included there is a net improvement of the protocol, even considering the final refinement of the features we are now performing [post-ARFC approval](https://snapshot.box/#/s:aavedao.eth/proposal/0xbbdd44ff07184dc17b9215414f5bb747a48c19e699c7505df35a7e1ca54e9da6).\nIn addition, we believe Aave v3 has big room for improvement in multiple directions that, to reduce the size of v3.4, have not been included, so we will propose those to the community in the shape of a v3.5 or more upgrades if fragmentation is required. It is important to highlight that these improvements don’t involve any full re-architecture of the system, as we agree with the upcoming v4 in the picture, that would not be too reasonable.\nSame time, considering the feedback on upgradeability procedures, we will lead an effort to make them stricter and formalised, procedures that the DAO can then potentially use for any of its production/upcoming infrastructure.\n- **Improvement of Umbrella post-activation**. The Umbrella system activation is imminent, and even though it is a very complete system, it will require improvements over time on the overall infrastructure: smart contracts, Aave DAO user interface, or better integration of it with other DAO infrastructure (e.g., compatibility with the future v4 if applicable).\nWe will work on all these aspects to maximise the value Umbrella brings to Aave.\n- **More Aave expansions to new networks**. Similar to the previous years, the demand to host Aave on different networks is constant. In the same line as on our previous scopes, we will participate in the technical and quality procedures for the Aave governance to activate v3 instances on those networks.\n    \n    This includes a process of continuous improvements on all layers: better/deeper network evaluations or better setup pre-activation.\n    \n- **Better off-boarding procedures for assets and networks**. Historically, the Aave DAO has been focused on establishing solid procedures for the onboarding direction of new assets to be listed and new networks to be present on.\nHowever, no matter if these procedures are exercised or not, currently there is an important lack of precise technical steps to off-board assets and networks whenever the expected KPIs by the DAO are not fulfilled.\nOur role will be to better define these steps and collaborate with other contributors to move them forward by any mechanism decided.\n- **Technical analysis of assets to be listed on Aave**. As we commented in our Phase 4 recap, one of the values we think the Aave DAO gives to the whole DeFi industry is helping to step up architectural and security standards on the assets (tokens) level, via the quality procedures they need to pass in order to get listed on Aave v3.\nAlso, this is a very important flow for the DAO in the future, as it is totally scalable/applicable for other upcoming systems like v4, still sharing similar principles asset-wise as v3.\n    Our role will remain the same as in the previous Phase 4.\n    \n- **Streamlining risk management flows on the technical side**. During the previous phase, the DAO has already been running in production more automated systems like the AGRS (Aave Generalised Risk Stewards), infrastructure to make the Aave on-chain ecosystem more efficient and less maintenance-heavy, which indirectly improves all other aspects of the DAO. \n    Our role in that has been developing the majority of that infrastructure, but also advising other contributors (e.g., treasury or risk itself) on how to better and safely expand in this direction.\n    We will keep doing the same, with the objective during these 6 months of having all possible systems following the constraint stewards-model, this way reducing governance proposals to only critical aspects.\n    \n- **Governance proposals reviews**. High-level, aside from decentralisation principles, we see governance proposals as a very strong mechanism of the DAO to achieve base security without requiring complex developments. This means that by having access control configured to the Aave Governance in new systems, that new system has very strong security by default, which later on can be made more granular, but without delaying go-to-market.\nThat base security is a consequence of multiple aspects, but the most important in what regards our past and proposed scope are:\n    - We review what, in practice, are all proposals by other contributors before they are created on-chain. This gives a very high assurance that everything being voted on is secure and of quality.\n    - Our pre-onchain role helps the on-chain proposal reviewers (Certora) to have a way simpler job, as there has already been very important groundwork prior.\n    - We have a very important presence also advising other contributors on how to better organise proposals, not only pure code review. For example, how to batch aspects to propose, or high-level advice on good practices.\n- **Support for the implementation steps of the [AAVEnomics](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aavenomics-implementation-part-one/21248)**. During the following months, other contributors (e.g. growth and treasury) will require technical support from our side to execute different steps on the implementation of the newly approved AAVE tokenomics.\nOur role here will be producing the required helper contracts and defining/reviewing procedures on each sub-step.\n- **Continuously improve DAO’s tooling**. Since the beginning of our Phase 1, we have been developing off-chain tooling for the DAO, benefiting integrators, service providers, or users themselves. For example, this is the case of the Aave Proposals repository, Aave Address Book, Aave Seatbelt, or even the DAO-owned [Governance v3 interface](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v3-interface).\nWe will continue to do the same, both improving the existing infrastructure and creating new ones when deemed appropriate.\nAdditionally, we will make an effort to move all the tooling to the Aave DAO organisation, always trying not to disturb the operations of the DAO in the process.\n- **Iterate on the SVR direction**. Aave <> Chainlink SVR has just been introduced, but we think it has a lot of potential for refinement from here, aside from expanding it to more assets on Ethereum or more networks.\n    \n    Until now, we have supported Chainlink as the Aave tech expert party, and we will continue in this role. Additionally, once SVR is in production with more assets, there could be different synergies with other systems of Aave, and we will contribute with any smart contract required.\n    \n- **Aave protocol security coordinator**. Same as in our previous engagements, this involves:\n    - Continuously evaluate technical risks for Aave.\n    - Address events involving any vulnerability affecting Aave. This also includes creating governance proposals if required.\n    - Act as technical support for the Aave Protocol and Governance Guardians: define and document plans of action, communicate with both of them whenever a reaction is needed, and also properly disclose to the community activity on the Guardian.\n    - Manage the bug bounty program (currently Aave <> Immunefi). Both operationally (as reviewers of submissions), but also structurally, if we consider, for example, a platform change could be worth it.\n- **Contribute to the final steps of v2 off-boarding**. Similar to what happened with v1, v2 has entered into its final deprecation stage, with its market size being approximately $300m.\nWe will participate in the final steps of its deprecation, which usually include changes on oracles, interest rate strategies, or even further measures like the ones applied on the v1 off-boarding Phases.\n- **Participate in the planning of any potential v3 off-boarding strategy**. It is not clear at the moment, and we think that definitely is not a good idea during the next 6 months, but if the DAO would approve any off-boarding plan of v3 in favour of v4 in the future, we can can support the party leading v4 advising on what in our opinion is a responsible way of doing it, without disturbing operations of the DAO.\n\n\n---\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phases II, III, and IV, 6 months: starting from the moment the previous engagement ended (1st April 2025) and lasting until 1st October 2025.\n\n**BUDGET**: **2’300’000 in stablecoins and 4’000 AAVE, 50% paid up-front and 50% streamed during the 6-month engagement**.\nThis is a slight reduction from our previous scope, as we think the community approving Aave v4 implies that changes on Aave v3 will be lighter than before, focusing on security and basic UX improvements, but without very deep re-architecturing. At the same time, Umbrella will enter into an improvement/maintenance phase, which adds to the scope.\n\n---\n\n\n## What is NOT part of the scope\n\nSimilar to Phases 3 and 4, we want to be explicit on what is not included in our line of contribution:\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development/or growth, which should be the responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do formal security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g., Aave v4), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora or other external third parties.\n- We will provide feedback on the design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor. Given our expertise, we have a pretty strong stand on architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\nMore explicitly, we are not the developers of Aave v4 and other ad-hoc initiatives like Aave v3 on Aptos, so aside from best-effort giving high-level advice (e.g., similar as we did with GHO or cross-chain GHO) to other contributors like Aave Labs, our scope doesn’t include any involvement/obligation on those.\n- We only work on projects with a TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g., reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not manageable for us to support any project in the pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identify a clear need from our side.\n- This scope includes EVM-only contributions. Any non-EVM ad-hoc requirement would need to be evaluated aside, as it is not our core expertise and would affect the delivery of all items in scope.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be run in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so. Any tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g., hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface or Umbrella’s) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n- We don’t produce centralised backend services for the DAO.\n- We prepare the existing technical infrastructure (e.g, Aave v3 instances) for a system fully controlled by the Aave DAO, or if following a friendly fork framework, whenever the configuration is not totally custom (e.g. main pool dynamics heavily changed, major custom code components and flows).\n    \n- We only build user interfaces for the DAO on those projects that we believe are simply not complete without that part of the infrastructure. For example, we think a project like Umbrella requires the DAO to own a UI, no matter who then runs it. Similar applies for the Aave Governance v3 UI.\nBut for any additional cases, we reserve the right to decide if any interface infrastructure is produced for the DAO or is exclusive property of BGD Labs, both those using Aave smart contracts or not.\n\n---\n\n# **Terms of Service**\n\nA formal Terms and Conditions document for the engagement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs can be found [**HERE**](https://bgdlabs.com/aave-dao-tos-phase5).\n\nHowever, we would like to highlight again the same high-level points as on Phases 3 and 4, which we think are very important for the ethos of the DAO:\n\n- **Major projects’ IP and licensing belong to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we should defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the core software (e.g. all on-chain smart contracts to be used by the DAO in production after governance proposals) we create during our engagement are licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts, both using the BUSL approach as on Aave v3 Origin, or more open source licenses if we think expanding the usage of Aave peripheral technology only helps the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication:\n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected in the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm commitment to always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n- **We compromise to not work with competitors of Aave on any core business that could hurt the DAO.** We are an independent company with potentially our own projects outside of this scope, but given our involvement on especially in the core Aave v3 protocol, we agree not to work with any direct competitor of Aave (other DeFi lending protocols) in core smart contracts development or security during these 6 months in scope.\n\n---\n\n# Disclosures\n\nBGD Labs has no meaningful commercial relation with entities that could create any type conflict of interest on the scopes of this proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Next steps\n\nIf/once this ARFC vote gets approved, we will proceed with an on-chain AIP, which will act as a binding formal agreement between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs.\n\nDuring this period (since 1st April) where we technically have no engagement, we will simply continue doing the same work as before, without stopping any of the on-going projects/developments.",

        "body": "# Summary\n\nAs continuation of the engagement finished 1st October, present to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development and security coordinator services.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nTime flies in DeFi, and it has already been two and a half years since BGD started working for the Aave DAO.\nDuring this time, the market has gone up and down, new protocols have appeared, and CEXes have fallen. But the Aave protocol remains, and, following almost any metric, it has grown.\n\nTogether with the work of other service providers, we want to believe our contribution has had an important role in both the stability of Aave (creating solid trust) and the growth itself, with tech enabling all new types of use cases while maintaining the highest standards of security.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nDuring the last 3 engagements between BGD Labs and the Aave DAO, all pieces of the Aave infrastructure have been worked on: the Aave protocol itself with new versions and maintaining the current ones, the Aave governance, bridging infrastructure, all rails for expansion to new networks and use cases, supporting non-technical contributors to maximise their value without being blocked by tech; basically everything.\n\nThe motivation/goal of this new engagement is:\n\n- Keep the stability and trust in the Aave technology.\n- Innovate responsibly on production systems.\n- Support all other non-tech contributors to the DAO, accelerating progress.\n\nIn summary, the same as before, but always striving for better.\n\n\n\n# Specification\n\n\n## Aave <> BGD Phase IV (continuous) scope\n\nThe scope of this Phase IV builds upon all previous phases, and as commented, is focused on continuous maintenance and development of the Aave ecosystem technical infrastructure, in combination with security coordination and support to other contributors.\n\nMore specifically, the services include the following:\n\n- **Propose improvements on top of the current Aave v3.2 production version**. This will include minimum a v3.3 and v3.4 versions, but with quite certainty, more.\n    \n    Additionally, we have several other ideas to improve the core protocol, which will be unveiled to the community as soon as the feasibility research is positive.\n    \n- **BGD will take back the scope of deploying to new networks and pool instances**. As commented on our Phase 3 final recap, we identified that having different entities on the deployment stage of Aave v3 creates more overhead than benefit. So we think for Phase IV it is more optimal to get the following entities involved in the activation procedures:\n    - BGD Labs will perform all the pre-governance proposal stages (deployment of required smart contracts, adaptation of all tooling, and development of the activation proposal itself).\n    - As it currently happens, Certora will review the on-chain governance proposal once submitted, in order to have redundancy.\n- **Maintain Aave Governance v3 and a.DI**. In this phase, the effort will be on improving the user interface owned by the Aave DAO, and on the a.DI side, increasing even more the visibility on the infrastructure (on https://adi.onaave.com/), streamlining upgrade procedures via governance proposals, and on-demand, enabling new paths and bridge providers.\n    \n    Additionally, with the rollups ecosystem evolving (e.g. ZK-based), we will once again evaluate the expansion of voting to other networks, an item we removed priority on the previous engagement as the return of resources investment was not there.\n    \n- **Aave bug bounty program**. After already close to 1 year of the Aave <> Immunefi bug bounty being active, we plan to make certain improvements to it. Same time, we will remain as reviewers, addressing all the submissions and the different stages until bounty payment.\n- **v2 further off-boarding**. At the beginning of the previous Phase 3, Aave v2 pools were still very meaningful instances of the protocol, both in size and usage. Currently, different off-boarding initiatives (both from us and other contributors) have reduced a lot the role of v2 in the ecosystem versus v3. During this engagement, we will proceed/support further proposals for off-boarding of v2, with the target being reaching a scenario where only very major assets stay (e.g. WETH, stETH, USDC, USDT), but everything else naturally gets finally migrated to v3.\n- **Focus on Aave Stewards and additional infrastructure delegation**. We believe the path of using what we name the Stewards pattern is most probably the future direction of Aave:\n    - The Aave Protocol (v3) is the base layer of smart contracts, enforcing the highest-order validations and general settlement logic. Decentralized, with only the Aave Governance having “super-admin” control.\n    - The protocol delegates operational/management functions to other smart contracts, the Stewards. These are highly constrained on-chain agents, that allow for faster and more optimal operations, but that can lose this power at any point if the Aave Governance decides so, and with low capacity to create any damage on the protocol.\n    - Currently, the Stewards are focused mainly on optimizing risk parameter updates, but we envision extending this pattern to multiple areas, for example, finance (a Finance Steward is in the advance stage by the treasury contributors).\n    \n    Our role in Stewards development will involve 1) defining an approach that is scalable enough for the current and future needs of the DAO 2) developing the core Steward contracts we believe require our involvement 3) if optimal, supporting other contributors to create their own Stewards, or modifying existing ones for the needs of the DAO.\n    \n- **Umbrella support post-release**. In Phase 3, we included a separate scope for the creation from scratch of Umbrella, a new version of the current Aave Safety Module. Scheduled to be released pretty soon, the project will require post-release support, mainly in the shape of:\n    - Supporting non-BGD contributors involved in all Umbrella operations, for example, regulation of incentives, and risk considerations like choosing correct targets.\n    - Improvements post-release.\n    - Iterating on tooling after the initial effort included with the previous Umbrella scope.\n- **Aave protocol security coordinator**. Same as in our previous engagement, this involves:\n    - Continuously evaluate technical risks for Aave.\n    - Address events involving any vulnerability affecting Aave. This includes also creating governance proposals if required.\n    - Act as technical support for the Aave Protocol and Governance Guardians: define and document plans of action, communicate with both of them whenever a reaction is needed, and also properly disclose to the community activity on Guardian.\n- **Aave proposals reviews**. We will review all governance proposals before they go on-chain, the same as we have been doing last year. This acts as the first layer of security and quality, minimizing any potential issue to be detected on the on-chain stage by Certora, on their line of contribution.\n- **Maintenance and improvement of all tooling of the Aave ecosystem**. During the previous phases, we created multiple tools and projects on the off-chain side of Aave, like Aave Address Book, the Aave Proposals repository, Aave Helpers, the Aave Config Engine and a myriad of others. During this new Phase, we will keep improving them and creating anything new needed.\n- **Analysis for candidate networks to activate Aave v3**. Even if the plan on the previous scope was to off-board network analysis, finally we decided to keep performing them ourselves, as the overhead of supporting another entity would not have been good resource allocation.\n    \n    In this new scope, we will continue performing this analysis.\n    \n\n\n---\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phases II & III, 6 months: starting from the moment the previous engagement ended (1st October 2024) and lasting until 1st April 2025.\n\n**BUDGET**: 2’300’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 50% paid up-front and 50% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n---\n\n\n## What is NOT part of both the scopes\n\nSimilar as on Phase 3, we want to be explicit on what is not included in our line of contribution:\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora. On our side, we only do a best-effort review if we deem it appropriate.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor. Given our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so. Any tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n- Very ad-hoc projects will depend on the pipeline of priority, and potentially will be budgeted/estimated independently, if we see they will have important implications on the scope that we need to fulfil and/or not fitting in this initial estimation. For example, any projects like Umbrella will be budgeted apart, and we don’t disclose them at the moment, due to being in feasibility research phase.\n\n\n# Terms of Service\n\nA formal Terms and Conditions document for the engagement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs can be found [HERE](https://bgdlabs.com/aave-dao-tos).\n\n\nWe would like however to highlight again the same high-level points as on Phase 3, which we thing are very important for the ethos of the DAO:\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the core software (e.g. all on-chain smart contracts to be used by the DAO in production) we create during our engagement are licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to new Aave v3 version, Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication:\n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if already doing it by commercialising all the different Aave products, we believe in the near future IP and licensing commercialisation is something the DAO should put focus on, at the same time common good infrastructure is released.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n- **We don’t work with competitors of the Aave DAO**. To do the type of work we do on Aave, the community should trust us as service provider. To avoid any type of conflict, we compromise to not work with any competitor of the Aave DAO for any type of financial gain.\n\n\n# Disclosures\n\nBGD Labs has no meaningful commercial relation with entities that could create any type conflict of interest on the scopes of this proposal.\nSimilar as during the previous years, the majority of our focus is on core development and security services on Aave (exclusive provider): we have absolutely no engagement with any entity that could be perceived as competitor of the Aave DAO and we will not during the duration of this Phase 4.\n\n\n# Next steps\n\nIf the outcome of this pre-approval Snapshot ARFC is positive, we will proceed with the final AIP on-chain proposal, which will act as binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs",

        "body": "# Summary\nPresent to the Aave DAO a proposal for BGD to continue as provider of development services, after Phase 1 and 2.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 1. Motivation. Aave and BGD 1, 2….3\n\nMay 9th 2022, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 1, a proposal for services to the DAO, covering a pretty extensive scope on the big majority of Aave sub-systems; development and security related.\n\nDuring the following 15 months, we [did or participated in dozens of projects](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-working-day-365/13033)  of technical nature for the Aave DAO, and more importantly, we set precedent that a model of a fully independent company providing services to a decentralised entity can work.\n\nSeptember 4th 2023, we presented Aave <> BGD Phase 2, with similar type of scope as Phase 1, but with slightly different objectives in mind: the technical foundation of the Aave DAO was pretty solid from Phase 1, and possible to iterate on top of it, with a more concrete scope.\nAdditionally, we set ourselves as a goal to study how to introduce extra technical parties to service specific needs of the DAO, helping more on the decentralisation of the organisation, but without disturbing operations and delivery.\n\nAlso, we proposed a way shorter engagement (6 months), which we thought was more optimal for the DAO to have capacity to manoeuvre. The outcome of this work can be found [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bored-ghosts-phase-2-recap/16791).\n\n\n\nWe think that our services to the DAO on both Phases had played a role on Aave staying in top of its category for years in so nascent field, and the Aave codebase being used in other products, accounting to close to 75% of total market share category.\n\nNow we present Phase 3, continuist, but with some important changes in terms of scope.\n\n---\n---\n\n# 2. Specification. Aave <> BGD Phase III. The scope\n\nThis time, we want to explicit divide our proposal in 2 different and explicit components, each one with its separate scope, budget and duration characteristics.\n\n## Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO\n\nThis scope is the continuist component historically performed by BGD for the DAO, and will be composed of the following items:\n\n- Maintain, improve and consolidate all the Aave tooling introduced in Phases I & II, including but not limited to Aave Address Book, Aave Helpers, Aave Proposals, Risk Stewards, Seatbelt and Killswitch.\n- Maintain and improve Aave Governance v3, a.DI and Aave Robot, together with the tooling surrounding them.\n    \n    The following new items will be delivered, consequence of the research done on Phase 2:\n    \n    - Extend coverage of voting networks to rollups, apart from the current Polygon PoS and Avalanche C-Chain.\n    - Allow voting with AAVE tokens held in non-Ethereum networks.\n    - Granular and generalised consensus rules for a.DI, together with different planned optimisations.\n- Propose further improvements on top of the upcoming Aave 3.1.\n- Different v3 maintenance tasks with important development requirements, including:\n    - Improve asset off-boarding procedures.\n    - Complete removal of stable debt logic.\n- Act as reviewers of Aave <> Immunefi for all current Aave ecosystem, not including GHO (Avara currently being the reviewer). Additionally, doing proper maintenance of the bug bounty program.\n- Act as security coordinator of the Aave ecosystem, including:\n    - Continuously evaluate potential technical risks for Aave.\n    - Design specific protection strategies in the event of any vulnerability affecting Aave.\n    - If arising, create governance proposals to mitigate any type of problem affecting Aave.\n    - Coordinate with the Aave Guardian for protective emergency actions.\n- Support with further technical off-boarding strategies for legacy versions of Aave (v1, v2) in a safe manner, both for the DAO and the users of the protocol.\n- Advise other contributors on which security procedures to apply for their developments, when required.\n- Evaluate new upcoming high-level technical implications/risks for the protocol, for example, new types of assets being listed.\n- Generally advise other contributors, whenever feedback from an entity expert on the Aave protocol is required. This includes but is not limited to contributors on the risk, treasury, security reviews and miscellaneous fields.\n- Review governance proposals on pre-onchain stage, not as a full security audit, but in order to verify that we don’t see any integration problem with Aave’s smart contracts and good practises.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 1. Aave technical maintenance, improvements, security coordination and tech advisory to the DAO*\n\n**DURATION**: same as with Phase 2, 6 months, starting from proposal execution.\n\n**BUDGET**: as some items are not included in the scope (more later), the budget has been reduced from Phase 2. 1’600’000 in stablecoins and 5’000 AAVE, 60% paid up-front and 40% streamed during the 6 months engagement.\n\n\n## What is NOT part of the scope\n\n- We are a technical provider of the community, we don’t do any type of business development and/or growth, that should be responsibility of other parties.\n- We don’t do security reviews on major developments of other contributors. We offer our security advisory for minor projects solely benefiting the Aave DAO, but on bigger scopes (e.g. something like GHO), that is up to parties engaged specifically on security, like Certora.\n- We will provide feedback on design of projects that we don’t lead only whenever the project is 1) of technical nature and 2) the final design is flagged as “ready” by the contributor.\nGiven our expertise, we have pretty strong stand in architecture and design decisions, which can create conflicts if no framework is defined.\n- We only work on projects with TEMP CHECK Snapshot passed (e.g. reviews). With the activity on the DAO increasing day by day, unless a filtering of projects is applied, it is not really manageable for us to support any project in pre-TEMP CHECK stage, unless we identified a clear need from our side.\n- We are not running services on behalf of the DAO, we design them to be ran in a decentralised manner, or by parties with the proper role to do so.\nAny tool we decide to run on our infrastructure (e.g. hosting of one instance of the Aave Governance v3 interface) is our own decision, outside of the scope of engagement.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Scope 2: Aave Safety Module - Code A\n\nAs commented before, we believe now the Aave DAO is in a really solid stage of their current systems, quite future-proof and ready to scale:\n\n- Aave v3 is a solid liquidity layer, on which is possible to iterate and improve.\n- Aave Governance v3 is probably the most advanced on-chain governance system in production.\n- a.DI is a totally generic bridging layer, that can be used for any cross-chain communication need on the Aave ecosystem, in a secure and scalable manner.\n- Aave Robot is a solid automation layer, integrated with Chainlink Automation, but flexible enough for any technology.\n\nMore in the line of innovative projects like Aave Governance v3, we propose to create a completely new system in an Aave component which requires improvement: the Aave Safety Module.\n\n\n### Aave Safety Module: Code A\n\nSafety Module Code A is the major project on the innovation side of this scope, but different to previous cases, our proposed approach is different: at the moment, we will not disclose a detailed description of it, as we think this is the right strategic approach for the DAO.\n\nHowever, we can say the following about Code A:\n\n- It will change completely the dynamics of the Safety Module and its components, including stkGHO, stkAAVE and stkABPT.\n- More efficient mechanism than the current.\n- Improved use experience.\n- Heavily improved dynamics for builders to build on top, but still batteries included.\n- Affecting importantly AAVE tokenomics.\n- Holistically designed, taking into account Aave v3 and GHO.\n- Directly/indirectly benefiting any future project of the DAO.\n\nWe are aware this requires some trust by the community on our research and execution capabilities (which is reflected on the payment schedule), but considering that the main beneficiary will be explicitly the DAO and our history of services, we think it is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n*Scope 2. Safety Module Code A*\n\n**DURATION**: this scope is not continuous like Scope 1, but our estimation is similar for full completion, approximately during the next 6 months to have everything fully ready and in production.\nHowever, delivery and communications will definitely be iterative, with extensive details of Project A to be disclosed in the first 2 months, and highly probably some of its components.\n\n**BUDGET**: 1’900’000 in stablecoins and 7’500 AAVE, with the following schedule:\n\n- 40% upfront.\n- 60% in a delayed payment in 4-months from now, when we estimate to be in good stage of completion.\n\n---\n---\n\n## Terms of Service\n\n- **Major projects IP and licensing belongs to the Aave DAO**. As a service provider to a DAO like Aave, we have an obligation to defend the interests of our customer. For that reason, the major software we have produced during our engagement have been licensed to the Aave DAO governance smart contracts. This applies but is not limited for example to Aave Governance v3, a.DI or others; systems that we consider highly innovative and not only improve the efficiency of Aave, but increase the overall value of the technology owned by the DAO.\n    \n    To insist on the previous fundamental implication: \n    \n    - The Aave DAO is the sole owner of the intellectual property and licensing of those projects.\n    - It is entirely up to the DAO to decide how to use and/or commercialise them, not to BGD Labs.\n    - Our benefit from those projects is the fee we receive from the DAO for developing the software.\n    \n    Even if other models can be explorer, from our point of view, this is a pretty solid contribution model for the innovation side of the DAO.\n    \n- **BGD doesn’t decide what gets activated/applied in Aave**. We create the software and the technical proposals to activate said software, but it is and will always be up to the DAO governance to decide if that software should be enabled in production.\n- **No software is flawless, but we pursue it**. Historically, no major problem has been detected on the developments we did for the DAO, but it is impossible to assure from our side that all software will be flawless. However, we have a firm compromise of always following solid security standards and procedures, to minimise any potential impact.\n\n---\n\n# 3. Next steps\n\nIf this ARFC Snapshot is positive, we will proceed with an on-chain governance proposal that will serve as formal and binding agreement for services between the Aave DAO and BGD Labs, on the terms defined.",

        "body": "# Title: [ARFC] Update the Asset Onboarding Framework\n\nAuthor: Marc Zeller - ACI ( Aave Chan Initiative)\n\nDate: 2023-11-21\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis ARFC proposes an updated process for new asset listings direct to establish a streamlined governance process for adding new markets and streamline the listing of assets with existing Aave markets on new chains. \n\n# **Motivation**\n\nNew asset listings are important to keep Aave v3 relevant but we have received feedback that the current process is unclear and subject to delays. In addition, there is no specific process for listing assets on new Aave deployments when the asset is already listed with existing Aave markets. These “new” asset onboarding could benefit from a more streamlined process. Delays in governance decisions could impede the platform’s ability to scale, while most of the new asset listing votes are pro-forma and pass without much discussion. This listing framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for asset onboarding. We have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal suggests a direct-to-AIP vote mechanism for listing assets that already have existing Aave markets on new chains. This expedited process ensures timely expansion of markets for new Aave deployments.\n\nTo summarize, here is an overview of the current standard proposal process:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k required)\n\nThis process takes around 23-25 days.\n\nThe current usage in the Aave DAO is to skip the TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshot stages for assets already onboarded on other Aave pools, but that’s not defined as a rule in a framework yet, this process still takes 13-14 days on average.\n\n**This ARFC suggests New asset listings should follow the template below so that governance and risk managers can make informed decisions and provide timely feedback.**\n\nWe propose that onboarding assets that already have existing Aave markets can be taken via a Direct-to-AIP process, similar to the existing [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937). This will allow quick listing of assets that have already been approved by governance for other chains, while managing risk considerations like chain-specific liquidity.\n\n**There will be 2 paths now for new asset onboarding**:\n\n1. **Net-new asset listings:** Net new asset listings that don’t have current Aave markets will continue in the current process stewarded by ACI Skyward. Skyward is now extended to support the process directly at the TEMP CHECK snapshot stage instead of the ARFC stage.\n2. **Direct-to-AIP Vote asset listings for assets that exist in Aave markets:** For assets that are eligible, an ARFC should be posted on the governance forum specifying the asset is a candidate for a direct-to-AIP framework process.\n\nDirect-to-AIP asset onboarding proposals must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n- Proposed asset must be an asset with at least one existing Aave market.\n- Proposals should be submitted by a risk service provider or have received feedback from at least one risk service provider team.\n- The proposed supply cap should not exceed 50% of supply on the respective chain.\n- The Asset has a Chainlink price feed that is **at least 90 days old**.\n1. **Normal Governance Process:**\n    - For situations not covered by the direct AIP vote conditions, the standard TEMP CHECK governance process will apply.\n2. **Applicability:**\n    - The framework is intended for all V3 liquidity pools.\n    - There will be a 24h minimum mandatory delay between the ARFC forum post and AIP publication.\n\n### FRAMEWORKS\n\n- [**TEMP CHECK] Format *(Net - New Asset Listing)***\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] onboard (asset) to Aave v3 on (chain) pool\n\nAuthor: \n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\n1. **Simple** **Summary:** A short description of the action desired\n2. **Motivation/Background:** \n\nExplain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Token and a background of that Token. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n*Asset Validation:* This is the first and most crucial step, which includes a detailed analysis of the asset. It should provide a comprehensive understanding of the token, its functionality, and the ecosystem it operates within. The asset’s utility, its role within its ecosystem, its backers, and its performance over time should be part of this validation. This data helps determine whether the asset aligns with Aave’s values and goals.\n\n1. **Benefits of listing that token:** Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue that new listing. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand, and also explain very well Market Impact. \n\n*Market Impact:* This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the asset’s inclusion on the Aave market. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new asset’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the platform’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n1. **Chain to be deployed/listed:** When explaining the intention of that asset to be in an specific chain and/or listing, justify as well the LTV, and basic information for the listing asset. Bear in mind that at [TEMP CHECK] stage, asset can be only in one chain, due to risk parameters recommendations.\n2. **Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \nThis information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize listings. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n    \n    a . If the chain’s treasury or foundation has commited to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n    \n    b. If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n    \n    c. If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailored made for Aave\n    \n    d. If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n    \n    e. If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n    \n3. **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance votes* about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n4. Disclaimer: \n    \n    Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n    \n5. Next Steps\n    \n    \n    1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n    2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\n    3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\n    4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\n6.

This information must be proposed by a risk manager or have input from at least one risk manager.\n4. (optional) **Audits / Security Reviews :** Aave DAO values security above all. Potential listing token and protocol need to assure that risk evaluation have been taken account:\n    \n    *Risk Assessment:* This involves a thorough analysis of the potential risks associated with the asset, conducted by a reliable risk provider. The assessment should consider various market risks including the volatility of the asset, its liquidity, and any other potential risks specific to the asset. The asset’s historical performance, its susceptibility to market fluctuations, and its liquidity in different market conditions should be part of this assessment.\n    \n    *Technical Considerations:* This involves the technical details of the asset. It should include the contract address of the asset, which is an essential detail required for listing. Additionally, the proposed Loan-to-Value (LTV), Liquidation Threshold, and Liquidation Bonus should be mentioned. These parameters are necessary to understand the lending and borrowing mechanics of the new asset within the Aave ecosystem.\n    \n5. (optional) **Useful Links:** Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please *include links to previous governance* *discussions* about the asset including both TEMP CHECK and TEMP CHECK snapshots.\n6.

The goal is to establish a transparent and community-driven approach for evaluating and deploying new Aave v3 instances.\n\n# Motivation\nNew chain deployments are a key part of the growth path for Aave v3, but the current end-to-end process is not always clear and subject to extended timelines. In addition, there is no specific process for prioritizing deployments on chains that will offer standing deposits like protocol-owned-liqudity, liquidity mining incentives, or other benefits for Aave protocol and our users. For example, Aave v3’s recent deployment on Gnosis Chain has benefited from deposits from Gnosis Chain’s DAO liquidity base.\n\nWe have established the precedent with past proposals that have improved timeliness and governance overhead, while allowing Aave to benefit from collaboration with partners from new blockchain development teams. The new deployment framework aims to balance security and speed by providing a more efficient governance process for moving forward with new instances of the Aave protocol. This ARFC is meant to define a clearer and accessible standard in the same spirit as the DAO’s historic process.\n\nBy establishing clear guidelines, the proposal aims to create an inclusive and efficient environment for new chain deployments, while maximizing the weight of Aave’s brand name and clear benefits from an Aave v3 deployment for new chain ecosystems.\n\n# Specification\nThe current governance process for new deployments is as follows:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nWe propose to keep the same steps, but introduce a more clear timeline and requirements for moving between proposal stages.\n\nUpdated timeline and requirements:\n\n- Post a TEMP CHECK governance thread for 5 days\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Documentation submission:\n- 7 days after the Snapshot vote\n     If deadline is not met, there will be a frozen period of 30 days. \n     After that period documentation could be analyzed again\n- Technical review duration\n     21 days since documentation submitted\n     If technical review fails due to security concerns, process will be frozen until \n     it’s been resolved.\n- Post an ARFC governance thread for 5 Days, after technical review has been successfully completed\n- Snapshot vote for 3 days (24 hours after gov thread)\n- Post an AIP vote for 5 days (Minimum 320k vote required)\n\nNew proposed deployment proposal workflow:\n \n![New Chain Deployment Framework.png](ipfs://bafkreiagvq52p4mwlokrswbbmyqegmjgiogp6bmxu7sz44ktiid45n5ln4)\n    \n\nFRAMEWORK FOR TEMP CHECK\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired (list & deploy a new Aave deployment on Aave). Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment], including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability.\n\n- Why it makes sense for all parties involved to pursue this new deployment. Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for TEMP CHECK phase to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments. To be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer: Statement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\nIf the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage\nPublication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ARFC\nTitle: [ARFC] Deploy Aave v3 on [XXX]\n\nAuthor:\n\nDate: in YYYY-MM-DD format\n\nSimple Summary: A short description of the action desired. Provide a comprehensive overview of the new deployment, including its technical features, security measures, and any unique benefits it brings to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nMotivation/Background: Explain the motivation behind the intention to list the new Aave deployment solution and a background. Please take into account that the proposal need to include:\n\n- Benefits of deploying in a new chain: Provide a brief overview of where the new Aave instance would be deployed and the significance of choosing this blockchain for its deployment, focusing on factors as scalability, security and interoperability. ****Bear in mind that it needs to be as much clear as possible for governance to understand the benefits and tradeoffs.\n\n- Market Impact: This includes an analysis of the potential impact of the deployment of an Aave market on the chain. This should take into consideration the effects on liquidity, user adoption, and overall market growth. The new chain’s potential to attract new users, its impact on the chain’s liquidity, and its contribution towards the growth of Aave should be analyzed.\n\n- Integration Review: Outline the technical details of the proposed integration. This includes specifics on how Aave’s lending and borrowing functionalities will interact with new Aave Deployment. For that, please share the result of both documentation submission and technical review, from TEMP CHECK, so community can understand the level of work, security and commitment. Avoid providing sensitive information.\n\n- Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments: This is a new requirement for ARFC phase, that has been as well implemented in TEMP CHECK stage, to identify if a particular new Aave deployment will be included in POL initiatives or has significant deposit commitments. This information will be considered in the decision-making process to prioritize deployments.\n\nTo be more specific, some criteria to be used in decision making will be:\n\n- If the chain’s treasury or foundation has committed to providing an initial liquidity pool for Aave or not, and details\n- If there are collaborations with external parties to bootstrap liquidity, to contribute to a more robust and diverse liquidity environment\n- If there has been established plans to implement liquidity mining programs tailor made for Aave\n- If the deployment supports staking and yield farming opportunities related to Aave\n- If it has been contemplated a Grant to Aave DAO to incentivize that deployment in comparison to other similar proposals\n\nSpecification: Include the initial assets that should be available as collateral and their risk parameters in a table. These should have received input from at least one risk manager service provider.\n\nDeployment Checklist: New deployments must have all of the following completed prior to posting an ARFC.\n\n- Risk service providers feedback\n- BGD Labs Infrastructure/technical evaluation\n- Oracle recommendation\n- The graph support\n- Cross-chain messaging infrastructure for governance\n- Useful Links: Any additional information that can help Aave DAO to decide. When sharing useful links please include links to previous governance votes about that asset and parameters, that will help reader/user understand the reasoning behind it and make a clear decision when voting.\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nStatement of Author potential conflict of interests and relationship with asset protocol and if they received compensation for publishing this proposal\n\nNext Steps\n\nRefine the ARFC based on community feedback and risk service provider recommendations.\nIf consensus is reached and the proposal is refined, submit the ARFC for a snapshot vote for final approval.\nIf consensus is reached, submit a deployment AIP to activate Aave V3 on the new chain.\nCopyright: Copyright and related rights waived under CC0.\n\n# Next Steps\n- Community Engagement: Engage with the Aave community to gather feedback on the proposed framework for new Aave v3 deployments.\n- ARFC Snapshot: If community sentiment is favorable, initiate an ARFC snapshot to gauge official support for the framework.\n- Implementation: Since this is a governance framework ARFC, if it passes snapshot, it will be implemented as the framework standard for new chain deployments going forward.\n# Disclaimer\nThe Aave-Chan Initiative (ACI) is not compensated in any form for creating this ARFC proposal.
