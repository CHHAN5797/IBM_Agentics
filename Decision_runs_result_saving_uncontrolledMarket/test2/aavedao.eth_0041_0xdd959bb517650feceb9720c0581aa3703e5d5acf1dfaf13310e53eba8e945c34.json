        "body": "---\n\ntitle: [ARFC] Aave Finance Steward\nauthor: @karpatkey_TokenLogic\ncreated: 2024-05-03\n\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nBuilding upon the success of the [Risk Stewards](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-risk-steward-phase-1-capsplusrisksteward/12602), this publication proposes creating a smart contract to enable \"Finance Stewards\" to execute on behalf of the DAO pre-approved and budgeted operations.\n\nThis proposal also marks a step forward in defining the asset management framework for Aave DAO, as introduced in the TokenLogic and karpatkey service provider [proposal](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633).\n\n# Motivation\n\nTo progressively streamline the management of the Aave DAO's funds by shifting approved ARFC proposals from on-chain vote to a trusted Finance Steward implementation.\n\nThe Finance Steward is a smart contract that will act as admin of the collector, it can do the exact same operations as the DAO Executor. The DAO has full ownership of the contract which grants it the ability to delegate permissions and budget specific actions to a Guardian, the Finance team. \n\nThe Finance Steward will enable the DAO to define a core set of financial capabilities to be carried out within strict role-based guardrails. As the role matures or new use cases arise, we plan to bring forward additional capabilities for the DAO to discuss.\n\nEfforts not included in the Finance Steward or being developed will still be covered through the normal governance process. This may include the recommendation to introduce purpose-specific safe multisigs with the intent to minimise governance burden (e.g. ALC, APE, etc…).  This design will map frequent key finance operations to a role-based governance-controlled solution, frequent but long-tail use cases to trust-minimised and efficient multisigs; and important, infrequent or strategic discussions to the full governance process.\n\n\nIt is relatively simple for the Aave DAO to grant granular control over the management of various parameters to Finance Stewards, but the complexity comes in term of decentralisation and self-protection of the protocol.\n\nThe initial introduction of the Finance Steward role will enable the tasks detailed in the Specifications to be performed. \n\n# Specification\n\n## Finance Steward v1.0 (Mainnet Only)\n\nThe initial Finance Steward implementation will work the following way:\n\n* A `FinanceSteward` smart contract will be created with an Owner and a Guardian. The Owner will be the DAO.\n* Guardian of the FinanceSteward contract will be a multisig with multiple signers, to be determined by the DAO.\n* The Collector Contract will be upgraded to have a system of roles whereby the same admin role can be held by multiple addresses, eg: FUNDS_ADMIN by the DAO's Executor and the FINANCE_STEWARD by the multisig proposed earlier.\n* Guardian can migrate assets from v2 and deposit into v3 to support seamless migration of the DAOs assets over time.\n* Guardian can be granted the ability to use the Aave Swapper to exchange assets held in the Treasury\n* Guardian can withdraw and deposit into V3.\n* Guardian can be granted the ability to transfer and stream tokens to pre-approved addresses within a budget, for example:\n    * ACI [Frontier](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-introducing-frontier-staking-as-a-service-for-the-aave-dao/16225) Program\n    * ACI [Merit](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-merit-a-new-aave-alignment-user-reward-system/16646) Program\n\nThe functionality will have the following limitations, enforced on-chain:\n\n* For each Aave market reserve, a [minimum balance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aaysvP2velw0hCBhH3huplumNwuN0FaA_bAZZTdjsmg/edit?usp=sharing) will remain in the collector\n* Tokens to swap to will be pre-approved by the DAO\n* Addresses to transfer to will be pre-approved\n* Tokens to transfer out of the Collector have a pre-defined budget set by the DAO\n\n## Future Phased Functionality Introduction\n\nThe following permissioned functionality is intended to be gradually introduced over time to further streamline the implementation of the DAO's financial transactions.\n\n* AAVE Protocol interactions in cross-chain deployments\n* Bridging from and to other chains\n\nSome of the above updates are pending other contracts to be delivered.\n\n# Disclosure\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no payment for this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave community.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1) Gather feedback from the community.\n2) If consensus is reached on this ARFC, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n3) If Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate this proposal to AIP stage\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "**Title:** [ARFC] karpatkey GHO Growth Service Provider\n\n**Author**: karpatkey\n\n**Date**: 2024-12-15\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicexfltthusqm4b5qldyfuuowezre3mgkvnipzgdlskwl432sgakm)\n    \n\n\n# Summary\n\nThe current ARFC proposes appointing karpatkey as a service provider dedicated to drive the growth of GHO for the following 6 months, with an initial focus on opportunities within the Gnosis Chain while also expanding efforts to other chains.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOver the past 12 months, karpatkey has been pleased to have supported the AaveDAO in improving treasury management practices and GHO adoption (see [Phase 1](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-financial-services-proposal-karpatkey-tokenlogic/15633) and [Phase 2](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-tokenlogic-karpatkey-financial-service-providers-phase-ii/18285) for more details). These efforts have been a significant success, and will continue, with the deployment of the [Finance Steward](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-finance-steward/17570)  upcoming features. That said, by focusing on increasing GHO’s adoption, we believe karpatkey can provide more value to the Aave ecosystem.\n\nThe stablecoin ecosystem is one of the most dynamic and competitive sectors in the DeFi landscape, and the accelerating adoption of GHO represents a unique opportunity for Aave DAO to solidify its position as a leader in this space. Since its deployment over a year ago, GHO achieved a notable milestone of a 180M supply across mainnet and Arbitrum, market depth in most reputable DEXes with total liquidity ranging between $30M and $50M. This success is a testament to the strength of Aave’s products, user base and brand.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigsbyl7vbhlbp4cwk7usqueivly4cdhtz7ibdvois3zerjx5t5xsm)\n    \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibrbisgdqx6tbdqbo5sxztbuakpbxe6rq5qd5v3irsufufwn57aju)\n    \n\nSource: [GHO Dashboard](https://dune.com/karpatkey/gho-weekly-digest-kpk)\n\nWhile GHO’s initial growth has been remarkable, the stablecoin market is evolving rapidly. The demand for reliable, decentralised stablecoins continues to grow, and GHO is well-positioned to capture this market—provided we continue to expand its utility, adoption, and ecosystem integrations proactively.\n\nkarpatkey has the [tools and resources](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/karpatkey-defi-treasury-network) to capitalise on the range of opportunities GHO presents. With a [proven track record in DeFi innovation](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure) and [strong partnerships with other DAOs](https://reports.karpatkey.com/), we are excited to present our new 6-month proposal to Aave DAO, focused on the areas where we can contribute most.\n\nTo drive proactive growth and expansion of GHO across multiple blockchains, we are proposing a phased mandate that includes tailored strategies for each ecosystem, with the initial phase prioritizing the deployment and adoption of GHO on the Gnosis Chain. With an Aave instance holding $100M, Gnosis Chain currently has a total value locked of $410M and a thriving environment of stablecoins, which includes Gnosis Pay, Monerium’s e-money EURe and other RWAs. We plan to focus primarily on opportunities where both AaveDAO and GnosisDAO can mutually benefit from a vibrant GHO ecosystem on Gnosis Chain, taking advantage of karpatkey’s unique position supporting both the DeFi ecosystems of both DAOs.\n\n# Specification\n\nDuring this first phase, our objectives will include:\n\n- Expanding GHO’s supply and utility through strategic integrations across the blockchains where GHO is deployed, and those where it will be deployed next, establishing GHO as a stablecoin of choice while maintaining its peg stability. karpatkey will continue to support the GHO stewards and the ALC to make this possible.\n- The deployment of GHO on Gnosis Chain,  in collaboration with other Aave Service Providers, to optimise the Gnosis Chain Aave instance for GHO’s adoption and success.\n- Introducing an sGHO vault on Gnosis Chain, building on the success of sDAI. This vault, to be developed in collaboration with @ACI, will provide a risk-minimized yield alternative that can be used as collateral for enhanced capital efficiency. The yield will be sourced through the successful Merit program, and will be amplified on Gnosis Chain by allocating incentives to staked liquidity only, further establishing GHO as a superior savings vehicle.\n- Drive a successful launch by establishing a 5M Aave treasury under non-custodial management infrastructure powered by Safe and [Zodiac Module](https://www.karpatkey.com/contents/on-chain-non-custodial-asset-management-infrastructure) technology. This infrastructure, developed by karpatkey and successfully utilized in our contributions to GnosisDAO, ENS, Balancer, and Nexus, will initially be funded with USDC. The treasury will support market-making activities for GHO on Gnosis Chain to seed market liquidity and integrations.\n- Manage the integrations of GHO in Gnosis Chain with key DeFi protocols. Particularly, we will explore optimal lending-market parameters and the value proposition of the EURe/GHO pair, maximizing the value of Gnosis Chain’s long-term foreign exchange use-cases.\n\n**Budget and duration**\n\nAfter a successful vote, this proposal will be funded with the following stream:\n\n- Budget 250K GHO over 180 days.\n- Address: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\nWe propose that the stream be funded with GHO from the Lido market to reduce Aave’s opportunity cost.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nkarpatkey is also a service provider for Gnosis DAO.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nAfter sufficient time for discussion and feedback on this proposal in the forum, we will escalate it to an ARFC Snapshot vote.\n\nIf the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, an AIP vote will be published for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Both parties will work in unison to ensure any future proposals within the agreed scope are jointly developed and endorsed.\n\n### Treasury Management\n\n#### Develop the Architecture for Managing Aave's Assets\n\nWe aim to define a robust architecture for asset management. This architecture will enable non-custodial asset management, incorporating role-based access controls preapproved by the community that will enable treasury diversification and yield optimization. This system will ensure the Aave DAO retains full control over fund retrieval and permission management, facilitated through Aave’s “shortExecutor”. Over time this will lead to fund management delegation and reduced governance overhead.\n\nAs the architecture for treasury management is being developed, the TokenLogic and karpatkey partnership will diligently progress with the necessary treasury operations, aligning them with the needs of the DAO and the stipulations of this proposal. All activities will be conducted in accordance with the established AIP model to avoid any disruptions.\n\n#### Financial Security\n\nA key objective is to secure sufficient funds to ensure a one-year runway, aligning with the DAO’s known budget and anticipated expenses. \n\nThis approach guarantees financial stability and operational continuity for Aave DAO. Key components of this objective will include:\n\n* Bridging Aave funds between networks;\n* Migrating funds from Aave v2 to Aave v3; and\n* Swap assets to align expenses and holdings.\n\nDo note, that financial statements have been omitted in order to present a cost-conscious, high-impact solution within the current budget. If the Aave DAO wishes to explore having financial statements as part of a broader proposal, we can later expand the funding to include the additional scope.\n\n### Strategic Assets' Liquidity\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey will lead the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) and oversee the management of liquidity incentives and Aave-owned liquidity in alignment with Aave’s strategic asset goals. One of the main focus areas will be supporting GHO’s token price recovery. Key initiatives include:\n\n* Foster concentrated liquidity profiles that support GHO’s price movement towards re-pegging while maintaining its utility across a full range of AMMs.\n    * Utilize Maverick’s design to automate liquidity concentration as prices evolve, while reducing the friction caused by liquidity fragmentation in concentrated boosted pools.\n    * Optimize incentives on Uniswap v3 for concentrated liquidity, tailored across three categories: fees, GHO, and other USD token liquidity. Prioritize USD liquidity, particularly when GHO is off-peg.\n    * Continuously review and adjust incentives on platforms that yield the best results.\n    * Initial focus is on skewed liquidity distribution to support regaining the peg. However, it is paramount to ensure existing liquidity providers find sufficient utility in their GHO funds (through sustainable strategies that make use of Aave’s AURA holding) to mitigate selling pressure.\n* Post-Repeg Strategy for GHO, explore sustainable approaches that preserve the token’s value and expand its functional role within the ecosystem:\n    * Implement optimized liquidity strategies through Maverick and Merkl to achieve balanced liquidity and deeper market depth.\n    * Enhance GHO’s extrinsic demand by incentivizing stable swap pools, such as Balancer’s GHO pools, leveraging Aave’s capacity for a significant TVL increase.\n     * Work with Gyroscope to deploy liquidity pools that align with Balancer’s architecture, using their advanced bonding curve model for concentrated liquidity AMMs. This strategic integration will use Aave-owned AURA to enhance GHO’s price stability.\n     * Deploy and incentivize markets beyond USD-pegged assets, including ETH, ETH LSTs, EUR, and Real World Assets (RWAs). This diversification will open up new investment avenues and attract liquidity providers with varying risk appetites.\n    * Collaborate closely with Aave and specialized risk service providers to support the deployment and configuration of the GHO Stability Module (GSM). This coordination will focus on fine-tuning critical parameters, taking into account prevailing market conditions. Our objective is to integrate the GSM with managed capacity, potentially even before GHO achieves full re-pegging, as a strategic mechanism to foster price stability.\n* To optimize the utilization of surplus votes resulting from incentivized liquidity, we propose to leverage excess voting power effectively, transforming it into tangible rewards through participation in voting markets such as Curve, Convex, Balancer, and Aura.\n\nFor operational simplicity and alignment with the DAO’s strategic objectives, evolving the GHO Liquidity Committee into the Aave Liquidity Committee is a logical step. \n\n### Safety Module\n\nAs part of the scope, karpatkey and TokenLogic will focus on modelling the SM performance during shortfall events and present proposals to diversify asset categories. This proposal will feature how the DAO can utilize the vlAURA position, realize synergies between GHO Liquidity and overall attempt to reduce the DAOs insurance fund spend.\n\nThe below outlines at a high level what we intend to deliver:\n\n* Introduce additional asset categories to promote diversification and reduce the dependence on AAVE as a backstop for the protocol. \n    * Initial parameter configuration will incorporate feedback from @ChaosLabs & @Gauntlet. \n    * We will explore the feasibility of including GHO LP assets and harness rewards from other protocols.\n    * Technical lift associated with creating new categories will be performed by @bgdlabs, with a security audit, if required.\n* A 90-day emission forecast will be provided ahead of each emission cycle for community feedback. TokenLogic and karpatkey will prepare the payload to extend the SM emissions for @bgdlabs for review. \n    * Iterative emission cycles enable the DAO to target specific asset categories and improve the correlations between bad debt potential whilst maintaining a base level of insurance. The proposal will feature the ability to reward some categories with non AAVE rewards, like GHO, to support adoption and velocity.\n* Capital efficiency, optimize emission schedules to balance attracting and retaining new deposits for each respective category. For example, the APR on stkAAVE is expected to continue being reduced given the recent GHO Mint Discount utility being added and the introduction of new categories.\n* Analytics, a dashboard will be created/maintained that tracks the effective coverage of the insurance fund under various market conditions. The deposit value, composition of assets, APR over time and impact on the DAOs runway will all be readily available for the community to view. This is expected to create transparency and provide insight into the performance of the SM as an effective insurance fund for the DAO.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe AIP will call the createStream() method of the IAaveEcosystemReserveController interface to create two 180-day streams for 220k and 180k of GHO.\n\nThe following address will be the recipient of the 220k GHO stream:\nAddress: `0x58e6c7ab55aa9012eacca16d1ed4c15795669e1c`\n\nThe following address will be the recipient of the 180k GHO stream:\nAddress: `0x3e4A9f478C0c13A15137Fc81e9d8269F127b4B40`\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey will periodically claim a fraction of the budget for the duration of the stream.\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey are to be included in the Gas Rebate program that reimburses on-chain voting, calling revenue contracts, deployment and testing costs.\n\nUpon the ARFC Snapshot passing, the GLC SAFE Signers will be updated. The following signer `0xAFe4043c9FFd31753c5bE2B76dfc45AaA70ebD6f` is to be replaced with `0x818c277dbe886b934e60aa047250a73529e26a99`.\n\nWhen the AIP onboarding TokenLogic and karpatkey as service providers pass, TokenLogic and karpatkey will jointly lead the GLC for the duration of the service provider contract with the Aave DAO.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal. TokenLogic and karpatkey are both delegates within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy a Gnosis DAO Credit Line Aave v3 Instance\n\n**Author:** @ACI and Karpatkey\n\n**Date:** 2024-09-20\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a specific Aave v3 instance to extend a GHO credit line to Gnosis DAO using GNO and wstETH collateral.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGnosis DAO, a long term partner of Aave DAO, has expressed a need for flexible access to stablecoins. This proposal aims to address this need by leveraging Gnosis DAO's treasury holdings as collateral for a GHO credit line funded by Aave DAO. By establishing this credit facility, we can enhance Gnosis DAO's liquidity management capabilities while fostering closer collaboration between Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO.\n\nThe proposed credit line will provide Gnosis DAO with a reliable source of stablecoin liquidity, enabling them to manage their treasury more efficiently and respond quickly to market opportunities or operational needs. This arrangement also presents an opportunity for Aave to expand its services to other DAOs, potentially opening up a new market segment. The credit line will also serve as a proof-of-concept for further customized extension of credit to reputable DAOs and organizations in the industry.\n\nThe GnosisDAO GHO credit line is described by the following conditions:\n\n- **Exclusive Borrower:** Gnosis DAO will be the only borrower in this specialised GHO market.\n- **Collateral Requirements:** GNO and wstETH tokens will be the primary collateral. Other potential collaterals can be considered but must be approved at a later stage.\n- **Risk Parameters:**\n  - Borrowing Rate (BR): DSR rate\n  - Other risk parameters will be discussed and decided upon by relevant service providers in collaboration with GnosisDAO during the ARFC phase of this proposal.\n- **Liquidation Process:** Managed by a designated Aave entity to ensure controlled handling of collateral.\n- **Progressive Cap Increase:** An initial Cap of 5M GHO will be configured\n  - Once the initial cap is utilized and the system operates smoothly for a predefined period (e.g., 1 month), the cap will increase progressively.\n  - The increase will be contingent upon maintaining a healthy average Health Factor (e.g., above 1.5).\n  - Further increases will be evaluated based on ongoing performance metrics and governance approvals.\n\n### Benefits for Aave\n\n- A dedicated GHO borrowing market will increase the demand for GHO and its supply.\n- Generates consistent income from the interest paid on GHO borrowing by Gnosis DAO.\n- GNO is first-class crypto asset that is currently securing the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n- Gnosis DAO will be able to further provide liquidity enhancing GHO's value proposition as DeFi stablecoin in mainnet, and specially once GHO is deployed in GC.\n- GnosisDAO is a reputable DAO with one of the largest treasuries and footprint in DeFi.\n\n### Benefits for Gnosis DAO\n\n- Provides Gnosis DAO with a reliable and sustainable credit line to support its operations and growth.\n- GNO as collateral will increase the treasury's capital efficiency and help in yield generation by borrowing GHO and putting it to use.\n- Tailored risk parameters offer better borrowing conditions compared to other lending markets.\n- Permissioned liquidation within Aave representatives will ensure proper collateral management, minimizing the risk of market manipulation, price volatility and sudden large sell-offs, also protecting Aave from excessive losses.\n- With the implementation of karpatkey's infrastructure and risk management best practices, tooling and monitoring will be put in place to ensure the debt position is properly managed at all times.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Gnosis DAO credit line will implement the following:\n\n- Credit Line Amount: 5 million GHO tokens to start, with the option to size up based on risk service provider feedback and DAO governance process.\n- Collateral Assets: GNO and wstETH\n- Authorized Users: Limited to Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO\n- GHO Borrow Rate: Set to match the current sUSDS rate of 6%\n\nThis credit line will be implemented as a specialized Aave v3 instance with the following key features:\n\n- Customized access controls to ensure only Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO can interact with the instance\n- Tailored risk parameters for GNO and wstETH as collateral assets\n- Regular reporting and monitoring mechanisms to track the usage and health of the credit line. ACI will propose further methods for safe management of this credit line pending further discussions with Gnosis DAO and risk service providers.\n\nBy implementing this credit line, we aim to provide Gnosis DAO with a flexible financial tool that leverages their existing treasury assets while maintaining the security and transparency inherent in Aave.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI did not receive compensation for creating this proposal. ACI and employees are holders and stakers of GNO as well as delegates within the Gnosis ecosystem. Gnosis DAO and Aave also share some service providers including finance service provider Karpatkey.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

        "body": "## [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave on Rootstock Network\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2025-01-07\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check advocates the deployment of Aave on the Rootstock network, the longest-standing and battle-tested EVM-compatible Bitcoin L2, by providing general background information to gauge the community's interest in the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Rootstock.\n\nThis deployment proposal is an opportunity to tap into the growing interest in Bitcoin-based DeFi and unlock the vast potential of the Bitcoin market cap by expanding BTC utility via Aave's protocol. This would be possible through Rootstock's native token, RBTC, which is a 1:1 BTC-pegged asset redeemable for BTC via a secure and trust-minimized two-way-peg. As a Proof-of-Work chain [secured by more than 60% of Bitcoin's hash power](https://stats.rootstock.io/) through a merged-mining mechanism, Rootstock ensures a safe network for those users who aim to leverage their BTC but do not want to lack Bitcoin security.\n\nThe proposal outlines a comprehensive liquidity bootstrapping and incentives distribution strategy to ensure the success of deploying Aave on Rootstock. This includes an initial liquidity injection commitment of 500 RBTC in collaboration with RootstockLabs and ecosystem partners and a $750,000 incentives program. Rootstrock is also willing to integrate the GHO stablecoin in its ecosystem providing rate predictability for users.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRootstock, the first and most secured Bitcoin Layer, aims to enhance Bitcoin's functionality by allowing smart contracts on top of Bitcoin. It is the first EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain and uses merged mining consensus for enhanced security and scalability. Rootstock has secured over 60% of the total Bitcoin hashrate, meaning that more than 60% of Bitcoin miners are securing the Rootstock network using the same hardware and energy input.\n\nThe permissionless network has experienced significant growth in 2024 in all major metrics. This can be attributed partially to Rootstock's onboarding and partnership with major protocols such as Sushi and Uniswap. Liquidity's strong proliferation demonstrates the growing demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi applications.\n\nRootstock employs a unique bridging system called Powpeg to enable the secure transfer of BTC into the Rootstock network as RBTC, and vice versa. This system is managed by specialized nodes known as Powpeg functionaries, which include entities like BlockVenture, Luxor, pNetwork, Collider, RootstockLabs, and Xapo.  Rootstock's [public roadmap](https://rootstock.io/roadmap/) includes several technical upgrades to improve speed, security, and functionality. This innovative roadmap led by Sergio Lerner, RootstockLabs’ Chief Scientist and Co-Founder, also selected as one of 50 people influential in Crypto in 2024 by [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2024/12/05/most-influential-2024), has been implementing several upgrades such as the development of [BitVMX](https://bitvmx.org/), a trust-minimized bridge between the Bitcoin mainchain and Rootstock sidechain.\n\nDeploying Aave V3 on Rootstock offers a strategic advantage by capitalizing on the growing demand for DeFi applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The increasing usage of wrapped Bitcoin on EVM chains serves as a proxy for this latent demand, indicating a desire to utilize Bitcoin-based collateral in DeFi protocols. Rootstock addresses this demand by providing a more decentralized and self-custodial alternative through its native token RBTC, and its underlying infrastructure.\n\n### **Reasons for Integration:**\n\n- **Access the Bitcoin-based DeFi through a battle-tested Bitcoin L2:** It has a large ecosystem with 170+ dApps and protocols deployed and a growing TVL. With the growing demand for Bitcoin-based DeFi, Rootstock is well-positioned to capitalize on this market as it is the network with real utility and use cases. Its canonical deployment on Uniswap V3, which got over 40 million votes, demonstrated the rising demand and interest in Rootstock. The combination of Rootstock’s features with a widely used protocol is the key to a win-win integration. Strategic integrations with Top tier dApps like Uniswap v3 on Oku, Sushi, Algebra DEXs, Solv Finance, Money on Chain, Symbiosis, Pell Network make Rootstock leading the DeFi ecosystem in the Bitcoin L2 space.\n- **Advanced Infrastructure :** Rootstock is the most advanced and complete infrastructure ecosystem in the Bitcoin Layer 2 space with Oracles, Indexers, and Developers tools, including Chainlink (Price feeds and CCIP integration by January/February), Redstone Finance, Alchemy, Gelato, The Graph, Goldsky, Bware Labs.\n- **RBTC, as a Bitcoin-asset collateral:** Rootstock uses RBTC (bridged version of Bitcoin) for transaction fees, avoiding the need for a separate native token. The Powpeg system handles the transfer of value between Bitcoin and Rootstock, minting and burning RBTC as required. This makes it an ideal collateral for DeFi lending and borrowing. By deploying Aave on Rootstock, Aave can enable users to use RBTC as collateral for loans, which will address demand and diversify options for Bitcoin-backed assets. Rootstock has this ambitious plan to expand RBTC to other chains. RBTC enables the most decentralized, secure, seamless, omnichain access to Bitcoin for DeFi use cases, allowing users to retain Bitcoin's core properties.\n- **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Rootstock has been investing in core-infrastructure partnerships, which facilitate the flow of assets between several networks. In the past months, it has announced several Top-tier partnerships like LayerZero, Stargate, LiFi, Jumper Exchange, Symbiosis, ChainPort, Rubic. No other BTC L2 can offer Rootstock trajectory and assets deployed by Stargate.\n- **GHO Integrated with the Ecosystem:** Rootstock will integrate and support the GHO stablecoin as a key USD stablecoin. By integrating GHO, Rootstock will unlock new opportunities for users to leverage the value of their Bitcoin holdings with rate predictability for users. RootstockLabs plans to bootstrap GHO liquidity in Rootstock's DEXs like Uniswap and Sushi, and also foster users' adoption by distributing incentives in GHO pools.\n- **Access to Institutions liquidity: RootstockLabs is already actively collaborating with institutional partners to attract and secure institutional capital across the network. Those institutions already showed their interest to use Aave for lending against Bitcoin and this deployment will be strategic to address capital allocation from institutional partners like Crypto banks, Hedge Funds, Liquid Funds and miners.**\n\nThis active collaboration with institutional investors aims to attract extra deposit commitments to ensure liquidity diversification and high adoption of Aave in Rootstock. Rootstock is able to address institutional demand in the Bitcoin Layer space because it is integrated with Fireblocks and Utila, which ensures access to Rootstock and its ecosystem. In 2025, RootstockLabs team is working to expand institutional-grade partnerships to be consolidated also as the most advanced infrastructure for institutional investors.\n\n## **Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments**\n\nRecognizing the monumental opportunity to unlock and capture an emerging market in the Bitcoin-based DeFi ecosystem, this proposal outlines a robust liquidity and incentive strategy designed to attract and retain users on Rootstock.\n\n- **Proof of Liquidity: To ensure a strong start for Aave on Rootstock, RootstockLabs, the core contributor to Rootstock, along with ecosystem and institutional partners, will commit a substantial amount of liquidity to Aave's pools.**\n    - **Liquidity Bootstrapping of 500 BTC (approximately $50 million USD).**\n- **Incentives Distribution: RootstockLabs has partnered with IntoTheBlock to design and develop a liquidity bootstrap plan across the network through incentives distribution, this plan includes Aave. By deploying on Rootstock, we will distribute $750,000.00 in incentives for fostering Aave's adoption across Rootstock network.**\n    - **LM Goal:** this program will incentivize liquidity providers in the Bitcoin landscape to actively participate in the Aave's markets on Rootstock, ensuring diversified liquidity in the ecosystem.\n\n## **Technical Feasibility**\n\n1. **Seamless Integration and Compatibility with v3:**\n    - Rootstock is an [EVM-compatible chain](https://dev.rootstock.io/concepts/fundamentals/stack/), which means Ethereum smart contracts are fully compatible.\n2. **Chainlink Integration:**\n    - RootstockLabs team has received a commitment from Chainlink to get its deployment live by January/February.\n3. **The Graph Integration:**\n    - Rootstock has deployed The Graph functionality on Mainnet, which will be available for Aave's integration.\n4. **Development and Testing**\n    - RootstockLabs will assist Aave's technical team and BDG Labs through its Integration and Support team to ensure a smooth integration.\n5. **Security Audits:**\n    - The RootstockLabs team, in collaboration with Aave's security team, will run audits to ensure that the deployment meets all security requirements.\n\n## **Deployment Plan**\n\n1. **Phase 1: Initial Discussion**\n    - Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n2. **Phase 2: Detailed Proposal**\n    - If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n3. **Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring**\n    - Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on Rootstock and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n## **Risks and Mitigations:**\n\n1. **Technical Challenges:**\n    - RootstockLabs will work closely with Aave's developers and service providers to address any technical challenges during integration.\n2. **Security Risks:**\n    - A robust security audit will be conducted by Chaos Labs and LlamaRisk in order to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with this proposal and deployment. RootstockLabs will be available to address raised concerns, and support this audit.\n3. **Community Adoption:**\n    - RootstockLabs will activate its community to engage with the Aave community ensuring support and adoption. Also it will work aligned with the Aave community to engage and attract users to Rootstock.\n\n## **Call to Action:**\n\nWe invite the Aave community to express their support or concerns regarding this TEMP CHECK. Your feedback is crucial in determining whether to proceed with a detailed ARFC for the Aave V3 deployment on Rootstock, and will help us ensure that the integration aligns with Aave’s goals and community interests.\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nRootstock Concepts: https://dev.rootstock.io/concepts/\n\nUnderstanding Rootstock by Messari: https://messari.io/report/understanding-rootstock\n\nState of Rootstock Q3 2024: https://messari.io/report/state-of-rootstock-q3-2024\n\nRootstockLabs: https://www.rootstocklabs.com/\n\nAave Documentation: https://aave.com/docs\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Publication of TEMP CHECK, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to TEMP CHECK snapshot stage.\n2. If the TEMP CHECK snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an ARFC to continue gathering community and Service Providers feedback.\n3. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## **Disclaimer**\n\nThe current proposal is powered by Skywards.\n\nACI (Aave Chan Initiative) is not directly affiliated with Rootstock Network and did not receive compensation related to this proposal.\n\n## **Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",
