        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy a Gnosis DAO Credit Line Aave v3 Instance\n\n**Author:** @ACI and Karpatkey\n\n**Date:** 2024-09-20\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a specific Aave v3 instance to extend a GHO credit line to Gnosis DAO using GNO and wstETH collateral.\n\n## Motivation\n\nGnosis DAO, a long term partner of Aave DAO, has expressed a need for flexible access to stablecoins. This proposal aims to address this need by leveraging Gnosis DAO's treasury holdings as collateral for a GHO credit line funded by Aave DAO. By establishing this credit facility, we can enhance Gnosis DAO's liquidity management capabilities while fostering closer collaboration between Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO.\n\nThe proposed credit line will provide Gnosis DAO with a reliable source of stablecoin liquidity, enabling them to manage their treasury more efficiently and respond quickly to market opportunities or operational needs. This arrangement also presents an opportunity for Aave to expand its services to other DAOs, potentially opening up a new market segment. The credit line will also serve as a proof-of-concept for further customized extension of credit to reputable DAOs and organizations in the industry.\n\nThe GnosisDAO GHO credit line is described by the following conditions:\n\n- **Exclusive Borrower:** Gnosis DAO will be the only borrower in this specialised GHO market.\n- **Collateral Requirements:** GNO and wstETH tokens will be the primary collateral. Other potential collaterals can be considered but must be approved at a later stage.\n- **Risk Parameters:**\n  - Borrowing Rate (BR): DSR rate\n  - Other risk parameters will be discussed and decided upon by relevant service providers in collaboration with GnosisDAO during the ARFC phase of this proposal.\n- **Liquidation Process:** Managed by a designated Aave entity to ensure controlled handling of collateral.\n- **Progressive Cap Increase:** An initial Cap of 5M GHO will be configured\n  - Once the initial cap is utilized and the system operates smoothly for a predefined period (e.g., 1 month), the cap will increase progressively.\n  - The increase will be contingent upon maintaining a healthy average Health Factor (e.g., above 1.5).\n  - Further increases will be evaluated based on ongoing performance metrics and governance approvals.\n\n### Benefits for Aave\n\n- A dedicated GHO borrowing market will increase the demand for GHO and its supply.\n- Generates consistent income from the interest paid on GHO borrowing by Gnosis DAO.\n- GNO is first-class crypto asset that is currently securing the Gnosis Chain ecosystem.\n- Gnosis DAO will be able to further provide liquidity enhancing GHO's value proposition as DeFi stablecoin in mainnet, and specially once GHO is deployed in GC.\n- GnosisDAO is a reputable DAO with one of the largest treasuries and footprint in DeFi.\n\n### Benefits for Gnosis DAO\n\n- Provides Gnosis DAO with a reliable and sustainable credit line to support its operations and growth.\n- GNO as collateral will increase the treasury's capital efficiency and help in yield generation by borrowing GHO and putting it to use.\n- Tailored risk parameters offer better borrowing conditions compared to other lending markets.\n- Permissioned liquidation within Aave representatives will ensure proper collateral management, minimizing the risk of market manipulation, price volatility and sudden large sell-offs, also protecting Aave from excessive losses.\n- With the implementation of karpatkey's infrastructure and risk management best practices, tooling and monitoring will be put in place to ensure the debt position is properly managed at all times.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposed Gnosis DAO credit line will implement the following:\n\n- Credit Line Amount: 5 million GHO tokens to start, with the option to size up based on risk service provider feedback and DAO governance process.\n- Collateral Assets: GNO and wstETH\n- Authorized Users: Limited to Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO\n- GHO Borrow Rate: Set to match the current sUSDS rate of 6%\n\nThis credit line will be implemented as a specialized Aave v3 instance with the following key features:\n\n- Customized access controls to ensure only Gnosis DAO and Aave DAO can interact with the instance\n- Tailored risk parameters for GNO and wstETH as collateral assets\n- Regular reporting and monitoring mechanisms to track the usage and health of the credit line. ACI will propose further methods for safe management of this credit line pending further discussions with Gnosis DAO and risk service providers.\n\nBy implementing this credit line, we aim to provide Gnosis DAO with a flexible financial tool that leverages their existing treasury assets while maintaining the security and transparency inherent in Aave.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe ACI did not receive compensation for creating this proposal. ACI and employees are holders and stakers of GNO as well as delegates within the Gnosis ecosystem. Gnosis DAO and Aave also share some service providers including finance service provider Karpatkey.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to the ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating the proposal to the ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under CC0",

        "body": "# [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave v3 on Mantle\n\n## Author: ACI\n\n## Date: 2024-12-20\n---------\n## Simple summary\n\nThe current [TEMP CHECK] proposes deploying Aave V3 on Mantle Network.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMantle Network is an EVM-compatible Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum (rollup), enabling existing Ethereum contracts and tools to operate with minimal modifications. By leveraging a modular architecture, Mantle combines an optimistic rollup design with innovative data availability solutions to reduce costs while maintaining Ethereum’s security. Data availability is managed by an external DA layer, currently powered by EigenDA technology through Mantle DA, with plans to fully adopt EigenDA upon its mainnet stable launch.\n\nBy deploying on Mantle, Aave can take advantage of Mantle’s integration with Bybit products, enabling seamless access to Bybit’s 30 million active users. This creates a significant opportunity to broaden Aave’s user base and make DeFi more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nMantle currently boasts a TVL of approximately $570 million, while its flagship LST (mETH) holds a TVL of $1.85 billion. More details [here](https://defillama.com/chain/Mantle).\n\n## Benefits of deploying on Mantle\n\n- **Accessibility and Distribution**\n    \n    As Mantle is closely integrated with Bybit, Aave’s deployment on Mantle positions the protocol in front of an expanding audience.\n    \n    - This integration creates a gateway for tens of millions of potential new users to access Aave’s lending and borrowing products, making DeFi simpler and more accessible than ever before.\n- **Incentive campaigns**\n    \n    Mantle’s ongoing incentive program, Metamorphosis Season 2 offers a powerful catalyst for user engagement and liquidity growth within the ecosystem.\n    \n    - Restaking mETH into cmETH, participants earn Powder—soon to be convertible into COOK, the governance token of the mETH Protocol—and gain exposure to multiple streams of yield from staking, restaking, and additional protocol rewards. cmETH also accruing value through EigenLayer, Karak, Symbiotic and Veda points.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments\n\nThe Mantle team will provide the following, upon its deployment is confirmed:\n\n- 16M units of MNT value at around 19.2M USD valuing MNT at $1.20 ea\n- COOK points and Ethena Sats\n- $20M in USDC/USDT Supply\n- $20M in ETH Supply\n- $50M in other asset supply\n\nMore details will be shared on ARFC stage.\n\n# Specification\n\nRisk Parameters will be provided by Service Providers and this section will be updated at ARFC stage if proposal moves forward, after successful TEMP CHECK Snapshot.\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The ACI is not directly affiliated with Mantle and did not receive any compensation for creating this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "## [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave on Soneium\n\n## Author: Mingshi S.\n\n## Date: 2025-02-10\n\n## Summary\n\nThis Temperature Check advocates for the deployment of Aave on [Soneium](https://soneium.org/), an Ethereum L2 developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs (a joint venture between [Sony Group Corporation](https://www.sony.com/en/) and [Startale Group](https://startale.com/en)). The proposal aims to provide general background information to gauge the community’s interest in the opportunity to deploy Aave V3 on Soneium.\n\n**This deployment proposal is an opportunity to tap into a consumer-focused Ethereum L2 and utilize Sony’s distribution channels and access to real-world consumers.** Built with OP Stack, Soneium offers a scalable, low-cost, and highly interoperable infrastructure for DeFi protocols. The deployment would integrate Aave into an Ethereum L2 designed for mainstream adoption, potentially tapping into Sony’s user base and an upcoming dynamic ecosystem of DeFi, gaming, NFTs, RWAs, and entertainment applications.\n\nThe proposal includes an ecosystem-wide liquidity incentive campaign, targeting a 7-figure USD commitment (100,000,000 [ASTR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astar/)) to support DeFi protocols, including Aave, to bootstrap liquidity on Soneium. Soneium is also willing to integrate and increase the adoption of GHO stablecoin in its ecosystem, especially for future real-world-focused use cases.\n\n## Motivation\n\n\"Empowering individuals and communities to collaborate, create, and fill the world with emotion together.\"\n\nSony Block Solution Labs believes that the development of [a comprehensive Web3 solution](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202501/25-002E/) based on blockchain technology has big potential for the company, which has developed a wide variety of businesses as part of its purpose to \"fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology\".\n\nSoneium launched its mainnet on January 14, 2025, settled 10M+ on-chain transactions with 2M+ unique wallet addresses as shown on [Blockscout](https://soneium.blockscout.com/), and achieved $45M+ total value secured according to [L2Beat](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/soneium), within 3 weeks. Soneium has also launched the Soneium Spark Incubation Program, attracting over 1,700 builders and projects. The participating Sony Group Companies include Sony Group, Sony Music, Sony Pictures, Sony Innovation Fund, Inzone, and Sony Global Education. Please refer to [here](https://x.com/soneium/status/1845766611677900923) for the list of winners of the first Soneium Spark.\n\nWe see DeFi as the backbone of blockchain adoption and is built with a vibrant DeFi ecosystem that promises to be both innovative and robust, featuring a well-rounded mix of multichain and native protocols. Notable names including Uniswap v4, Velodrome, QuickSwap, Stargate, Squid, Lido, Mellow, StakeStone, KelpDAO, Solv, OpenEden, etc. Our Soneium Spark program also incubated several standout projects that will be launching as native DeFi protocols on Soenium, bringing unique features and services to our users, including Kyo Finance (AMM), SoneX (AMM), SuperVol (On-chain Options), WaveX (Perpetuals), Macaron Finance (Leveraged Farming), etc.\n\nIn addition to the existing Web3 services, the Soneium team has been investigating how new services that collaborate with businesses within the Sony Group can be developed as Soneium-compatible apps. Specifically, we will explore protecting the rights of content created by creators, new mechanisms for distributing profits to support creators and fans, and opportunities for creators to be active across the digital and real worlds.\n\nFurthermore, by utilizing Web3 services, such as the Japan-regulated crypto exchange operated by Sony Group's S.BLOX Inc., and adding new value to the various businesses and utilizing IPs,, we aim to create apps that can be used daily by people who have never had the opportunity to experience Web3, and to build a world where Web3 services permeate people's daily lives.\n\n### Reasons for Integration:\n\n* **Potential to tap into the existing users from the [Sony ecosystem](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/products/) and further expand Aave user base with Soneium’s distribution networks and go mainstream together.** Soneium settled 10M+ on-chain transactions with 2M+ unique wallet addresses and achieved $45M+ total value secured within 3 weeks after launch.\n* **Establish Aave’s position as the major liquidity market and early mover on Soneium** and capture a rapidly growing market in the ecosystem with a focus on real-world adoption (e.g. JPY-USD carry trade on-chain to explore, etc.)\n  * We envision Soneium to be one of the most unique ecosystems in the crypto world that truly foster Web3 mainstream adoption utilising Sony’s distribution channels and business opportunities. We see Aave as an important and reliable partner to facilitate users’ demand in lending, borrowing, leveraging, and earning passive income.\n * Integrate closely with Soneium’s rapidly growing DeFi ecosystem, including strategic integrations with top-tier dApps like Uniswap, Velodrome, QuickSwap, Stargate, Squid, Lido, StakeStone, Mellow, Solv, OpenEden, etc. **Soneium has been in the first batch of blockchains for Uniswap v4 deployment with Uniswap frontend supported by Uniswap Labs.**\n* Operates in a high throughput, tps, and low gas fees environment based on OP Stack to provide a smooth UX and efficient lending experience. **Soneium is also equipped with top-tier infrastructures including Chainlink, Pyth, RedStone, LayerZero, Axelar, Superbridge, Across, Hyperlane, Li.Fi, Jumper Exchange, The Graph, etc.**\n* **Receive liquidity incentives for Aave depositors in any upcoming ecosystem-wide liquidity incentive campaign on Soneium from now to the future** and help Aave bootstrap liquidity on Soneium.\n  * We have been working on a 100M-[ASTR](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/astar/) (worth of $4M now) liquidity incentive campaign for mainnet launch at the moment as a starter, which can include Aave if Aave's deployment timeline aligns. More details can be found [here](https://forum.astar.network/t/treasury-proposal-for-acs-campaign/7806).\n\n## Technical Feasibility\n\n1. Seamless Integration and Compatibility with v3:\n\n  * Soneium is an EVM-equivalent Ethereum L2 built using OP Stack, which means Ethereum smart contracts are fully compatible.\n\n2. Chainlink Integration:\n\n  * Chainlink has deployed Chainlink Data Feeds and Chainlink Data Streams on Soneium, supporting a wide variety of assets including BTC, ETH, wstETH, USDC, etc.\n\n3. The Graph Integration:\n\n  * The Graph has integrated with Soneium and has Full Protocol Support for data indexing on Soenum.\n\n4. Development and Testing\n\n  * Startale Group will assist Aave’s technical team through its Integration and Support team to ensure a smooth integration.\n\n5. Security Audits:\n\n  * Startale Group will cooperate with the Aave DAO in order to run audits to ensure that the deployment meets all security requirements, should this be requested by the DAO.\n\n## Deployment Plan\n\n1. Phase 1: Initial Discussion\n\n  * Gather community feedback through this TEMP CHECK.\n\n2. Phase 2: Detailed Proposal\n\n  * If the TEMP CHECK indicates positive support, submit a detailed ARFC (Aave Request for Comment) outlining the technical, economic, and security aspects of the integration.\n\n3. Phase 3: Implementation and Monitoring\n\n  * Upon eventual approval, deploy Aave V3 on Soneium and monitor the integration closely to address any issues and ensure stability.\n\n## Risks and Mitigations:\n\n1. Technical Challenges:\n\n  * Startale Group will work closely with Aave’s developers and service providers to address any technical challenges during integration.\n\n2. Security Risks:\n\n  * We are open to conducting security and risk audits to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with this proposal and deployment. Startale Group will be available to address raised concerns, and support these potential audits.\n\n3. Community Adoption:\n\n  * Soneium and Astar will activate its community to engage with the Aave community ensuring support and adoption. Also it will work aligned with the Aave community to engage and attract users to Soneium.\n\n## Call to Action:\n\nWe invite the Aave community to express their support or concerns regarding this TEMP CHECK. Your feedback is crucial in determining whether to proceed with a detailed ARFC for the Aave V3 deployment on Soneium, and will help us ensure that the integration aligns with Aave’s goals and community interests.\n\n## Useful Links:\n\nSoneium Website: https://soneium.org/\n\nSoneium L2Beat: https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/soneium\n\nSoneium Blockscout: https://soneium.blockscout.com/\n\nSoneium Defillama: https://defillama.com/chain/Soneium\n\nSony Block Solution Labs Website: https://www.sonynetwork.co.jp/sonynetworkcomlabs/en/\n\nSony Web3 Solution: [Launch of a comprehensive blockchain-centric Web3 solution](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202501/25-002E/)\n\nStartale Group Website: https://startale.com/en\n\nACS Liquidity Incentive Campaign: https://forum.astar.network/t/treasury-proposal-for-acs-campaign/7806\n\nAave Documentation: https://aave.com/docs\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

Holders of *tETH* earn real yield in excess of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage while still being able to use *tETH* for DeFi activities. *tETH* is also foundational to supporting the implementation of Decentralized Offered Rates (DOR).\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nAssets like tETH are designed to unify fragmented interest rate markets and optimize yield generation. Users contribute ETH and receive tETH, redeemable for their initial ETH plus additional yield. This yield comes from a dynamic strategy that balances staking rewards and interest rate arbitrage on lending protocols. For tETH, this ensures baseline yields equivalent to native ETH staking while capturing additional returns from rate inefficiencies. These assets are composable across DeFi, enabling broader usability.\n\nBy onboarding tETH to Aave V3 Prime Instance, we can:\n\n- **Enhance capital efficiency**: Users can borrow against tETH, unlocking liquidity while continuing to earn restaking rewards.\n- **Increase protocol revenue**: More borrowing activity leads to higher interest income for Aave.\n- **Expand Aave’s influence in restaking finance**: Positioning Aave as a central lending hub for LRTs.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nRisk Parameters will be updated by Risk Service Providers at ARFC stage, and ARFC will be updated accordingly. \n\n## Useful links\n\nhttps://www.treehouse.finance/\n\nhttps://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol/teth/introduction\n\n# Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is directly powered by ACI (Aave Chan Initiative). ACI did not received compensation for creation of this proposal.\n\n# Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

        "body": "---\n\nTitle: [TEMP CHECK] Deploy Aave V3 on Mode \nAuthor: ACI (Aave Chan Initiative)\nDate: 2024-05-23\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nMode is a state-of-the-art, modular L2 blockchain that builds on the Ethereum network via deployment on the OP Superchain. \n\nDeploying Aave on Mode involves setting up a new instance of the Aave protocol on the Mode L2 blockchain, which is positioned to be the DeFi hub of the OP Superchain. This proposal aims to leverage Mode's modular infrastructure tailored for DeFi applications, offering potential enhancements in scalability and interoperability within the ecosystem.\n\n## **Motivation/Background**\n\nMode intends to be the DeFi hub of the Superchain, offering a best-in-class yield experience by attracting cutting edge and innovative DeFi protocols to weave into and build atop of a solid foundation of trusted blue chip favorites, Velodrome, Balancer en route, and (hopefully soon-to-be) Aave.\n\nMode stands apart in its approach to DeFi and liquidity architecture by working closely with stalwart protocols and teams to push integrations and intra-chain operability. By keeping an extremely active presence in the telegram channels and engaging in transformative open dialogue, Mode harnesses the collective wisdom of its builders to design an L2 every DeFi user would be proud to call home. Mode currently has baked-in incentives to help bootstrap early protocols via an ongoing metric based DevDrop which is redistributed to users, as well as Sequencer Fee Sharing, which passes a portion of fees back to the protocols.\n\nSince its Mainnet inception in early 2024, Mode has attracted significant TVL from the BTC L2 ecosystems as well as popular LRTs in the Ethereum AVS sector. Mode has risen into the Top 15 by TVL on DefiLlama, with a current USDC stablecoin dominance. The next priority is supporting more yield bearing assets, both volatile and stable, to enable automated vault strategies, yield markets, and more powerful index synthetics.\n\n### **1. Benefits of deploying to Mode:**\n\n**Scalability**:\n\n- Utilizes Mode's L2 solutions to reduce gas fees and transaction times, enhancing user experience and adoption.\n- Mode has been recognized for having some of the most affordable transaction rates among Layer 2 solutions, which can significantly attract more users to Aave.\n\n**Security**:\n\n- Features a robust multisig management system with oversight from the Mode Security Council, the Optimism Security Council, and the Optimism Foundation.\n- This setup prevents unilateral control over significant changes, providing a secure and stable environment for financial operations.\n- Includes rapid incident response capabilities through a partnership with Optimism, enabling quick technical interventions and smart contract upgrades to maintain system integrity.\n\n**Interoperability**:\n\n- Boasts EVM compatibility and is equipped with LayerZero OFT technology (with upcoming CCIP enablement), facilitating seamless integrations and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem and extending to Bitcoin L2s (like Merlin chain).\n\n**Strategic Significance**:\n\n- Aligns with Mode's modular infrastructure which is optimized for scalability and interoperability, enhancing the overall functionality and reach of Aave.\n- Supports Mode's strategic goals to become the DeFi hub of the Superchain, leveraging its ecosystem to foster significant growth and innovation for both Aave and Mode.\n- Compelling access to BTC synthetics, leveraging Mode’s maturing relationship with Bitcoin Layer 2s.\n- Deploying one of the fastest growing L2s in the space, Mode currently sits within the Top 15 by TVL on DefiLlama.\n\n### **2. Why it makes sense for Aave and Mode to pursue this new deployment.**\n\n**Effects on Liquidity**\n\n- **Increased Asset Pool**: Integration with Mode L2 allows Aave to leverage Mode’s significant m-BTC liquidity and other assets, potentially enhancing the variety and volume in Aave’s lending markets.\n- **Diverse Liquidity Sources**: The presence of synthetic Bitcoin as well as popular LRTs already on Mode broaden the liquidity base, making Aave’s market more versatile.\n\n**User Adoption**\n\n- **Lowered Cost and Enhanced UX**: Mode’s low transaction fees and optimized user interface are likely to attract both existing and new DeFi users to Aave, increasing the protocol’s adoption.\n- **Community Engagement**: Mode’s proactive community outreach and education will aid in effectively onboarding new users to Aave, fostering a deeper understanding and longer-term user retention. Established DeFi players also feel more comfortable depositing in AAVE versus newer protocols, which should spur growth.\n\n**Overall Market Growth**\n\n- **Market Expansion**: Aave’s integration into Mode’s DeFi-centric infrastructure contributes significantly to the broader adoption and growth of the DeFi market on Mode L2, likely to attract fresh capital from other chains who were otherwise waiting for Aave’s deployment.\n- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Mode’s infrastructure supports higher transaction volumes and operational efficiency, a boost for Aave’s scalability and ability to serve more users without compromising on performance.\n\n**Impact on Mode's Liquidity**\n\n- **Enhanced Platform Value**: Aave’s robust lending options add substantial value to Mode’s platform, enhancing overall liquidity and financial activity.\n- **Synergistic Effects**: Aave’s deployment can attract additional protocols and assets that seek to utilize Aave’s liquidity in yield-bearing architecture, thereby enriching Mode’s entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Contribution to Aave's Growth**\n\n- **Strategic Expansion**: Deploying on Mode aligns with Aave’s strategy to innovate within the DeFi space, using Mode’s advanced L2 solutions to access new markets and user bases.\n- **Long-term Benefits**: Integration with Mode’s diverse assets and user-friendly infrastructure is expected to sustain Aave’s growth and presence in the competitive DeFi market.\n\n### **3. Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments**\n\nMode will take several steps in ensuring deep liquidity is deposited to Aave upon deployment.\n\n- Mode will integrate Aave into the Mode dashboard (100,000 daily visits) and points program, which has been a key driver of TVL for Mode applications.\n- Mode will work with existing and new LPs to bootstrap pools.\n- Mode will work with LRT partners to include Aave in ongoing dual incentive campaigns\n- Mode will include Aave in Optimism related incentive campaigns\n\n## **Useful Links:**\n\nWebsite: https://www.mode.network/\n\nL2 Beat: https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/modeDefiLlama: https://defillama.com/chain/Mode\n\n## Disclaimer:\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Mode and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this [TEMP CHECK], escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, this proposal will be escalated to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n## Copyright:\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",
