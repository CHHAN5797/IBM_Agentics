        "body": "## **Author: ACI**\n\n## **Date: 2024-10-04**\n\n---\n\n### **Simple Summary:**\n\nThe current TEMP CHECK aims to onboard EIGEN, the native token of Eigenlayer, in Aave V3 Ethereum Market. This onboarding will allow Aave users to supply and borrow EIGEN, thereby enhancing the utility and liquidity of the Eigenlayer token within the DeFi ecosystem and more specifically, within the Aave ecosystem.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEigenlayer is a protocol focused on shared security and restaking, enabling Ethereum stakers to extend their security guarantees to multiple services and protocols. EIGEN is the governance and utility token for Eigenlayer, playing a critical role in the network’s operations, staking mechanisms, and protocol governance. By onboarding EIGEN to Aave V3, we aim to create new opportunities for Aave users to engage with this emerging staking ecosystem, while expanding EIGEN's liquidity.\n\n**Benefits of listing that token:** \n\nProvide opportunities for Aave users to borrow against their EIGEN to unlock liquidity, or alternatively to borrow EIGEN against other collateral allowing them to stake it in the Eigenlayer ecosystem to earn rewards.\n\n**Market Impact:** \n\nWe see no significant market impact from onboarding EIGEN except for providing new opportunities to Aave users which may cause users to switch from borrowing other tokens against their collateral. Overall we see onboarding EIGEN as net good for Aave users as it expands opportunities for them to engage in a new, important ecosystem.\n\n**Chain to be deployed/listed:** \n\nEthereum Mainnet\n\n**Proof of Liquidity (POL) and Deposit Commitments:** \n\nPOL and Deposit Commitments will be discussed at the ARFC stage.\n\n### **Useful Links:**\n\n- [Eigenlayer website](https://eigenfoundation.org/)\n- [Eigenlayer documentation](https://docs.eigenfoundation.org/category/faq-eigen-token-overview)\n\n### **Disclaimer:**\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards. The Aave Chan Initiative is not directly affiliated with Eigenlayer Foundation and did not receive compensation for creation this proposal.\n\nACI and ACI employees may be holders of EIGEN.\n\n### **Next Steps:**\n\n1. If consensus is reached on this TEMP CHECK, escalate this proposal to the Snapshot stage.\n2. If the Snapshot outcome is YAE, escalate to ARFC stage.\n3. Publication of a standard ARFC, collect community & service providers feedback before escalating proposal to ARFC snapshot stage.\n4. If the ARFC snapshot outcome is YAE, publish an AIP vote for final confirmation and enforcement of the proposal.\n\n### **Copyright:**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

EURC is Circle’s EUR-backed stablecoin, enhancing liquidity and expanding the platform’s appeal to European users. Original proposal is [**[TEMP CHECK] Add EURC to BASE Aave V3**](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-add-eurc-to-base-aave-v3/20423) but has been reformatted to be governance compliant.\n\n### **Motivation/Background:**\n\nEURC is a fully backed stablecoin pegged to the Euro, issued by Circle, the same entity behind USDC. It is a reliable and transparent Euro-denominated asset gaining adoption across DeFi protocols.\n\n- **Utility and Role:** EURC facilitates Euro-based transactions in DeFi, allowing for a stable store of value and an efficient medium of exchange within the ecosystem.\n- **Backers:** Circle is a trusted issuer with a track record of regulatory compliance, providing confidence in EURC’s stability.\n- **Performance:** EURC has demonstrated consistent performance and adoption within the broader DeFi space such as Morpho (3M), Alien(4M) and Aerodome (3M).\n- **Euro Liquidity:** EURC will offer Aave users access to Euro-denominated liquidity, appealing to the European market.\n- **Broader User Base:** Listing EURC could attract new users from Europe, diversifying Aave’s stablecoin offerings.\n- **Increased Liquidity:** The addition of EURC can enhance liquidity across Aave’s markets, improving lending, borrowing, and trading experiences.\n\n### **Chain to be Deployed/Listed:**\n\n- **Chain:** Base\n- **Parameters:** Initial Risk Parameters will be provided by Risk service providers during the ARFC phase.\n\n### Useful Links\n\nProject: [Circle | USDC & Web3 Services for a new financial system](https://www.circle.com/en/)\n\nDocumentation: [EURC | A Euro-Backed Stablecoin](https://www.circle.com/en/eurc)\n\nBase Contract: 0x60a3e35cc302bfa44cb288bc5a4f316fdb1adb42\n\nBase Chainlink Oracle: [EURC / USD Price Feed | Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/feeds/base/base/eurc-usd)\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis proposal is powered by Skywards.

By implementing this change, we seek to enhance capital efficiency for borrowers using eBTC/WBTC as collateral.\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nThe motivation behind this proposal stems from several key factors:\n\n- High Utilization: eBTC/WBTC has demonstrated significant usage as collateral for borrowing stablecoins on the platform.\n- Capital Efficiency: Enabling liquid E-Mode for eBTC/WBTC will allow borrowers to substantially improve their capital efficiency when using this asset as collateral.\n- Controlled Growth: Liquid E-Mode provides a mechanism for more precise control over the growth and borrow demand in relation to the overall stablecoin liquidity within Aave v3 on Core Instance.\n- Enhanced Borrowing Capacity: This change will enable users to borrow larger amounts of other stablecoins against their eBTC/WBTC collateral, potentially increasing platform utilization and revenue.\n\nBy implementing this proposal, we aim to optimize the use of eBTC/WBTC within the Aave ecosystem, attracting more liquidity.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nThis proposal will add eBTC/WBTC liquid E-Mode. Risk Parameters will be provided by Risk Service Providers and ARFC will be updated accordingly when ARFC is posted.\n\n## Useful links\n\n[**BGD.
