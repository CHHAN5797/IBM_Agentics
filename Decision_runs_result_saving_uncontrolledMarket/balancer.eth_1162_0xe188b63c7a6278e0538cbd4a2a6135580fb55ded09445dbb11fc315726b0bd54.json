[Treehouse’s tETH-wstETH pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/ethereum/v2/0x1d13531bf6344c102280ce4c458781fbf14dad140000000000000000000006df) on Ethereum Mainnet successfully reached a TVL of $7M, with the gauge being a key driver of this success. We are confident that implementing a similar gauge will enable us to replicate this TVL on Arbitrum.\n\n# Motivation:\n\nTreehouse is expanding its tETH offering to Arbitrum as part of our mission to enhance accessibility and reduce onboarding costs for tETH users. We have bridged tETH to Arbitrum and are in the process of establishing a Balancer pool. To further bolster liquidity, Treehouse Protocol is working to set up the tETH-wstETH (Arbitrum) Gauge on Balancer. Having a gauge will draw liquidity for our pool, and will be critical for facilitating seamless transactions for our protocol on Arbitrum.\n\n# Specifications\n\n1. **Governance:**\nAll ownable contracts are secured with a 5/7 multi-sig. Only the tETH contract is upgradable for future expansion plans.\n2. **Oracles:**\ntETH-wstETH exchange rate provider is based on wstETH as a base asset, it is not compatible with any pools aside from a wstETH pairing for the intended use of a rate provider.\n  1. tETH-wstETH Exchange Rate / Arbitrum\n    1. https://arbiscan.io/address/0x98a977Ba31C72aeF2e15B950Eb5Ae3158863D856.\n3. **Audits:**\nTreehouse Protocol has been audited by entities such as Fuzzland, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits. The reports can be viewed in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report).\n4. **Centralization vectors:**\nThe centralization vector primarily involves the execution of actions in the strategy contract, which is done by a multi-sig appointed by the contract owner. However, all action contracts are well-defined, and the executors can only perform the whitelisted actions included in the strategy contract.\n5. **Market History:**\ntETH has reached a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $360M since its launch on 10th September 2024. The tETH-wstETH Balancer pool has been in inception since 23 October 2024. More information about tETH and the Treehouse Protocol ecosystem can be found on our [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/treehouseprotocol/treehousefi).\n\ntETH-wstETH pool on Arbitrum: https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x65c2d90b33f7bf693a7ef54662435f2cf3251c210000000000000000000005e7                \n— Child gauge https://arbiscan.io/address/0xc7995A4bA51574Ecd93e777cded6900ce42ff805#code and.                                          \n— root gauge https://etherscan.io/address/0x870D8Fd230a6261DB8d4C168038E55AE3a7Eb4B2\n\n6. **Value:**\nThe tETH-wstETH pool on Balancer is designed to be a key source of liquidity for the token on the Arbitrum network. By pairing tETH with wstETH, the pool aims to provide a seamless trading experience while also offering enhanced rewards for liquidity providers. This structure is intended to optimize both liquidity and profitability within the ecosystem. In addition, users who stake their tETH-wstETH LP tokens will be able to earn points from our current ongoing points program.\n\n# Relevant Links\n\n* [Website](https://treehouse.finance/)\n* [dApp](https://app.treehouse.finance/)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/treehousefi)\n* [Twitter](https://x.com/TreehouseFi)\n* [Docs](https://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol)\n* [Github](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/tETH)\n* [Audits](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n### Technical Specification\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `e0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the addGauge function with the following arguments: gauge(address):`0x870D8Fd230a6261DB8d4C168038E55AE3a7Eb4B2` \ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

Holders of tETH earn real yield in excess of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage while still being able to use tETH for DeFi activities. \n\nThe Treehouse Protocol team proposes a Balancer Gauge for the tETH-wstETH pool on Ethereum with no emissions cap. \n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> Link to:\n\n* Website - [Treehouse | Decentralized Fixed Income Layer](https://treehouse.finance/)\n* Documentation - [Treehouse Finance Docs](https://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol) \n* CoinGecko - [tETH](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/treehouse-eth)\n*  Github Page - [Treehouse - gaia](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia)\n* Discord - [Treehouse](https://discord.com/invite/treehousefi)\n* Twitter - [x.com](https://x.com/TreehouseFi)\n* Gauge deposit contract - [tETH/wstETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf697535848B535900c76f70F1e36EC3985D27862)\n* Protocol Audits - [Treehouse audits](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nTreehouse is a protocol that is building the decentralized fixed income layer for digital assets. Its main product offerings, tAssets and the Decentralized Offered Rate (DOR), were developed to address a critical gap in the fixed income digital assets market and set a standard for decentralized reference rates.\n\ntETH, the first tAsset deployed on the Ethereum mainnet, is a liquid staking token (LST) that converges the fragmented on-chain ETH interest rates market. Holders of tETH earn real yield exceeding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rewards through interest rate arbitrage across various lending and borrowing protocols, all while retaining the ability to use tETH for other DeFi activities.\n\nSince its launch, the tETH vault has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140 million worth of ETH within just a month and a half.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nTreehouse Protocol is working to establish the tETH-wstETH Gauge on Balancer to enhance the liquidity of tETH. Increased liquidity facilitates smoother entry and exit for traders and investors, which is essential for the overall usability and appeal of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) within the DeFi ecosystem. This liquidity boost not only supports market efficiency but also attracts more participants to the Balancer ecosystem, where the tETH-wstETH pool will generate yield for both liquidity providers and Balancer.\n\n**Specifications:**\n \n1. **Governance:** All ownable contracts are secured with a 5/7 multi-sig. Only the tETH contract is upgradable for future expansion plans.\n\n2. **Oracles:** [tETH-wstETH rate provider](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7c53f86d9a6b01821f916802a7606e9255dfe4e2) is based on wstETH as a base asset, it is not compatible with any pools aside from a wstETH pairing for the intended use of a rate provider.\n\n4. **Audits:** Treehouse Protocol has been audited by entities such as Fuzzland, Sigma Prime, and Trail of Bits and the reports can be seen in the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/treehouse-gaia/audit-report)\n\n5. **Centralization vectors:** The centralization vector primarily involves the execution of actions in the strategy contract which are done by a multi-sig appointed by the contract owner. However, all action contracts are well-defined and the executors can only perform the whitelisted actions included in the strategy contract.\n\n6. **Market History:** tETH has accumulated a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $140M worth of ETH since its launch on 10th September 2024.

        "body": "### PR with Payload\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/398\n\n**Summary:**\n\n> This pool uses the composable stable pool factory v5 and contains two separate linear pool tokens; bb-a-USDC and bb-a-USDC. These are Balancer’s AAVE boosted Arbitrum native USDC, and bridged USDC. As Circle migrates from bridged to native USDC there are several dexes offering the ability to swap between both assets, which do bring in considerable volume. Balancer protocol will be earning yield on both boosted portions of this pool, making the token pairing more efficient for LPs. This gauge would enter as a “core pool” under BIP-19, meaning protocol fees earned by this pool would be used to bribe for votes on it. The gauge can be uncapped.\n\n**References/Useful links:**\n\n> USDC: Link to:\n> • [Website ](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc)\n> • [Documentation ](https://developers.circle.com/docs/what-is-usdc)\n> • [Github Page ](https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens)\n> • [Communities ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usd-coin) - Coingecko link\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n> bb-a-USDC is a Balancer’s USDC boosted token implementation of USDC, leveraging AAVE’s boosted strategy. USDCe is bridged USDC from mainnet to Arbitrum.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\n> This provides a trading route between the two USDC assets on Arbitrum. With the boosted aspect, an A of 5000, and swap fee of 0.005%, this swap route highly competitive, and more sustainable for liquidity providers to place their funds. The risk of a high A factor exposing the pool to being off balance is mute due the assets being virtually interchangeable. Competitors use higher swap fees and see utilization upwards of 100%. \n\n**Specifications:**\n\n1. **Governance:** USDC is centralized and does not have a governance forum. \n2. **Oracles:** This pool only relies on the rate providers of the linear pools to inform when yield is earned.\n3. **Audits:** N/A\n4. **Centralization vectors:** USDC is inherently centralized. \n5. **Market History:** See [here ](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdc).\n6. **Value:** Balancer will earn the protocol fee on underlying bb-a-USDC and bb-a-USDCe yield. BIP-19 will incentivize TVL to continue to grow here with trading volume and this implementation will continue to draw in new volume, as well as showcase the power of these pool types.\n\nLink to pool [0x9ceBf13BB702F253AbF1579294694A1eDAD00EAA](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x9cebf13bb702f253abf1579294694a1edad00eaa000000000000000000000486)\nLink to gauge: [0x90DDAa2A6D192Db2F47195d847626F94E940c7Ac](https://etherscan.io/address/0x90DDAa2A6D192Db2F47195d847626F94E940c7Ac)\n\n**Specification:**\n\nThe Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the `GaugeAdderv4` at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n\ngauge(address): `0x90DDAa2A6D192Db2F47195d847626F94E940c7Ac`\n\ngaugeType(string): `Arbitrum`",

        "body": "**Summary**\n\n> This is a proposal to enable one uncapped Balancer gauge on Base for a weETH/wstETH E-CLP. The pool will have a swap fee of 5bps, of which 5% are forwarded to Balancer as protocol fees.\n\n**References/Useful links**\n\n> Links\n>\n>\n>\n> * [Documentation of E-CLPs](https://docs.gyro.finance/gyroscope-protocol/concentrated-liquidity-pools/e-clps)\n> * [Website](https://gyro.finance/)\n> * [Github](https://github.com/gyrostable)\n> * [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2vnqnS7wE6)\n> * [X](https://twitter.com/GyroStable)\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\n> * weETH is an ETH LST, issued by [EtherFi](https://www.ether.fi/).\n> * wstETH is an ETH LST, issued by [Lido](https://lido.fi/).\n\n**Motivation**\n\n> This weETH/wstETH pool on Base is intended to complement a [similar pool on Arbitrum](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0xcdcef9765d369954a4a936064535710f7235110a000200000000000000000558).\n\n**Specification**\n\n> 1. **Governance:** The Gyroscope Protocol will be governed by a DAO and relevant stakeholder with the full launch on Ethereum. For now, the FTL Labs multi-sig can pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee. As a custom pool by Gyroscope, the E-CLP will be controlled by Gyroscope governance upon its launch.\n> 2. **Oracles:**\n>\n>\n>\n> * ‘rateProvider0’ for weETH: [0x5a7A419C59eAAdec8Dc00bc93ac95612e6e154Cf](https://basescan.org/address/0x5a7A419C59eAAdec8Dc00bc93ac95612e6e154Cf)\n> * ‘rateProvider1’ for wstETH: [0x3b3dd5f913443bb5E70389F29c83F7DCA460CAe1](https://basescan.org/address/0x3b3dd5f913443bb5E70389F29c83F7DCA460CAe1)\n>  * both rate providers are Chainlink feeds and [whitelisted](https://github.com/balancer/code-review/blob/29855a56d89abcf3c91243e2f2ee4729c68e29cd/rate-providers/registry.json).\n>\n>\n>\n> 3. **Audits:** Audit reports by Nethermind, Trail of Bits, and Runtime Verification can be accessed here (the E-CLP is called the “CEMM” in these reports). In addition, the E-CLP code has been live in production since November 2022.\n> 4. **Centralization vectors:** No centralization vectors. The FTL Labs team’s multi-sig can - currently - pause the pool, change the swap fee and set the protocol fee.\n> 5. **Market History:** This USDC/GYD pool has a tighter range than the previously deployed [USDC/GYD pool](https://app.gyro.finance/pools/ethereum/e-clp/0xc2aa60465bffa1a88f5ba471a59ca0435c3ec5c1/) who has currently 1.3m USD in TVL.\n> 6. **Value:** This pool is intended to better match the historic prices and low volatility of the included tokens.\n\n#### Contracts\n\n> * E-CLP: [0x49470d9e531c52E4370F4cdC7afE5acCbbD9222D](https://basescan.org/address/0x49470d9e531c52E4370F4cdC7afE5acCbbD9222D)\n> * Root Gauge on Ethereum: [0x17c67CA47d472d16FBc09f0A0408edeE22180cEe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x17c67CA47d472d16FBc09f0A0408edeE22180cEe)\n> * Child Gauge on Base: [0x7d08152dE696a5D44Ef032f9626e158048a408B1]( https://basescan.org/address/0x7d08152dE696a5D44Ef032f9626e158048a408B1)\n\n\n#### Specification\n\n> Transaction: The Balancer Maxi LM Multisig `eth:0xc38c5f97B34E175FFd35407fc91a937300E33860` will interact with the GaugeAdderv4 at `0x5DbAd78818D4c8958EfF2d5b95b28385A22113Cd` and call the `addGauge` function with the following arguments:\n>\n>\n>\n> gauge(address): `0x17c67CA47d472d16FBc09f0A0408edeE22180cEe`\n> gaugeType(string): `Base`",
