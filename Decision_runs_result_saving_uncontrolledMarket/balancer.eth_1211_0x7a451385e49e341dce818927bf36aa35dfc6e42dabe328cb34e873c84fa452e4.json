        "title": "[BIP-362] Restructure the Joint Balancer / Beethoven X Deployment on Optimism",
        "author": "0x9f74662aD05840Ba35d111930501c617920dD68e",
        "body": "Authors: Beethoven X contributors (composers and music directors)\n\nThis proposal presents an opportunity to position Balancer and Aura as the leading forces of technology on Optimism. It aims to seize the upcoming launch of Aura to leverage cross-chain Balancer boosts, restructures the network's liquidity, and propel Balancer, Beethoven X, and Aura toward increased market dominance. This proposal seeks to do so by proposing a modified protocol fee structure and core pool framework, similar to other successful Balancer deployments.\n\n**Background and Motivation**\n\nOptimism's bedrock upgrade has transformed the Superchain thesis into reality. With the impending Base Launch and the continuous development of the OP stack, we believe Optimism is poised to attract greater attention and liquidity. With the launch of Aura, these developments present an opportunity to cement the joint Balancer and Beethoven X deployment as a core technology and liquidity host on the network.\n\nSince the approval of the Beethoven X friendly fork of Balancer in November 2021, the partnership between the two protocols has flourished into a truly unique relationship. Nowhere else in DeFi has a fork become an essential SP of the original protocol. For the last year, we have recognized we are stronger when we work together, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve and building a better ecosystem along the way. If we look back, the joint Optimism deployment was the pivotal milestone in the expanding relationship between these two protocols. \n\nSince its launch in July 2022, the joint Balancer and Beethoven X Optimism deployment has demonstrated its innovative prowess, becoming the primary host of LST liquidity, amassing $60 million in TVL in April 2023, and generating approximately $370k in protocol revenue. While these metrics are indeed commendable, there is room for improvement. With the recent emergence of L2 veBAL Boost powered by LayerZero, there is the opportunity to leverage the impending launch of Aura and make considerable improvements to network market share. \n\nThis proposal seeks to optimize the current incentive structure to coincide with Aura's launch. Specifically, it aims to restructure the distribution of protocol fees to bootstrap an enhanced liquidity flywheel on the network and adopt a modified Balancer core pool model per BIP-19, supplemented by Beethoven X’s Optimism grant.\n\n**Current Protocol Fee Distribution**\n\nIn line with other Balancer deployments, the joint Balancer/Beethoven X deployment currently allocates 50% of swap fees and yield capture as protocol fees, with the remaining portion directed towards LPs. Based on initial governance approvals, both DAOs agreed to a [50](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xd281d8cad43c97814b2496270498c4396b16c0f2ce522d5bc554aae9fed4e4d7) / [50](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x2856e059b7bf581ee97ce63b36d79d85c3f27910ec5c79115de3d0d9fadc948c) split of the protocol fees as part of the joint deployment.\n\nBeethovenX's governance adopted an [additional proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/beets.eth/proposal/0x94ca4387a061af6df49ce3fefd9439e7399e7af152c59b56b370a43705eed4c1), where it committed to allocate 50% of its share of the protocol fees, converted to OP, matched with Beethoven X's OP grant, and emitted to pools as liquidity mining or gauge incentives. In certain instances when positive ROI was achieved, these incentives were directed towards Hidden Hand's OP vlAURA gauge market, but have more often been used as direct liquidity incentives.\n\nBeethoven X's grant-matching approach is a sustainable incentive model designed for long-term success. Other partnerships, such as Rocket Pool, have played a pivotal role in bootstrapping liquidity by directing their OP grants toward Optimism pools. However, the joint deployment has faced limitations in competing with the incentives provided by other protocols due to the number of incentives the joint deployment can currently emit based on the portion of protocol revenue flowing to Beethoven X.\n\n**The Value of Optimism Deployment**\n\nFrom January 1 to June 30, 2023, approximately $77.8k in BAL rewards have been emitted to OP pools through veBAL, while Balancer's revenue share directed towards the DAO treasury amounted to approximately $125.5k, resulting in a positive net cash flow. During the same period, Beethoven X incentivized pools with $56.6k worth of BEETS tokens, recycling half ($62.8k) as incentives from its share of protocol fees matched with OP.\n\nWith the anticipated launch of Aura and cross-chain veBAL boosts, Beethoven X, Balancer, and Aura will unlock more efficient means to foster liquidity growth. Historically, Aura has provided the Balancer ecosystem with an additional liquidity layer enabling efficient vote markets. As such, Beethoven X's current OP grant matching program can shift to being deployed as gauge vote incentives to direct BAL and AURA emissions to increase protocol TVL efficiently. If voting market efficiencies reduce, the incentive program can continue to emit direct liquidity mining incentives on pools. Aura has also [proposed an OP grant](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-28011280168279695) that would direct additional direct LP incentives or match bounties placed on any Aura voting markets with OP.\n\nBy leveraging the cross-chain veBAL boost and providing an efficient liquidity layer, combined with potential OP matching, Aura is a growth catalyst for the Balancer and Beethoven X deployment. With these additional optimizations to our incentive systems, we can ensure that our entire ecosystem substantially increases market share and revenue potential on Optimism.\n\n**Core Pool Framework**\n\nThe Balancer Core Pool Framework implemented through [BIP-19](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0x28bd2c5580f5a8effacdceb0aec52e9bc63987fa4f4a39f8b8223257ca4376cc), allows us to designate certain pools as \"core pools.\" Under this framework, protocol fees earned on other Balancer L2 deployments are utilized as gauge incentives for core pools on those networks, accelerating the adoption of L2s within the Balancer Ecosystem. BIP-19 was approved to collect and allocate 65% of the fees of all pools and proportionately direct them as gauge incentives to each L2's core pools to bootstrap their liquidity.\n\nGauge Framework v1, as proposed in [BIP-57](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-57-introduce-gauge-framework-v1/3604), introduced rating criteria for the Balancer community to evaluate all current and future veBAL gauges. This framework incorporates an \"overall\" factor, derived from the \"weight\" factor and \"market cap\" factor, as well as a \"revenue\" factor. It imposes a 2% cap, 10% cap, or no cap to gauges.\n\nBIPs-19 and 57 have also been applied to designate at least two 80/20 pools, Radiant and Alchemix, as uncapped core pools, in lieu of receiving ve80/20 grants\n\nThis proposal aims to adopt these frameworks for the Balancer/Beethoven X deployment on Optimism. However, we propose a modification to the distribution system: Rather than distributing incentives between core pools based on TVL, we propose incentives are distributed based on protocol fees generated by each pool, a calculation that can be efficiently derived using the [Beethoven X dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c).\n\n**Specification**\n\nThis proposal seeks to ensure that we bootstrap the launch of Aura in the most efficient way possible with two changes.\n\n1. Adopting a modified version of Balancer’s protocol fee distribution\n2. Establishing an Optimism core pool framework\n\n**Adopting Modified Version of Balancer’s Protocol Fee Distribution.**\n\nWe propose the joint Beethoven X / Balancer deployment on Optimism adopts the same 65/35 Protocol Fee distribution structure as other Balancer deployments: 65% of the fees used as incentives on the vote market for Optimism pools, and 35% goes to DAOs, with an equal split between Beethoven X and Balancer. \n\nIf approved, this action would take place as soon as possible to capitalize on Aura’s launch on the network. 65% of the fees would be utilized to buy OP and direct OP as voting incentives for core pools. The resulting action would see 65% of all protocol fees paired with OP from the Beethoven-X/Balancer OP grant, meaning a net 130% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives. \n\nThere is also the potential for further matching from Aura’s OP grant request. If Aura’s OP grant is also approved, this would see a net 260% of protocol fees distributed as voting incentives for vlAura voters while the grants are active. Voters will see an increase in voting incentives that go towards pools of Optimism with the potential to increase even further with every voting cycle due to the positive flywheel effect.\n\nProtocol fees are currently collected every two weeks with all fees sent to the Beethoven X Treasury on Optimism automatically. Balancer DAOs share is then bridged to the Balancer Treasury on Mainnet. The proposal aims to keep this procedure to streamline the process of OP grant matching, with OP directed towards voting incentives for vlAura voters, or as direct Liquidity mining incentives depending on voting efficiencies. \n\n**Adapting the Core Pool Framework for Optimism**\n\nThe Optimism deployment will adhere to the Balancer Core Pool Framework that is in place for all other chains. However, we propose to add a slight change to the distribution mechanism: Instead of distributing the voting incentives based on the TVL of the pools, we propose to distribute incentives based on fees (yield and swap fees) generated over the previous two weeks. Beethoven-X has developed a [dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/ce0e46c4-fd56-4512-beca-3cb6ffd24b11/page/p_0ju2jia06c) that details a pool's contribution to fees and the resulting incentive distribution those pools will receive. While distributing incentives based on TVL is a good approximation, using fees as the underlying data is more accurate.\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following existing pools would be designated as core pools:\n\n* Rocket Fuel (reth/eth metastable)\n* Shanghai Shakedown (wsteth/eth metastable)\n* Tri-Sonne Harmonic Crescendo (bb-so-wbtc/bb-so-wsteth/bb-so-usdc weighted pool)\n* Gyroscope ECLP (wstETH/WETH)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n* For this BIP to become active, Aura must launch on Optimism, which is planned very soon.\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n\nVia redirecting a portion of Balancer's protocol fees to voting incentives for veBAL / vlAURA voters, the net percentage of protocol fees flowing to the Balancer DAO treasury as well as Beethoven X DAO treasury will be reduced to 17.5%.\n\nWhile this reduces potential future treasury runway, it also has the potential to bootstrap the TVL of pools that contribute considerably to revenue. Paired with a cross-chain Balancer boost, Aura’s Liquidity mining boost, incentives, possible Aura OP matching, and potentially positive ROI on voting markets, yield-bearing core pools will have the potential to see a considerable increase in TVL. To add to this, these pools are unique in that an increase in TVL directly correlates to the revenue generated.",

        "body": "Payload with PR\nhttps://github.com/BalancerMaxis/multisig-ops/pull/1354\n\n# Introduction\n\nOver the last 6 months, the Maxis have transformed into a professional on-chain DevOps team, ensuring smooth operations of Balancer technology across chains as well as providing white-glove service to partners in the ecosystem. Our key success metrics are showcased by fast response times to partner requests and successful execution of many initiatives like supporting the launch of CoWAMM, the related incentive program, or the design and execution of token grants. Furthermore, we are constantly improving our technology stack with the ultimate goal of achieving self-service autonomy for most operations.\n\nGiven the Maxis are an integral part of Balancer technology and partner management, we aim to switch to bi-annual funding starting in Q4 2024. This provides us with more funding stability and also guarantees that resources for the upcoming Balancer v3 launch will be adequately allocated.\n\n# Initiatives\n\nAs with previous funding proposals, we want to make the most impact to Balancer DAO by working on key initiatives with clearly measurable objectives.\n\nAs context, you can refer to our last quarters performance reports to evaluate our progress in relation to initiatives executed in Q3 2024 ([July](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-july-2024/5907), [August](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/balancer-maxis-monthly-update-for-august-2024/5979), reports)\n\n## Initiative 1: Scale Balancer’s On-Chain DevOps Hub\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\n\nOver the last 6 months, we have taken over responsibility over most of the on-chain operations tech stack, including multi-sig management, OpenZepellin infrastructure to distribute BAL rewards, secondary incentive management as well as new chain deployments and access management.\n\nOur main focus for the next half year is to simplify and further automate any on-chain operations that the DAO has to manage. These include but are not limited to new AMM management (e.g. CoWAMMs), Balancer v3 and its corresponding new fee sweeping mechanism as well as governance operations. Two components will be crucial to drive this initiative forward: our [automation code base](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis) and our [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/).\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Operate and maintain new chain deployments for Balancer v2\n\n* Support custom infrastructure for the Balancer v2 MODE deployment incl. a dedicated MODE ve8020 gauge system on MODE network.\n* Support and integrate potential new chain deployments into our operations infrastructure such as BAL token emission scheduling through OpenZeppelin\n* Deploy and maintain any needed infrastructure to operate those chains\n\n2. Fee processing for Balancer v2\n\n* Coordinate and run fee processing of Balancer v2’s core pool framework as long as it is operational in light of the v3 launch\n* Coordinate with Mimic fee processing\n\n3. Secondary Token reward management\n\n* Build a rewards management system on Mode as part of a veMODE initiative\n* Launch a injector configuration tool on the operations UI to further improve partner management and self-service capabilities\n\n4. AURA position management\n\n* Launch a safe module to automatically relock AURA\n* Maintain the self-service module for vote placement for the BD team and design potential automation work to assign incentives without human intervention.\n\n5. Gauges and Core Pool Framework (Balancer v2)\n\n* Continued management of core pool detection and pool list curation\n* Optimization of fee structure after transitioning our focus from Balancer v2 to Balancer v3\n\n6. Management and Execution of Token Grants\n\n* Maintaining and provisioning of upcoming token distribution grants\n* Advising on how to design and execute token grant programs\n\n7. Omni-chain operations: Chainlink Automation & Gas Stations\n\n* Further optimize Chainlink upkeep monitoring and automate LINK top-ups as well as the design and development of backup systems\n* Incorporate more monitoring solutions into the [operations UI](https://balancer.defilytica.tools/chainlink-automation)\n* Establish omni-chain gas station contracts to feed all relevant dependencies with ETH (or chain gas tokens) and LINK (gas for automation jobs)\n* Collaborate with Chainlink to define and ship client-side cross-chain rate providers as well as advising on oracles for omni-chain operations.\n\n8. Analytics (v2)\n\n* Transition to maintenance mode for DeFilytica deployments\n\n9. Financial reporting (v2 & v3)\n\n* Advise on financial reporting metrics with karpatkey\n* Build and ship artifacts to monitor revenue generation on Balancer v3\n\n10. Operations UI\n\n* Full GitHub integration to propose changes from the UI\n* Completion of security review with Hypernative\n* Exploration of token whitelisting module\n* Building of tooling surrounding Balancer v2 and v3 management such as monitoring dashboards for Chainlink, Injector v2 configurator or the migration of legacy pool creators for Balancer v2\n\n## Initiative 2: Support and execute on the launch of Balancer v3 and new Products\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus, Tritium\n\n**Team**: Zen Dragon, gosuto, MikeB\n\n**Summary**\n\nBalancer v3 is planned to release between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025. The Maxis will play a crucial role in setting up key infrastructure that guarantees correct operations of the new protocol version across chains. We will collaborate with BLabs and other ecosystem partners to plan and execute a smooth launch which will include a rollout to a defined set of target chains and the subsequent management thereafter. Additionally, we will explore new revenue models and tokenomics adjustments that will have the most beneficial impact on both partners and the DAO.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Plan and execute on v3 launch\n2. Design, deploy and maintain all key infrastructure necessary to manage Balancer v3 on-chain\n* Integration tests before launch\n* Support and build a potential testnet deployment together with Balancer labs\n* Automation\n* Permission sets and monitoring\n* Fee collection mechanisms\n\n3. Fee processing for Balancer v3\n* Design and implement a new fee collection mechanism for Balancer v3, either on-chain or off-chain. Balancer v3’s new design will allow to more easily collect fees per pool and therefore has the potential to be built completely in-house and onchain\n\n4. Support and manage deployments on strategic chains\n* Work together with the BD Unit to utilize synergies in chain deployments\n* Coordinate expansion plans with ecosystem partners\n\n5. Design and execute a liquidity seeding plan with potential bootstrapping reward programs.\n* Management and execution of secondary token reward programs to bootstrap liquidity on products build on top of Balancer v3\n\n6. Support partners and builders in execution of product launches\n* Management and monitoring of creator fees in Balancer v3\n* Work to align new pool logic with users (DAOs seeking liquidity solutions)\n* Be leaders and/or available resources in the Balancer Community and Developer Ecosystem\n\n7. Design and build new analytics artifacts together with the product and data teams\n* Explore potential deployment of a native analytics platform on the native app\n* Advise service providers on how to incorporate key metric data based on partner feedback\n\n8. Advance Tokenomics and the DAOs Revenue Strategy\n* Balancer v3 offers the opportunity to rethink the current setup of Balancer’s tokenomics. The Maxis will lead any strategic workshops or workstreams together with key stakeholders in the DAO\n* Optimize the core pool framework based on the reduced BAL emission schedule that will go into effect in Q1 2025 (according to the BAL [emission schedule](https://dune.com/balancer/bal-supply))\n\n## Initiative 3: Partner Management\n\n**Co-Leads**: MikeB, Zen Dragon\n\n**Team**: Tritium, Zekraken\n\n**Summary**\n\nBalancer’s partner pipeline has experienced substantial growth across the 10 networks we support, and this momentum is expected to continue as V3 and aligned stakeholders drive new opportunities. Our partner management team's core objective is to not only sustain but also maximize the value of relationships with both current and new partners for the benefit of the DAO and veBAL holders. To achieve this, we will collaborate closely with the business development and DevOps teams to strategically enhance the partner experience and streamline the onboarding process for new partners. By leveraging our technical expertise and commercial focus, the partner management group is dedicated to providing the best possible experience for all stakeholders on the Balancer platform.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Assisting partners in pool choice, strategy, design, and launch assistance\n* Utilizing internal partners such as Cowswap and Gyroscope\n\n2. Building strong working relationships with internal partners to provide the best possible service and options to our partners.\n* Employing the advanced tech built on Balancer to provide optimal outcomes\n* ncluding Cowswap, Gyroscope, Xave, QuantAMM, hooks, boosted pools, and others as they present themselves.\n\n3. Overseeing ongoing revenue improvements to suggest to partners. I.e. swap fees, pool migrations, amplification parameters etc.\n4. Providing proactive partner support and guiding new partners through the ecosystem.\n* Governance, incentive markets, new launches and pooling opportunities.\n\n5. Rate Provider review facilitation and continuous process improvement\n6. Spearheading with the DevOps team to execute BD and partner requests not limited to, primarily related to smart contract interactions in a safe and efficient manner.\n7. Coordinating with compounders and wrappers to ensure our partners receive seamless integration to all relevant platforms. I.e. Beefy, Aura, StakeDAO.\n8. Working with various vote markets to improve partner incentive efficiencies and an agnostic approach to revenue flows through veBAL incentive platforms.\n\n### Service Provider Name & Overview: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers**: Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\nPledge to abide by [[BIP-629]](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-629-balancer-dao-service-provider-grantee-standards/5808) Balancer DAO Service Provider & Grantee Standards: Yes\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n1.

Over the last 6 months we have always been handling the discretionary portion very conservatively. In the last quarter, we only utilized approximately half of the $60k in allocated funds for Q3 2024. We will roll over ***savings from this cost point of more than $25k USDC*** and deduct them from this proposal.\n\nFurthermore, we improved our cost basis per FTE, all while we increased our headcount and capacity for the anticipated higher demand for Balancers v3 launch. Our average costs came down from an average of $13,484 $ / FTE to $13,212.50 $ / FTE (incl. BAL vests) compared to Q3 2024.\n\nA detailed breakdown of our proposed costs is visualized below:\n\n![|624x320](upload://m8DK7A5w9Ai4IkfttRSTMtu56Bs.png)\n\nWe are additionally asking for a BAL token grant of 32,738 BAL for the next half-year (at BAL price of $1.89). BAL will be locked for 1 year either as veBAL or in a veBAL wrapper such as auraBAL.\n\nQuarterly BAL allocation: $30,937.50 ( = 16,369 BAL)\n\nIn total our USDC and BAL cost basis breakdown looks as follows for 5 FTE:\n\n|Position|Cost Basis|\n| --- | --- |\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC + BAL vest)|$13,212.50|\n|$ / FTE / month (USDC)|$11,150|\n|$ / Freelance FTE / month (USDC)|$9,600|\n\n**Length of engagement: 6 months**\n\n**Budget: 398,135 USDC and 32,738 BAL**\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n**Impact on the Treasury**\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold 3,507,473 BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for the next half year would impact 0.93% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to 1.87% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold 5.727mln in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 6.95% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to 13.9%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `398135` USDC as `398135000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `32738` as `32738000000000000000000`.",

Balancer v3 documentation\n\n* Support in finalizing and further improving core components of documentation repository for v3\n\n8. UI Beta Testing and Support\n\n**Objectives for Growth Initiatives**\n\nPartner Onboarding Experience\n\n*  Provide an in-depth and comprehensive partner onboarding documentation for both Balancer v2 and Balancer v3 tech\n* Provide guides and content for the official documentation on how to integrate with Balancer as a partner\n* Advise partners on liquidity provisioning and assist in onboarding and any on-chain executions necessary.\n3. Onboard new liquidity on new chain deployments\n4. Assist in establishing new product launches such as the potential CoWAMM product.\n\nFinally, the Maxis team is committed to ensuring efficient on-chain operations for the Balancer DAO. We manage governance-related change control processes, oversee DevOps and multisig automation, and provide infrastructure guidance. Our responsibilities include automating on-chain tasks with OZ Defender and Chainlink Automation, developing smart contracts and tooling, supporting technical best practices, processing bi-weekly fees, and managing grant programs and incentive distributions. These efforts ensure smooth and reliable operations within the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview:** Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s):** Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers:** Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards**: YES\n\n### Domains of Operation\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\nKey Objectives per Operational Discipline:\n\n**1.

We will continue operating in a similar manner as in Q2, anticipating increased demand for automation work and partner support due to new product launches.\n\nOur spending will be closely monitored, with clear insights provided in our monthly reports, as demonstrated in Q2 2024. We believe this setup will significantly aid Balancer DAO in achieving its goals of becoming the hub for LRT, LST, and LRT liquidity.\n\nOverall, people costs in USDC terms will remain consistent with [previous quarters](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-568-fund-balancer-maxis-for-q2-2024/5625). The Maxis will receive part of their compensation in locked BAL, vesting over one year. With an average of 56% of compensation taken as locked BAL, this demonstrates our strong commitment and alignment with the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n**Length of engagement: 3 months**\n**Budget: 172’500 USDC and 14’464 BAL**\n\n### Cost Breakdown\n\n|Position|Cost per month|\n| --- | --- |\n|People Cost (USDC), 4.7 FTE|46’500 USDC|\n|People Cost, 4.7 FTE (BAL, with 1.25 multiplier) - Locked for 1 year|4’821 BAL|\n|Discretionary Budget to fund freelancers (2 FTE) and infrastructure cost (USDC)|20’000 USDC|\n\nFor Q3 the Maxis have decreased the ask for locked BAL resulting in a decrease of ask in the budget by 24'000 USD while also saving 27'000 USDC in Q2 from the discretionary budget which rolls over to Q3. This results in total savings of 51’000 USD compared to Q2.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: 0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325\n\n#### Impact on the Treasury\n\n**The Treasury wallets currently hold ~3.95M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q3 2024 would cost around 0.37% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.46% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.43M in stables. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 3.18% of the treasury’s stable reserve, which annualizes to ~12.7%.**\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount 172’500 USDC as `172500000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount 14’464 as `14464000000000000000000`.",

Recognized as key contributors and the vital link between partners and the protocol, our dedication to the DAO is unwavering. As we embark on another quarter, our commitment is not just to continue, but to evolve – to redefine our engagement and amplify our positive impact on the DAO in 2024.\n\nThe third quarter marked a significant transition for the Maxis. Following the departure of our strategic visionary, Solarcurve, we embraced change and innovation. Tritium rose to the occasion, leading critical initiatives like the [core pool incentive automation](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-457-core-pool-incentive-program-automation/5254), as well as securing and executing on the Arbitrum STIP, demonstrating our adaptability and resilience.\n\nOur evolution goes beyond roles and responsibilities. The Maxis are transforming from a collective of passionate enthusiasts to a team of full-time, professional experts. The new full-time addition consists of @Xeonus who will spearhead our strategic direction.\n\nOur mindful approach to funding allocation ensures an efficient use of resources – balancing USDC and BAL demands with maximum effectiveness. Our focus is not just on growth but on impact and transparency.\n\nIn 2024 we want to make the most impact by driving forward exciting initiatives while providing excellent mission-critical services to the DAO. We have identified four main (non-v3 dependent) initiatives to channel our efforts, while continuing to provide the core services that have been the backbone of the DAO for over two years.\n\n## Initiatives\n\nBeyond regular operations, the Maxi’s are focused on trying to create successful narratives in the Balancer ecosystem through various focused initiatives. In 2024, we strive to focus on a few of them, ensure that our focus areas have a clear leader/champion and some defined goals and that time and resources are available to focus on these topics. The impact of those topics is directly related to the achieved objectives.\n\n### Initiative 1: Growth beyond Mainnet\n\nLead: Tritium\n\nTeam: Shakotan (tech and operations), Xenous (data)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Grants Committee, Beethoven (Marketing + Beets grants)\n\nSummary\n\nThe initiative aims to further strengthen the DAO's presence beyond mainnet, focusing on Arbitrum, zkEVM, and Gnosis. The initiative emphasizes the successful execution of the Arbitrum STIP, but most of all development of strong competencies in creating data-driven narrative showcasing Balancer’s competitiveness, and collaboration with key blockchain partners such as Polygon and Aribtrum. The strategy includes adaptability to pivot based on market trends and performance metrics and an ever growing understanding of the KPIs that our grant providing partners care about.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Timely STIP Execution: Ensure punctual and successful delivery of the current STIP, including consistent reporting and active engagement with the DAO.\n2. Data Narrative Development: Work to build a competency within Balancer to tell stories about how we are using our emissions to drive growth for our protocol and in the ecosystems we exist in.\n\n  1. We should be able to put out velodrome style reports that tell our story.\n\n3. KPI-Focused Program Management: Stay close to various grant programs and look at successful grant recipients to understand the KPIs they set and how they achieve them.\n\n  1. Propose changes at Balancer to make this possible or point out why we are not well suited to meet the kinds of KPIs that chain ecosystems see value in.\n\n4. Next Grant Cycle Preparation: Identify potential grant sources for the upcoming cycle and strategize engagement.\n5. Feedback Integration: Actively seek and incorporate feedback to enhance the effectiveness of the initiative.\n6. STIP Comparative Analysis: Collaborate with the STIP body to assess and report on Balancer's performance in comparison to peers.\n7. Impact Report Creation: Develop a comprehensive report detailing the impact of extra incentives delivered through balancer on L2 ecosystems.\n8. Strategic Partnerships: Strengthen collaborations with Gnosis Chain, Base, Arbitrum and Polygon to share successes and apply learnings, particularly in the context of zkEVM scaling.\n9. Collaborate with Beets as much as possible to create a shared competency here.\n\n### Initiative 2: Redesign of the Gauge Framework v1\n\nLead: Xeonus\n\nTeam: Shakotan (building automation), Tritium, Zekraken, Zen Dragon and Mike B (design)\n\nSummary\n\nThis initiative aims to introduce an automated, dynamic system for evaluating and adjusting gauge emissions based on performance metrics. This new framework is designed to efficiently allocate BAL rewards, optimizing support for both high-cap and emerging projects. The goal is to ensure a more responsive and adaptable system that balances revenue optimization with nurturing potential future revenue generators.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. Automated Gauge Evaluation: Develop a system for automatic assessment of gauges based on predefined metrics.\n2. Dynamic Emission Cap Adjustments: Implement a mechanism to adjust emission caps (ranging from 2% to 10%) based on gauge performance, potentially reducing underperforming gauges to a certain cap (e.g. 0.5%).\n3. Adaptive Framework: Ensure the framework is responsive to market dynamics and capital efficiency, allowing for more flexible and efficient allocation of BAL rewards.\n4. Rules around Duplication: Rules for handling the same Token in multiple pools/chains or the same DAO with multiple tokens.\n\n### Initiative 3: Support Balancer v3 Design\n\nLead: Mike B\n\nTeam: Xeonus, Zen Dragon, Tritium, Shakotan(tech and automation)\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs, Beethoven (Tech)\n\nSummary: Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It's crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1. Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n2. Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings like TWAMMs, boosted pools, and dynamic ECLPs, and effectively pitch these to ecosystem projects.\n3. Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n4. Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n5. Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n### Initiative 4: Automation ownership transfer & on-chain automation improvements\n\nLead: Shakotan\n\nTeam: Tritium\n\nKey ecosystem interactions: Balancer Labs\n\nSummary:\n\nOngoing automation for both on-chain and off-chain processes. Improving existing operational contracts, such as Gauge injector and improving Defender codebase so it becomes maintainable.\n\nObjectives\n\n1. OZ Defender automation takeover from Balancer Labs and Markus\n2. Full tech and development for on-chain tasks\n3. ChildGaugeInjector version 2 release with new features + factory deployment to support better events and data used by Data Team\n4. Potential fees-handler-sc implementation to reduce rugability of the fees bags + improve data flow.\n\nService Provider Name & Overview: Balancer Maxis\n\nLeader(s): Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Danko, Tritium, Shakotan and Gosuto\n\nContributors (a.k.a.

Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q1 2024 would cost around 0.9% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~3.5% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury currently holds ~4.3M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.5% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~10%.\n\nFurthermore, this table provides an overview of the last years impact putting this proposal into perspective:\n\n|Year|Quarter|BAL|BAL Price|USDC|ETH|ETH price|Operations cost|People cost|Total|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|2023|Q1|48000|$6|$0.00|0|1201|0|$266,400|$266,400.00|\n|2023|Q2|42150|$7|$0.00|5|1795|8975|$291,257|$300,231.50|\n|2023|Q3|26025|$5|$132,630.00|20|1853|37060|$251,825|$288,884.50|\n|2023|Q4|31695|$3|$168,770.00|20|1652|33040|$271,779|$304,819|\n|2024|Q1|35718|$4|$108,095.00|20|2170|43400|$250,969|$294,369|\n\nAlthough the Maxis will have around 1 FTE more manpower at their disposal, the impact on the treasury stays nearly the same. Maxis have undergone internal optimizations in pay to reduce the impact on the DAOs USDC as much as possible given the current market conditions. In that regard, 49.5% of requested funding will be locked in our stkauraBAL vesting contract. We will also roll over $37,720.00 in savings from our Q3 and Q4 budget (bizdev, bounties etc.) and deduct that amount from the current proposal, which further reduced our overall demand for USDC.\n\nETH Address to Receive Funds: `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\nLink to SLA (if going through the Foundation): N/A\n\nTechnical specifications\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `108095` USDC as `108095000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing `transfer` passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `35718` as `35718000000000000000000`\n\nThe DAO Multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with WETH `0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2` by writing `deposit` with amount `20` to wrap the required ETH.

Balancer has pivoted as one of the main liquidity hubs for LRTs and LSTs. The Maxis have played a crucial role in making sure our various partners have a seamless experience while onboarding to Balancer tech.\n\nThis positive momentum, however, has also resulted in an immense increase in workload for Maxis, be it on the operational side or partner management. The group performed exceptionally, although we had changes in our team structure with Shakotan leaving and moving on to work for Radiant Capital.\n\nThe combination of increased responsibility and workload are key factors for us to focus on automating as many internal and on-chain processes as possible while also making the partner experience as seamless as possible - both for Balancer v2 and v3. We took a lot of learnings from Q1 and want to transition to a more professional Dev- and GovOps organization. We will therefore focus our efforts on 2 key initiatives: automation and stellar partner experience for v2 and v3. To achieve these goals we need a balance of retaining the current talented team and having enough flexibility to attract new talent for our various development tasks.\n\nAdditionally, we will undergo some structural modifications to reflect these changes: Danko and the Ballers will transition into the Balancer OpCo (Admin & Ops) for administrative and operations, ecosystem liaison and community mod tasks. This is an ideal opportunity as we further decentralize our SP landscape and strengthen our DAO, while also focusing the teams on what they are good at. Learn more about it on the Foundation’s funding [proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-xxx-year-three-funding-proposal-for-the-balancer-foundation/5627).\n\nWe are incredibly excited about the road ahead. Our protocol metrics show amazing performance across the board and we are dedicated to make sure Balancer will continue to be the go-to blue chip AMM in this market cycle!\n\n## Initiatives\n\nIn Q1, we introduced initiatives which helped us focus our efforts to specific work domains. In general, we had great experience with these work packages but will make sure to not overcommit this quarter with too many tasks, as smooth DAO operations are our highest priority. Therefore, we will focus our energy on 2 initiatives resulting in the highest possible impact for the DAO.\n\n### Initiative 1: Transition to a professional DevOps organization with Automation\n\n**Co-Leads**: Xeonus & Tritium\n\n**Team**: gosuto, Zekraken, Zen Dragon (and freelancers)\n\n**Summary**\nThe Balancer Maxis have been maintaining and operating key infrastructure in the DAO. These components include the [Fee sweep automation repo](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/protocol_fee_allocator), [Reward injectors](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/ChildChainGaugeInjectoooor) and [grant distribution automation](https://github.com/BalancerMaxis/STIP_automation). Furthermore, we were assigned the task to maintain and take over the OZ defender infrastructure making sure BAL gets streamed to all Balancer deployments.\n\nWe made significant advancements in Q1 but need to further focus on streamlining all these repositories. A main focus will also be set on migrating the infrastructure we took over from BLabs to a new version as the old one will be deprecated June 1st 2024. We therefore have a clear set of objectives to fulfill and also plan to use freelance resources to complete them.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n1. Fee Sweep Automation:\n* Refactor and improve code base incl. integration tests\n* Provide transparent and meaningful reports so that all DAO participants (investors and partners alike) can understand the mechanisms behind our core pool framework\n* Work together with Mimic or other partners to improve fee sweep performance\n*  Evaluate and improve voting incentive placements\n* Re-evaluate Aura fee recycling\n\n2. vlAURA Voting:\n* Provision automatic voting as outlined in [BIP-508](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-508-utilize-locked-aura-to-support-ecosystem-growth/5419)\n* Make the DAO owned vlAURA position easy to maintain (relocks etc).\n\n3. OZ Defender:\n* Establish a repository in the Balancer Maxis org\n* Implement deployment pipelines with the OZ API for professional CI/CD integration\n* Migrate to OZ Defender v2 and set up the enterprise tier subscription plan. The costs will be covered by Balancer OpCo.\n* Assess and negotiate the usage of a professional subscription to run our operations\n* Implement further monitoring\n* If possible, implement gas usage optimizations\n\n4. RewardsInjector v2\n* Finalize the new design\n* Write integration tests\n* Get a smart contract review\n* Make new contract ready to be used for Q3 latest\n\n5. Gauges and core pools\n* Automatic core pool detection and maintenance\n* Automatic gauge removal flagging\n\n### Initiative 2: Grow Balancer v2 and Support v3 Design\n\n**Lead**: MikeB\n\n**Team**: Maxis\n\n**Summary**\nBalancer v3 is in active development and set to go public with developer documentation and other collateral materials in April. Balancer v3 is set to compete with the established developer community of Uni v4. It’s crucial to foster the development of a robust ecosystem based on Balancer v3, ensuring it offers a compelling alternative for developers and projects.\n\nAt the same time, we strive to improve the quality of the partner experience for Balancer v2 while also supporting the launch on promising L2 chains with our technical expertise. Balancer v2 will remain a core component of the Balancer ecosystem and we strive to make it as easy to use as possible.\n\n**Objectives for v3 design**:\n\n* Onboarding of Innovative Teams: Attract and integrate teams that are developing novel automated market makers (AMMs) for Balancer v3.\n* Facilitate Hook Development: Bring innovative hooks to market through developer outreach and incentive alignment.\n* Market Fit Identification for v3 Products: Assess and establish the market relevance of v3 offerings..\n* Serving as a Liaison: Act as the primary point of contact for external teams working on Balancer v3, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration.\n* Technical Support Coordination: Collaborate with the integrations and BLabs teams to ensure that building teams receive adequate technical assistance.\n* Finalizing v3 Feature Scope: Conclude the initial feature set for Balancer v3, aligning it with market needs and developer capabilities.\n\n**Objectives for v2 growth:**\n* Improve partner experience supporting the marketing team with a consistent partner onboarding pack and process\n* Improved partner onboarding experience by streamlining internal processes\n* Streamline and simplify gauge on- and offboarding (incl. automatic flagging of deprecated gauges)\n\n**Service Provider Name & Overview**: Balancer Maxis\n\n**Leader(s)**: Xeonus, joined by the talented Mike B, Zekraken, Zen Dragon, Tritium and Gosuto\n\n**Contributors/Freelancers:** Hyferion, jalbrekt\n\n**Adhere to [[BIP-372] ](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-372-adopt-sp-standards/5009)and the SP standards:** YES\n\n**Pledge to abide by the DAO's [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Code-of-Conduct-fef15e2ed1f5453f8bd56f338c70bb88) (or link to your own):** YES\n\n**Pledge to abide by the [Accountability Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/balancergrants/Accountability-Guidelines-229d93372403415688f8d3dc4cb964b1):** YES\n\n**Domains of Operation:**\n\n* Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Strategy and Business Development\n* On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Data Analytics and Reporting\n\n**Key Objectives per Operational Discipline:**\n\n#### 1. Governance and Protocol Operations\n* Leading governance procedures, ensuring their execution and integrity.\n* Facilitating technical discussions within governance scopes.\n* Setting up governance votes and reviewing payloads for DAO transactions.\n* Crafting detailed governance proposals and specifications.\n* Offering deep technological insights during governance deliberations.\n* Assisting in specifications to proposals for proper payload execution\n* Infrastructure and tool creation for enhancing governance operations.\n* Automating tasks, reducing human dependency in governance functions.\n* Creating UI tools that support operational tasks (past examples: pool creation, reward injectors, linear pool deployment [deprecated])\n\n#### Strategy and Business Development\n* Applying profound product and technical knowledge in strategic planning.\n* Engaging with new partners and broader Web3 communities.\n* Providing technical support and insights for strategic development.\n* Assisting in custom pool creations and new chain launches.\n* Managing revenue flows and direct incentives with partners.\n* Facilitating discussions on financial incentives and revenue optimization.\n* Acting as active partner support and assisting new partners navigate the ecosystem\n\n#### 3. On-Chain Operations (DevOps)\n* Overseeing DevOps and automating multisig operations.\n* Building multisig payloads and conducting multi-person peer-reviews\n* Guidance on infrastructure-related aspects.\n* Overseeing Stipend Distribution Automation\n* Coordinating protocol fee sweep automation\n* Core development, aiding in automation and data management.\n* Smart contract development(when needed)\n* Taking over on chain automation for OZ Defender and migrating to new version of it\n* Support in technical best practices.\n* Bi-weekly fees processing and reporting\n* Grant program management and operations (if applicable)\n\n#### 4. Pool Design and Ecosystem Coordination\n* Designing pools for the protocol, aligning with governance specifications.\n* Liaising with the ecosystem for synchronized functionality and growth.\n* Assistance in pool design and migration to v3\n* Token whitelisting and front-end testing.\n* Assisting in the technical aspects of pool and gauge creation.\n* Testing of v3 front-end infrastructure\n\n#### 5. Data Analytics and Reporting\n* Spearheading data analytics, offering valuable insights through reports and dashboards.\n* Maintaining high-level expertise in protocol-related data.\n* Providing quarterly financial reports\n* Assisting in data handling, contributing to informed decision-making.\n\n#### Length of Engagement & Budget\n\nThe biggest adjustment in the Maxis funding proposal is the allocation of $60k USDC for discretionary budget for the entire quarter. Main reasons are the increased demand in resources to conclude tasks as described in the automation initiative like smart contract reviews, resource allocation for the OZ defender integration and stabilization of our platform. We will make sure to use these funds as conservatively as possible and will report on the usage in the monthly reports. Overall, people costs in USDC terms will be at par or below the [previous quarters](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-514-fund-balancer-maxis-q1-2024/5420) ($117,000 for Q2) as the Maxis will take part of their compensation in locked BAL vesting for 1 year. The fraction of locked BAL for compensation across contributors is 56% on average.\n\nWe have furthermore deducted following savings from this quarterly funding proposal:\n* 11,880 USDC\n* 800 BAL\n\n**Length of engagement:** 3 months\n\n**Budget:** `165,120 USDC` and `18,625 BAL`\n\n**ETH Address to Receive Funds:** `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325`\n\n#### Impact on the Treasury\n\nThe Treasury wallets currently hold ~4.2M BAL. Funding the Balancer Maxis for Q2 2024 would cost around 0.4% of the treasury’s BAL holdings, which annualizes to ~1.74% of the treasury’s BAL. The Treasury wallets currently hold ~5.78M in USDC. Funding the USDC portion would cost around 2.86% of the treasury’s USDC, which annualizes to ~11.43%.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nShakotan with address `0x8053484489b110181a6dba0b59dda887e433f470` will be offboarded from all relevant multi-sig safes and be replaced by gosuto.eth `0x11761c7b08287d9489CD84C04DF6852F5C07107b` (can be verified [here](http://github.com/BalancerMaxis/bal_addresses/blob/541d1f22cc498623880e219011c4cc24b5208caf/extras/signers.json#L2)). It is therefore proposed to swap Shakotan for gosuto in the [Balancer Maxi Signer](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/multisig.html#operational-multisigs-signer-set-aka-balancer-maxis) set. This grants signership to a number of 3/6 multisigs. Safes, signers and permissions can be understood by reviewing this [Table](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/governance/multisig.html#the-multisigs-and-their-addresses) in the docs.\n\nThe Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `165120` USDC as `165120000000`.\n\nFurthermore the Balancer DAO multisig `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` will interact with BAL `0xba100000625a3754423978a60c9317c58a424e3D` by writing transfer passing the Maxi Safe `0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325` as recipient and amount `18625` as `18625000000000000000000`.",
